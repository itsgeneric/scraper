 Definition 
 Purchasing power refers to how much money you can buy with a unit of currency; essentially, a measure of what your money is worth in terms of goods and services. 
    What Is Purchasing Power?    
  Purchasing power describes the amount of products or services that a single unit of money can acquire, reflecting the real-world value of currency in the marketplace. It can weaken over time due to  inflation . That's because rising prices effectively decrease the number of goods or services that one unit of money can buy. Purchasing power is also known as a currency's buying power.
 
 
  In investment terms, purchasing or  buying power  is the dollar amount of credit available to a customer based on the existing  marginable securities  in the customer's brokerage account.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a currency over time. Central banks adjust interest rates to try to keep prices stable and maintain purchasing power. One U.S. measure of purchasing power is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Globalization has linked currencies more closely than ever, so protecting purchasing power worldwide is crucial. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Inflation erodes purchasing power as prices rise. 
 Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Understanding Purchasing Power    
  Purchasing power affects every aspect of economics, from consumers buying goods to investors buying stock to a country’s economic prosperity.
 
 
  Inflation reduces a currency's purchasing power. Similarly, loss of purchasing power has the same effect as an increase in prices. To measure purchasing power in the traditional economic sense, you could compare the price of a good or service against a price index such as the  Consumer Price Index  (CPI).
 
 
  One way to understand purchasing power is to imagine that you worked the same job that your grandfather worked 40 years ago. Today, you would need a much higher salary to maintain the same quality of living. By the same token, a homebuyer looking for homes 10 years ago in the $300,000 to $350,000 price range had more and better options to consider than people have now in the same price range.

  When a currency’s purchasing power decreases due to excessive inflation, serious negative economic consequences can arise. These can include a higher  cost of living , higher interest rates that affect the global market, and  falling credit ratings . All of these factors can contribute to an economic crisis.
 
 
    Purchasing Power and CPI    
  Governments institute policies and regulations to  protect a currency’s purchasing power  and keep an economy healthy. They also monitor economic data to stay on top of changing conditions. For example, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  (BLS) measures price changes and announces those changes with CPI.
 
 
  CPI is one of the measures of inflation and purchasing power. It calculates the change in the weighted average of prices of consumer goods and services, and in particular, transportation, food, and medical care, at a given time. CPI can point to changes in the cost of living as well as  deflation .
 
 
  The CPI is just one official measure of purchasing power in the U.S.

"Capital: Definition, How It's Used, Structure, and Types in Business","Definition 
 Capital is a broad term for the money or other assets that are used by a business to generate returns. 
    What Is Capital?    
  Capital is a broad term that can describe anything that confers value or benefit to its owners, such as a factory and its machinery, intellectual property like patents, or the  financial assets  of a business or an individual.
 
 
  While money itself may be construed as capital, capital is more often associated with cash that is being put to work for productive or investment purposes. In general, capital is a critical component of running a business from day to day and financing its future growth.
 
 
  Business capital may derive from the operations of the business or be raised from debt or equity financing. When budgeting, businesses of all kinds typically focus on three types of capital: working capital, equity capital, and debt capital. A business in the financial industry identifies trading capital as a fourth component.
 
 
  Learn more about the types, sources, and structures of capital. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The capital of a business is the money it has available to pay for its day-to-day operations and to fund its future growth. The four major types of capital include working capital, debt, equity, and trading capital; trading capital is used by brokerages and other financial institutions. Any debt capital is offset by a debt liability on the balance sheet. The capital structure of a company determines what mix of these types of capital it uses to fund its business. Economists look at the capital of a family, a business, or an entire economy to evaluate how efficiently it is using its resources.

    Understanding Capital    
  From the economist's perspective, capital is key to the functioning of any unit, whether that unit is a family, a small business, a large corporation, or an entire economy.

  Capital assets can be found on either the current or long-term portion of the  balance sheet . These assets may include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as well as manufacturing equipment, production facilities, and storage facilities.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 In the broadest sense, capital can be a measurement of wealth and a resource for increasing wealth. Individuals hold capital and capital assets as part of their net worth. Companies have capital structures that define the mix of debt capital, equity capital, and working capital for daily expenditures that they use. 
 
 
 
  Capital is typically cash or  liquid assets  being held or obtained for expenditures. In a broader sense, the term may be expanded to include all of a company’s assets that have monetary value, such as its equipment, real estate, and inventory. But when it comes to budgeting, capital is cash flow.
 
 
  In general, capital can be a measurement of wealth and also a resource that provides for increasing wealth through direct investment or capital project investments. Individuals hold capital and capital assets as part of their net worth. Companies have capital structures that include debt capital, equity capital, and working capital for daily expenditures.
 
 
  How individuals and companies finance their working capital and invest their obtained capital is critical for their prosperity.
 
 
    How Capital Is Used    
  Capital is used by companies to pay for the ongoing production of goods and services to create profit. Companies use their capital to invest in all kinds of things to create value. Labor and building expansions are two common areas of capital allocation. By investing capital, a business or individual seeks to earn a higher return than the capital's costs.
 
 
  At the national and global levels, financial capital is analyzed by economists to understand how it is influencing economic growth. Economists monitor several metrics of capital including personal income and personal consumption from the  Department of Commerce ’s personal income and outlays reports. Capital investment also can be found in the quarterly gross domestic product ( GDP ) report.
 
 
  Typically, business capital and financial capital are judged from the perspective of a company’s capital structure. In the U.S., banks are required to hold a minimum amount of capital as a risk mitigation requirement (sometimes called  economic capital ) as directed by the central banks and banking regulations. 1 
 
 
  Other private companies are responsible for assessing their capital thresholds, capital assets, and capital needs for corporate investment.

 Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods or services between economic actors, where transactions occur only if both parties find them beneficial. 
    What Is Trade?    
  Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods or services between different economic actors. Since the parties are under no obligation to trade, a transaction will only occur if both parties consider it beneficial to their interests.
 
 
  Trade can have more specific meanings in different contexts. In financial markets, trade refers to purchasing and selling  securities ,  commodities , or  derivatives .  Free trade  means international exchanges of products and services without obstruction by  tariffs  or other  trade barriers .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Trade refers to the voluntary exchange of goods or services between economic actors. Since transactions are consensual, trade is generally considered to benefit both parties. In finance, trading refers to purchasing and selling securities or other assets. In international trade, the comparative advantage theory states that trade benefits all parties. Most classical economists advocate for free trade, but some development economists believe protectionism has advantages.

    How Trade Works    
  As a generic term, trade can refer to any voluntary exchange, from selling baseball cards between collectors to multimillion-dollar contracts between companies.
 
 
  In macroeconomics, trade usually refers to  international trade , the system of  exports and imports  that connects the global economy. A product sold to the global market is an  export , and a product bought from the global market is an  import . Exports can account for a significant source of wealth for well-connected economies.
 
 
 
 
  International trade results in increased efficiency and allows countries to benefit from  foreign direct investment  (FDI) by businesses in other countries. FDI can bring foreign currency and expertise into a country, raising local employment and skill levels. For investors, FDI offers company expansion and growth, eventually leading to higher revenues.
 
 
  A  trade deficit  is a situation where a country spends more on aggregate imports from abroad than it earns from its aggregate exports. A trade deficit represents an outflow of domestic currency to foreign markets. This may also be referred to as a negative  balance of trade  (BOT).

    International Trade    
  International trade occurs when countries put goods and services on the international market and trade with each other. Without trade between different countries, many modern amenities people expect to have would not be available.
 
 
    Comparative Advantage    
  Trade seems to be as old as civilization itself—ancient civilizations traded with each other for goods they could not produce for themselves due to climate, natural resources, or other inhibiting factors. The ability of two countries to produce items the other could not and mutually exchange them led to the principle of comparative advantage.
 
 
  This principle, commonly known as the  Law of Comparative Advantage , is popularly attributed to English political economist  David Ricardo  and his book  On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation  in 1817. However, Ricardo's mentor James Mill likely originated the analysis.

 Definition 
 A chief executive officer (CEO) is the highest-ranking executive in a company, serving as the primary communication link between the board of directors and the organization. 
    What Is a Chief Executive Officer (CEO)?    
  A chief executive officer (CEO) is the highest-ranking executive in a company. A CEO's primary responsibilities include making major corporate decisions, driving the workforce and resources of a company toward strategic goals, and acting as the main point of communication between the  board of directors  and corporate operations. The chief executive officer serves as the public face of the company in many cases.
 
 
  CEOs are elected by the board and its  shareholders .   They report to the chair and the board who are appointed by shareholders.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The chief executive officer (CEO) is the highest-ranking individual in a company. Every company differs but CEOs are often responsible for expanding the company, driving profitability, and improving share prices in the case of public companies.  CEOs manage the overall operations of a company. CEOs are often elected by the board of directors. Studies suggest that 45% of company performance is influenced by the CEO. Others show that they affect 15% of the variance in profitability.

    CEO’s Roles and Responsibilities    
  A CEO’s role varies by company depending on its size, culture, and corporate structure. CEOs in large corporations typically deal only with very high-level strategic decisions and those that direct the company’s overall growth.
 
 
  CEOs may work on strategy, organization, and culture. They may look at how capital is allocated across the firm or how to build teams to succeed. They can also set the tone, vision, and sometimes the culture of their organizations.
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 CEOs in smaller companies often are more hands-on and involved with day-to-day functions. 
 
 
 
  A study from Harvard Business Review analyzed how CEOs spend their time. They found that 72% of CEOs’ working time was spent in meetings. Of the remaining working time, 25% was spent on relationships, 25% on business unit and functional reviews, 21% on strategy, and 16% on culture and organization. The study showed that just 1% of their working time was spent on crisis management, and 3% was allocated to customer relations. 1

    Examples of a CEO’s Tasks    
  A chief executive officer’s roles and responsibilities also vary greatly between industries and organization sizes. A CEO may generally be expected to take on some or all of these tasks:
 
 
 
 Oversee the strategic direction of an organization :   Lower-level managers are often more engaged in the day-to-day operating activities of a company. A CEO usually synthesizes these results and decides on the long-term plans of a company. 
 Implement changes and proposed plans :   A   CEO usually looks to themselves and other executive leadership to begin implementing those plans after crafting the long-term vision. Changes are often directly implemented by operational managers but it's ultimately up to the CEO to ensure that the long-term plans are being followed through. 
 Engage in media obligations and public relations :   A CEO is often the face of the company and this includes being involved in media relations. A CEO may speak at conferences, address the public on notable changes to the company, or participate in community events. 
 Interact with other leadership executives : It's   vital to a company’s success to have a suite of executives that a CEO can rely on. A CEO often relies on other leaders to manage their own realms rather than directly overseeing every aspect of a company. They then engage with them to get a high-level understanding of how things are going.

What Is Magna Cum Laude?,"Definition 
 Magna cum laude is a Latin phrase that means “with great praise."" 
    What Is Magna Cum Laude?    
  Magna cum laude is a term used in academics to acknowledge that a student graduated with a grade point average (GPA) near the top of the class. In the U.S., there are three levels of academic distinction or Latin honors.  Cum laude , meaning ""with distinction,"" magna cum laude, or ""with great praise,"" and  summa cum laude , or ""with highest distinction."" 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Each college or university determines the GPA that earns the magna cum laude distinction. Latin honors are most commonly awarded with bachelor's degrees.  High schools may also grant Latin honors using the same phrasing. 
 
    Criteria    
  The awarding of Latin honors is common in colleges and universities in the United States. Latin honors are commonly awarded with bachelor's degrees. Students who graduate with honors may wear stoles of a distinct color or some other designation during commencement ceremonies, and their honors may be cited when their names are read. Magna cum laude is more prestigious than cum laude honors but less prestigious than summa cum laude. 1 
 
 
  Each institution defines the criteria. Some use GPA while others calculate their honors according to class placement. For example, a student in the top 3% of the class might qualify for a magna cum laude distinction. Colleges may consider other factors in their decisions to grant magna cum laude status.
 
 
  An institution might require that students complete an honors thesis to be eligible. Others seek letters of recommendation from faculty members. Some may require students to complete a certain number of advanced courses. 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Latin honors are generally noted in a student’s official transcript. 
 
 
 
    Examples    
   Texas A&M graduates must complete 60 credit hours while earning a GPA of 3.70 to 3.899 to earn a magna cum laude degree. 2 A student graduating magna cum laude in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, must finish in the top 5% to 10% of the class after completing 90 credits. For the 2024–2025 academic year, students must achieve a 3.938 GPA. 3 Brown University does not use a student’s GPA in its calculation since the school does not calculate GPAs. Students are eligible for just one Latin honor, magna cum laude, upon graduation by earning a high percentage of A grades and S for distinction marks for courses, as well as meeting other criteria as determined by the school. No more than 20% of a graduating class can earn magna cum laude honors. 4 
 
 
 
 
   What Other Honors Do Universities or Colleges Use? 
 Some schools have substituted other titles, such as “with distinction,” in place of or in addition to the traditional Latin terms. 
 
 
   Is Magna Cum Laude Important for Graduates? 
 The relative value of a magna cum laude degree or another Latin honor is difficult to judge as a factor in the job market. It may mean a great deal to some employers and nothing to others. It may benefit students competing for slots in graduate school. The top law schools, for example, expect students to have achieved certain GPAs as undergraduates—the type of high marks that are often accompanied by Latin honors. 
 
 
   What Do Latin Honors Indicate? 
 Graduating with honors notes that an individual has shown exemplary performance at school, particularly in academics. It indicates that an individual is capable of performing at the highest level. 
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  A college degree is a great achievement, but a new graduate with honors may stand out in a crowded field of job seekers or graduate school applicants. Latin honors such as a magna cum laude distinction indicate a student has consistently performed at a high level.

 Definition 
 Fixed income is a type of investment that provides the investor with a guaranteed return in interest or dividends in return for a lump-sum deposit. 
  Fixed income is a category of investments that pay regular  interest or dividend payments  over a set period of time. When that period expires, the investor gets back the original amount invested.
 
 
  Government and corporate bonds are the most common types of fixed-income products. These are essentially loans, which the borrower repays with interest. Preferred stock shares, which are a kind of hybrid of a stock and a bond, are fixed-income investments that pay guaranteed dividends.
 
 
  Investors can purchase fixed-income securities directly, or put their money into a fixed-income exchange-traded (ETF) or mutual fund.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Government and corporate bonds are the most common types of fixed-income products. 
 Fixed-income securities generally have  lower returns and lower risk  than stocks. 
 Bonds are rated for quality, with the safest bonds rated AAA or Aaa. 
 When a company goes bankrupt, fixed-income investors are paid before common stockholders. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Mira Norian 
 
    Understanding Fixed Income    
  Companies and governments issue  debt securities  to raise money to fund day-to-day operations and finance large projects. These  fixed-income instruments  pay a set interest rate return in exchange for investors lending their money. At the maturity date, investors are repaid the original amount that they invested. This amount is known as the principal.
 
 
    When a Company Issues a Bond    
  For example, a company might issue a 5% bond with a $1,000  face or par value  that matures in five years. The investor buys the bond for $1,000, and it will not be paid back until the end of the five years. Over the five years, the company makes interest payments— called coupon payments —based on a rate of 5% per year.

  As a result, the investor is paid $50 per year for five years. At the end of the five years (on the maturity date), the investor is repaid the $1,000 they invested initially. Investors may also find fixed-income investments that make coupon payments monthly, quarterly, or semiannually.
 
 
    Who Fixed Income Investments Are Best for    
  For  conservative investors  seeking a  diversified portfolio , fixed-income securities are recommended as a higher proportion of their holdings. The percentage of the portfolio dedicated to fixed income depends on the investor's investment style. An investor might also diversify their portfolio with a mix of fixed-income products and stocks, creating a portfolio of, for example, 50% fixed-income products and 50% stocks.
 
 
   Treasury bonds and bills , municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit (CDs) are all examples of fixed-income products. 
 
 
    Types of Fixed Income Products    
  A government or corporate bond is the most common example of a fixed-income security. Bonds can be bought directly (as with  TreasuryDirect  for Treasurys) or through the secondary market.
 
 
  Here are the most popular types of fixed-income products:

    What Is Value at Risk (VaR)?    
  Value at risk (VaR) is a statistic that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame. This  metric  is most commonly used by  investment  and  commercial banks  to determine the extent and probabilities of potential losses in their institutional portfolios.
 
 
  Risk managers use VaR to measure and control the level of risk exposure. One can apply  VaR calculations  to specific positions or whole portfolios or use them to measure firm-wide  risk exposure .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Value at risk (VaR) is a way to quantify the risk of potential losses for a firm or an investment. This metric can be computed in three ways: the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo methods. Investment banks commonly apply VaR modeling to firm-wide risk due to the potential for independent trading desks to unintentionally expose the firm to highly correlated assets.

    Understanding Value at Risk (VaR)    
  VaR modeling determines the potential for loss in the entity being assessed and the probability that the defined loss will occur. One measures VaR by assessing the amount of potential loss, the probability of occurrence for the amount of loss, and the time frame.
 
 
  For example, a financial firm may determine an asset has a 3% one-month VaR of 2%, representing a 3% chance of the asset declining in value by 2% during the one-month time frame. The conversion of the 3% chance of occurrence to a daily ratio places the odds of a 2% loss at one day per month.
 
 
  Using a firm-wide VaR assessment allows for the determination of the cumulative  risks  from aggregated positions held by different trading desks and departments within the institution. Using the data provided by VaR modeling, financial institutions can determine whether they have sufficient capital reserves in place to cover losses or whether higher-than-acceptable risks require them to reduce concentrated holdings.

    VaR Methodologies    
  There are three main ways of computing VaR: the historical method, the variance-covariance method, and the Monte Carlo method.
 
 
    Historical Method    
  The  historical method  looks at one’s prior returns history and orders them from worst losses to greatest gains—following from the premise that past returns experience will inform future outcomes. See “Value at Risk (VaR) Example” below for the formula and how it’s calculated.
 
 
    Variance-Covariance Method    
  Rather than assuming that the past will inform the future, the variance-covariance method, also called the  parametric method , instead assumes that gains and losses are  normally distributed . This way, potential losses can be framed in terms of  standard deviation  events from the mean.
 
 
  The variance-covariance method works best for risk measurement in which the distributions are known and reliably estimated. It is less reliable if the sample size is very small.
 
 
    Monte Carlo Method    
  A third approach to VaR is to conduct a  Monte Carlo simulation .

"XRT: What It Means, How It Works, Function Of Rights","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is XRT?    
  XRT is an extension printed after the  ticker symbol  for a stock. It indicates that the stock is trading on an  ex-rights  basis. (XRT is an abbreviation for the word ex-rights.) Ex-rights means that the buyer of the stock does not have the rights to purchase more shares at a lower price anymore because those rights have expired. XRT is printed on the ticker tape—or displayed on the electronic ticker—for clarity and to avoid disputes or confusion about where the rights currently remain. 
 
 
  XRT is also the ticker symbol for the  SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund  (ETF). This is an index fund that tracks a broad-based, equal-weighted index of U.S. retail industry stocks. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 XRT is an extension printed after the ticker symbol for a stock that indicates that the stock is trading on an ex-rights basis. Ex-rights means that the buyer of the stock does not have the rights to purchase more shares at a lower price anymore because those rights have expired. XRT is printed on the ticker tape—or displayed on the electronic ticker—for clarity and to avoid disputes or confusion about where the rights currently remain.  
 
    Understanding XRT    
  XRT is a symbol added as an extension to the ticker symbol for a stock that is trading ex-rights. On the ticker, the extension is added after a dot and after the ticker symbol. For example, a trade of stock Apex Borax Company with the ticker symbol ABC that is ex-rights would display as ""ABC.XRT"" on the ticker.
 
 
   Rights  are a type of financial instrument that give the purchaser of a stock the right to purchase more shares at a lower price than the trading price for the first month or two after the initial purchase. It is said that rights are ""attached"" to a stock, although in some cases these rights are detachable. After that specified initial time period in which the rights are attached, those rights expire; at this time, the stock is said to be traded ""ex-rights."" When a stock hits the rights expiration period and goes ex-rights, it usually trades for lower than it has been for a brief period of time, because the beneficial rights are no longer attached to it.
 
 
    The Function of Rights    
  The function of attaching rights to a stock through a rights offering is to facilitate buyers maintaining their position in the stock if the stock issues more shares not long after the buyer purchases. It functions similarly to the way a price guarantee does for the purchase of a retail product, in which the purchaser does not need to worry that the price of a product will skyrocket because the price is guaranteed for a certain period of time.
 
 
 
 
  This is the reason the price of the stock goes down when the rights expire because there is no longer a guarantee that the purchaser can maintain an ownership percentage at the same price. This makes the stock less valuable to the purchaser.

Investment Management: More Than Just Buying and Selling Stocks,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Investment management is the professional management of financial assets and securities to achieve specific investment goals for clients, which can include individual and institutional investors. 
    What Is Investment Management?    
  Investment management refers to the handling of an investment portfolio or a grouping of assets. It involves buying and selling assets, developing investment strategies, creating a tax strategy, and managing asset allocation. It can also include banking, budgeting, and other financial duties.
 
 
  The term most often refers to the management of holdings in an investment portfolio and trading them to achieve a specific investment objective. Investment management is also known as money management, portfolio management, or wealth management.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Investment management refers to the handling of financial assets and other investments by professionals for clients. Clients of investment managers can be individual or institutional investors. Investment management includes devising strategies and executing trades within a financial portfolio. Investment management firms handling over $25 million in assets must register with the SEC and accept fiduciary responsibility toward clients. 
 
    Understanding Investment Management    
  Professional investment management aims to meet particular investment goals for the benefit of clients whose money they have the responsibility of overseeing. These clients may be individual investors or  institutional investors , such as pension funds, retirement plans, governments, educational institutions, and insurance companies.
 
 
  Investment management services include asset allocation,  financial statement analysis , stock selection, monitoring of existing investments, and portfolio strategy and implementation. Investment management may also include financial planning and advising services, not only overseeing a client's portfolio but coordinating it with other assets and life goals.
 
 
 
 
  Professional managers deal with a variety of different  securities  and financial assets, including bonds, equities, commodities, and real estate. The manager may also manage real assets like precious metals, commodities, and artwork. Managers can help align investments to match retirement and estate planning as well as asset distribution. 
 
 
  According to an annual study by research and advisory firm Willis Towers Watson, the 500 largest investment managers had a combined total of $128 trillion in  assets under management (AUM)  at the end of 2023. This represents an increase of 12.5% from the previous year, which saw a decline of $18 trillion in AUM. 1 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 In  corporate finance , investment management includes ensuring a company's tangible and intangible assets are maintained, accounted for, and well-utilized. 
 
 
 
    Running an Investment Management Firm    
  Running an investment management business involves many responsibilities. The firm must hire professional managers to deal with, market, settle, and prepare reports for clients. Other duties include conducting internal audits and researching individual assets—or asset classes and industrial sectors.
 
 
  Aside from hiring marketers and training managers who direct the flow of investments, those who head investment management firms must ensure they move within legislative and regulatory constraints, examine internal systems and controls, account for cash flow, and properly record transactions and fund valuations.
 
 
  Generally, managers with at least $25 million in AUM or those who advise investment companies offering mutual funds must be  registered investment advisors (RIA) . 2  They must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and  state securities administrators  and agree to accept the  fiduciary  duty to their clients. This means they may face criminal liability if they don't act in their client's best interests. Those with less than $25 million in assets only register in their states. 3 
 
 
  Investment managers are usually compensated via a  management fee , which is a percentage of the value of the portfolio held for a client. Also, fees are typically on a sliding scale—the more assets a client has, the lower the fee they can negotiate. The average management fee is between 0.5% to 2%.
 
 
    Challenges of Investment Management    
    Market Behavior    
  The revenues of investment management firms are directly linked to the market's behavior. This connection means the company's profits depend on market valuations. Major asset price declines can lead to a drop in the firm's revenue, especially if the reduction is great compared to the ongoing and steady company costs.
 
 
  Clients may be impatient during hard times and bear markets, and even above-average fund performance may not be able to sustain a client's portfolio.

 Definition 
 A limited partnership (LP) is a business structure where at least two partners own the company, but only one of them manages the business. 
    What Is a Limited Partnership (LP)?    
  A limited partnership (LP) is a business structure where at least two partners own the company, but only one of them manages the business. The  general partner  has full  liability for the business  finances and is responsible for the actual  running of the business , while the other partner(s) only have limited liability up to the amount they invested. Limited partnerships are similar to  limited liability partnership (LLP) , but LLPs have no general partners. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Businesses with at least one partner and one limited partner are known as limited partnerships (LPs). Limited partners initially contribute to the business, and that investment amount becomes their liability in the company. General partners have full financial liability since they actively manage the business and its finances. LPs must usually register with the state where the business operates and file federal taxes. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Madelyn Goodnight / Investopedia 
 
    Features of a Limited Partnership (LP)    
  Limited partnerships are often a simple way for individuals to combine resources in order to purchase assets like real estate. One person is the general partner who is responsible for managing the  business and its finances . Because of this, the general partner has unlimited liability. On the other hand, limited partners do not involve themselves in the daily running of the business, so they're only liable for the amount of their investment.
 
 
  A partnership might form when limited  partners bring money , property, skills or expertise to the business. However, once the limited partner has made their contribution, they must step back from the business or risk being treated as a general partner (and assume more liability). That said, limited partnerships are not usually  taxed  as corporations. Instead, they're  pass-through entities , so each partner reports the finances on their own  personal taxes . 2 
 
 
   Note 
 Since limited partnerships (LPs) are business arrangements, all parties involved should agree to the terms of the partnership before registering with the state. 
 
  Be aware that limited partnerships do not have to be permanent arrangements. For instance, if the partnership is investment-based, the partners might agree on a limited duration LP, so the partnership dissolves after the investments are liquidated.
 
 
 
 
  While LPs offer great opportunities for individuals to pool resources, the structure can make it difficult for a partner to transfer their interest in the  business  to someone else. Specifically, they may need to get the approval of all other partners before making the deal. 
 
 
    Other Types of Partnerships    
  Limited partnerships have much in common with other types of  partnership s, but there are key differences, especially between general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. 
 
 
    General Partnership (GP)    
  Unlike an LP, where there is just one general partner, in a  general partnership (GP) , all partners are responsible for  running the business  and are fully liable. This also means all partners  share the profits  equally unless a different arrangement is stated in the partnership agreement document. 3 
 
 
  You might see a type of general partnership called a  joint venture . This arrangement is made for a single project, so the partnership dissolves wh",0 seconds of 56 seconds,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitedpartnership.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

    What Is a Stop-Loss Order?    
  A stop-loss order is a type of order used by traders to limit their loss or lock in a profit on an existing position. Traders can control their exposure to risk by placing a stop-loss order.
 
 
  Stop-loss orders are orders with instructions to close out a position by buying or selling a security  at the market  when it reaches a certain price known as the stop price.
 
 
  They are different from  stop-limit orders , which are orders to buy or sell at a specific price once the security's price reaches a certain stop price. Stop-limit orders may not get executed whereas a stop-loss order will always be executed (assuming there are buyers and sellers for the security). 1 
 
 
  For example, a trader may buy a stock and place a stop-loss order with a stop 10% below the stock's purchase price. Should the stock price drop to that 10% level, the stop-loss order is triggered and the stock would be sold at the best available price.
 
 
  Although most investors associate a stop-loss order with a long position, it can also protect a  short position . In such a case, the position gets closed out through an offsetting purchase if the security trades at or above a specific price.

   Key Takeaways 
 A stop-loss order instructs that a stock be bought or sold when it reaches a specified price known as the stop price. Once the stop price is met, the stop order becomes a market order and is executed at the next available opportunity. Stop-loss orders are used to limit loss or lock in profit on existing positions.  They can protect investors with either long or short positions. A stop-loss order is different from a stop-limit order, the latter of which must execute at a specific price rather than at the market. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    How Stop-Loss Orders Work    
  Traders or investors may choose to use a stop-loss order to limit their losses and protect their profits. By placing a stop-loss order, they can manage risk by exiting a position if the price for their security starts moving in the direction opposite to the position that they've taken.
 
 
 
 
  A stop-loss order to sell is a customer order that instructs a broker to sell a security if the market price for it drops to or below a specified stop price. A stop-loss order to buy sets the stop price above the current market price. 1 
 
 
    Advantage Over a Stop-Limit Order    
  A stop-loss order becomes a market order to be executed at the best available price if the price of a security reaches the stop price. A stop-limit order also triggers at the stop price. However, the limit order might not be executed because it is an order to execute at a specific (limit) price. Thus, the stop-loss order removes the risk that a position won't be closed out as the stock price continues to fall. 1 
 
 
    Potential Disadvantages    
  One disadvantage of the stop-loss order concerns price gaps. If a stock price suddenly gaps below (or above) the stop price, the order would trigger. The stock would be sold (or bought) at the next available price even if the stock is trading sharply away from your stop loss level.

    What Is Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)?    
  Days sales outstanding (DSO) is a measure of the average number of days that it takes a company to collect payment for a sale. DSO is often determined on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.
 
 
  To compute DSO, divide the average accounts receivable during a given period by the total value of credit sales during the same period, and then multiply the result by the number of days in the period being measured.
 
 
  Days sales outstanding is an element of the  cash conversion cycle  and may also be referred to as days receivables or  average collection period .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Days sales outstanding (DSO) is the average number of days it takes a company to receive payment for a sale. A high DSO number suggests that a company is experiencing delays in receiving payments, which can result in a cash flow problem. A low DSO indicates that the company is getting its payments quickly. That money can be put back into the business to good effect. Generally speaking, a DSO under 45 days is considered low. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    Understanding Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)    
  Given the vital importance of cash flow in running a business, it is in a company's best interest to collect its outstanding  accounts receivables  as quickly as possible. Companies can expect, with relative certainty, that they will be paid their outstanding receivables. But because of the  time value of money  principle, time spent waiting to be paid is money lost. 
 
 
  That said, the definition of ""quickly"" depends on the business. In the financial industry, relatively long payment terms are common. In the agriculture and fuel industries, fast payment can be crucial. In general, small businesses rely more heavily on steady cash flow than large, diversified companies. 1

   Tip 
 By quickly turning sales into cash, a company has a chance to put the cash to use again more quickly. 
 
 
 
    What the Numbers Tell You    
  A high DSO number shows that a company is selling its product to customers on credit and waiting a long time to collect the money. This can lead to cash flow problems. A low DSO value means that it takes a company fewer days to collect its accounts receivable. That company is promptly getting the money it needs to create new business.
 
 
 
 
  In effect, determining the average length of time that a company’s outstanding balances are carried in receivables can reveal a great deal about the nature of the company’s cash flow.
 
 
  It is important to remember that the formula for calculating DSO only accounts for credit sales. While cash sales may be considered to have a DSO of 0, they are not factored into DSO calculations. If they were factored into the calculation, they would decrease the DSO, and companies with a high proportion of cash sales would have lower DSOs than those with a high proportion of credit sales.

"Zig Zag Indicator: Definition, How Pattern Is Used, and Formula","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Zig Zag Indicator?    
  The Zig Zag indicator lowers the impact of random price fluctuations and is used to help identify price  trends  and changes in price trends.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Zig Zag indicator lowers the impact of random price fluctuations and is used to identify price trends and changes in price trends. The indicator lowers noise levels, highlighting underlying trends higher and lower. The Zig Zag indicator works best in strongly trending markets. 
 
    Understanding the Zig Zag Indicator    
  The Zig Zag indicator plot points on a chart whenever prices reverse by a  percentage greater than a pre-chosen variable . An analyst can set the percentage level to trigger the indicator. Straight lines are then drawn, connecting these points.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   TradingView. 
 
  The indicator is used to help identify price trends. It eliminates random price fluctuations and attempts to show trend changes. Zig Zag lines only appear when there is a price movement between a  swing high  and a swing low that is greater than a specified percentage—often 5%. By filtering minor price movements, the indicator makes trends easier to spot in all time frames.
 
 
  The Zig Zag indicator is often used in conjunction with  Elliot Wave Theory  to determine the positioning of each wave in the overall cycle. Traders can experiment with different percentage settings to see what gives the best results. For example, a setting of 4% may define waves more clearly than a setting of 5%. Stocks have their own patterns, so it is likely that traders will need to optimize the Zig Zag indicator’s percentage setting to suit those  securities . 
 
 
 
 
  Although the Zig Zag indicator does not predict future trends, it helps to identify potential  support and resistance  zones between plotted swing highs and swing lows. Zig Zag lines can also reveal reversal patterns, i.e.  double bottoms  and head and shoulders tops. Traders can use popular technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI) and the stochastics oscillator to confirm whether the price of a security is overbought or oversold when the Zig Zag line changes direction.
 
 
   Tip 
 A  momentum investor  might use the indicator to stay in a trade until the Zig Zag line confirms in the opposite direction. For example, if the investor holds a  long position , they would not sell until the Zig Zag line turns downward. 
 
 
 
    The Zig Zag Indicator Formula    
   ZigZag ( HL , % c h a n g e = X , r e t r a c e = FALSE , L a s t E x t r e m e = TRUE ) If  % c h a n g e > = X , plot ZigZag where: HL = High-Low price series or Closing price series % c h a n g e = Minimum price movement, in percentage R e t r a c e = Is change a retracement of the previous move or an absolute change from peak to trough? L a s t E x t r e m e = If the extreme price is the same over multiple periods, is the extreme price the first or last observation? \begin{aligned} &\text{ZigZag}(\text{HL}, \%change=X, retrace=\text{FALSE},\\ &LastExtreme=\text{TRUE})\\ &\text{If } \%change >=X, \text{plot ZigZag}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{HL}=\text{High-Low price series or Closing price series}\\ &\%change=\text{Minimum price movement, in percentage}\\ &Retrace=\text{Is change a retracement of the previous}\\ &\text{move or an absolute change from peak to trough?}\\ &LastExtreme=\text{If the extreme price is the same over}\\ &\text{multiple periods, is the extreme price the first or}\\ &\text{last observation?}\\ \end{aligned} ​ ZigZag ( HL , % c h a n g e = X , r e t r a c e = FALSE , L a s t E x t r e m e = TRUE ) If  % c h a n g e > = X , plot ZigZag where: HL = High-Low price series or Closing price series % c h a n g e = Minimum price movement, in percentage R e t r a c e = Is change a retracement of the previous move or an absolute change from peak to trough? L a s t E x t r e m e = If the extreme price is the same over multiple periods, is the extreme price the first or last observation? ​ 
 
 
    How To Calculate the Zig Zag Indicator    
 
 Choose a starting point (swing high or swing low). 
 Choose % price movement. 
 Identify next swing high or swing low that differs from the starting point = > % price movement. 
 Draw  trendline  from starting point to new point. 
 Identify next swing high or swing low that differs from the new point = > % price movement. 
 Draw trendline. 
 Repeat to most recent swing high or swing low. 
 
 
    Zig Zag Indicator Limitations    
  Like other  trend-following indicators , buy and  sell signals  are based on past price history that may not be predictive of future price action. For example, the majority of a trend may have already happened when a Zig Zag line finally appears.
 
 
  Traders should be aware the most recent Zig Zag line may not be permanent. When price changes direction, the indicator starts to draw a new line. If that line does not reach the indicator’s percentage setting and the price of the","By

"Haircut: What It Means in Finance, With Examples","What Is a Haircut?    
  Broadly speaking, the term “haircut” refers to the reduction, or trimming, of an asset’s value. There are a couple different contexts in which it can be applied.
 
 
  It’s most often used to express the reduction in value of the collateral used to  secure a loan . This trim is meant to offset the risk that, should the borrower fail to repay their debt, the collateral's  market value  will decrease before it can be sold. Similarly, a haircut can also refer to a markdown in the value of debt, such as in a sovereign debt crisis.
 
 
  Another, albeit less common, use of the term is in reference to a market maker's  bid-ask spread . When buying stocks, for example, you're usually taking a small haircut in the sense that the market maker is profiting by selling slightly below or buying slightly above the market price.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 In a financial context, a haircut can apply to a few different situations, such as the reduction in collateral's value or the cut a market maker takes. Haircuts affect how much a borrower can take out with a secured loan. Haircuts often reflect that the value of an underlying asset can be volatile. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou 
 
    How a Haircut Works    
  In order to understand how a haircut works, it's important to first understand  collateral . When a lender requires you to pledge assets against the cash you borrow, those assets are considered collateral. If you can't repay what you borrow, the lender can sell the collateral to recoup their losses. A simple example is a  home equity loan , in which your home is pledged as collateral.
 
 
  However, haircuts aren't all that common for individual borrowers. Instead, they’re more often used when financial institutions lend to one another. With a  repurchase agreement (repo) , for instance, a financial institution borrows cash on a short-term basis, usually overnight. In doing so, they pledge an asset like government bonds as collateral to the lender. But the lender usually applies a haircut because the value of those assets can fluctuate.
 
 
  With a 5% haircut on $1 million in bonds, for example, the repo borrower could only take out a loan for $950,000. However, if they instead pledge $1,050,000 in bonds, then they could borrow $1 million.
 
 
 
 
    How Is a Haircut Calculated?    
  There's not a universal formula for determining haircuts, as it can vary from one lender to another. However, each calculation will likely take the following factors into consideration:
 
 
 
 Volatility :   Assets tend to fluctuate in price more than the cash being loaned. So if the collateral's value is more prone to volatility, the lender generally requires a greater haircut. 
 Liquidity : Typically the less liquid the collateral, the larger the haircut, due to the difficulty and potential loss in value that comes from having to quickly sell an illiquid asset. 
 Price/credit risk : A larger haircut is also usually required if an asset is particularly risky. For example, a corporate bond might be fairly volatile and have a higher risk of permanently losing value due to default, thus the haircut would be higher. 
 Borrower risk : The borrower's individual credit risk can also make a difference. If a borrower is more likely to default, then a lender is less likely to be repaid, so a higher haircut would offset that risk. 
 
 
    How a Haircut Works for Market Makers    
  When looking at a stock quote, for example, the price you see is usually the last traded price. In fast-moving markets, this is typically around the midpoint between current offers to buy or sell the stock. Sellers set the ask price, and buyers set the bid price, with the gap known as  the spread .
 
 
  Market makers are typically firms that provide liquidity to markets by participating in both sides of the trade for certain securities. Because of their size, speed, and relationships, market makers can often profit off the spread by buying at the bid price and selling for slightly more at the ask price. 
 
 
  Meanwhile, the trader on the other side of that transaction takes a small haircut, since they're either paying slightly more or selling for slightly less than the market price.
 
 
    Example of a Market Maker Haircut    
  Suppose you own 100 shares of Company XYZ. The stock quote says it's trading at $50 per share, but the bid is $49.98 and the ask is $50.02. So, if you place a market order to sell the stock, it would get filled at the next best available price, which in this case means you'd sell at the bid price of $49.98, so you'd get $4,998—aside from any brokerage or regulatory fees—rather than $5,000.
 
 
  Then, suppose you changed your mind and wanted to buy back in. If the ask price is still $50.02, you would spend $5,002 to get your shares back, meaning you lost $4 due to the differences between the bid-ask prices. That $4 is essentially a haircut that the market maker collected by buying low from you an","By

"JPY (Japanese Yen): Definition, Symbol, History, Trading","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is JPY (Japanese Yen)?    
  JPY is the abbreviation for the Japanese yen, the currency of Japan. The yen is often represented with a symbol that looks like the capital letter Y with two horizontal dashes through the center: ¥. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Japanese yen is the world's third-most traded currency, behind the U.S. dollar and the euro. 2 The yen, usually a safe haven during times of market stress, dropped to 24-year lows against the dollar in mid-2022. 3 The yen's drop was fueled by the refusal of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to follow other central banks in raising interest rates. 4 The BoJ has set a 2% inflation target for Japan following decades of economically damaging deflation. 4 
 
    Understanding JPY (Japanese Yen)    
  The Japanese yen is the third-most traded currency in the  foreign exchange market  after the  U.S. dollar (USD)  and the  euro . The yen figured in trades accounting for 16.8% of foreign currency trading turnover in a 2019 survey, compared with more than 88.3% for the dollar and 32.3% for the euro. 5 
 
 
  The yen is also a distant third behind the U.S. dollar and the euro as the denomination of official  foreign exchange reserves , with the reserves held in dollars exceeding those in yen more than 10-fold as of Q4 2021. 2 
 
 
  Japan's  current account  surplus stemming from its role as a major  net exporter  limits the accumulation of yen by foreign  central banks . 6 
 
 
    JPY Denominations    
  Coins worth 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 yen are in circulation alongside ¥1,000, ¥2,000, ¥5,000, and ¥10,000 banknotes. The Japanese count sums in multiples of 10,000 yen rather than 1,000 as in the West with U.S. dollars or euros. 1 
 
 
  Some Japanese yen banknote denominations are scheduled for a redesign by 2024. The new 10,000 yen note is to feature Eiichi Shibusawa, a Japanese industrialist in the 19th and early 20th centuries known as the ""father of Japanese capitalism."" The 5,000 yen note will feature Umeko Tsuda, who founded Tsuda University in Tokyo, pioneering women's education. The new 1,000 yen note will honor the medical scientist Shibasaburo Kitasato. The new bills will incorporate 3D holograms. 7 
 
 
 
 
    History of the Japanese Yen    
  The yen's name is a derivative of “en,” the Japanese term for circle, or round object that itself is derived from ""yuan,"" a Chinese term for imported silver coins. The Meiji government adopted the yen in 1871, replacing the metal coinage of the Tokugawa shogunate that preceded it as well as the patchwork of paper  scrip  issued by many of the country's feudal lords. 8 
 
 
  The  Bank of Japan (BoJ)  was created in 1882 as a  central bank , and granted sole power to issue currency in 1884, producing its first yen banknote the following year. After a period of steady devaluation against the Canadian and U.S. dollars, Japan followed the U.S. and Canada by adopting the  gold standard  in 1897. 8 
 
 
  World War II destroyed the value of the yen, and U.S. occupation authorities after the war imposed a complex web of regulated exchange rates while steadily depreciating the yen against the dollar amid rapid inflation. The yen's value was pegged to the dollar in 1949 but allowed to float in 1973 following the collapse of the  Bretton Woods system  of fixed currency exchange rates. 9 
 
 
  The 1985  Plaza Accord  agreement led to the managed depreciation of the U.S. dollar that more than doubled the value of the Japanese yen against the dollar by 1988, from ¥239 to ¥123 per $1. 10 11 
 
 
  After decades of ensuing  deflation , the BoJ has set a 2% inflation target and pursued an aggressive  quantitative easing  program. 4 
 
 
    JPY's Safe Haven Status    
  The Japanese yen has long been considered a  safe haven . The currency often appreciates in value during periods of risk aversion in financial markets. Low domestic interest rates in Japan amid deflation have encouraged the country's financial institutions and households to seek out higher yields overseas, a tendency known as the  carry trade . When such investment flows reverse in times of market stress, the yen has tended to gain on the U.S. dollar. 
 
 
  In mid-2022, however, the JPY slumped to a 24-year low against the U.S. dollar as the BoJ kept its policy rate near zero while the  Federal Reserve  raised the  federal funds rate  to fight high  inflation . 3  Rising consumer prices aggravated by the yen's decline had become a political issue in Japan ahead of national elections. 12

    Trading Japanese Yen    
  Unless you're a savvy currency trader with a strong appetite for risk, it's probably best not to get involved with the yen at any time, especially during periods when it's under pressure. Nevertheless, pros and brave amateurs can  trade the yen  in the global forex marketplace, which permits a great deal of position leverage and","By

The Role of Commercial Banks in the Economy,"Close 
 
 
 
  Many of us share a fairly basic view of banks. They are places to store money, make basic investments like  term deposits , sign up for a  credit card , or get a loan. Behind this mundane view, however, is a highly regulated system that ties our day-to-day banking back into the wider  financial system . Learn more about commercial banks, how they are created, and what their larger purpose is in the overall economy.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Banking is a highly regulated system that ties our day-to-day banking back into the wider financial system. 
 There are thousands of commercial banks in the United States alone. 
 Until the late 1990s,  investment banks  helped companies issue shares and commercial banks primarily were concerned with deposits and lending, thanks to the  Glass-Steagall Act . 
 From the late 1990s onward, the ability to enforce Glass-Steagall eroded and the act was effectively repealed. 
 
 
 
    When Is a Bank a Commercial Bank?    
  Between 1933 and 1999, it was fairly easy to tell banks apart, thanks to the Glass-Steagall Act. If you helped companies issue shares, you were an investment bank. If you were primarily concerned with deposits and lending, then you were a commercial bank. From the late 1990s onward, however, the ability to enforce Glass-Steagall as a black-and-white rule eroded and the act was effectively repealed. 1 
 
 
  Since then, the old distinction between a commercial bank and an investment bank is essentially meaningless. For example, as of March 31, 2024, JPMorgan Chase Bank is the largest commercial banks in the U.S. by assets; in 2012, the same bank was one of the  lead underwriters  in the Facebook  initial public offering (IPO) . 2 3 
 
 
   Important 
 Commercial banks provide a range of financial services to individuals and businesses so they can carry out simple financial tasks. 
 
 
 
  For better or worse, we’ve lost the issuance of securities and active investment in securities as defining actions that a commercial bank cannot take. Instead, we can look at the actions all commercial banks share.
 
 
 
 
    Commercial banks    
 
 Accept deposits 
 Lend money 
 Process payments 
 Issue  bank drafts  and checks 
 Offer safety deposit boxes for items and documents 
 
 
  There are more actions, of course, and finer categories within this broad view. Commercial banks may offer other services such as brokering insurance contracts, giving  investment advice , and so on. They also provide a wide variety of loans and offer other credit vehicles like cards and  overdrafts . However, the common theme among these activities is that they are aimed at providing a financial service to an individual or business.
 
 
    From Zero to Operational in 2 Years or Less    
  To understand commercial banking, it is worth looking at how they are established. Although big banks like JPMorgan Chase,  Wells Fargo , and Citibank are well-known and global in scope, there are thousands of commercial banks in the United States alone. 4 
 
 
  Despite the seemingly large number, starting and operating a commercial bank is a long process due to the regulatory steps and capital needs. Rules vary by state, but in the U.S., an organizing group begins the process by securing several million dollars in  seed capital . This capital brings together a management team with experience in the banking industry as well as a board.
 
 
    Creating the Vision    
  Once the board and management are set, a location is selected and the overall vision for the bank is created. The organizing group then sends its plan, along with information on the board and management, to regulators who review it and decide if the bank can be granted a charter. The review costs thousands of dollars and the plan may be sent back with recommendations that need to be addressed for approval.
 
 
    Path to Becoming Operational    
  If the charter is granted, the bank must be operational within a year. In the next 12 months, the organizers must get their  FDIC insurance  paid, secure staff, buy equipment, and so on, as well as go through two more regulatory inspections before the doors can open. 5 
 
 
    Timing    
  This timing on the entire process can vary, but including preparation before the first filing to regulators, it is measured in years, not months. To get to the stage where a bank can make money by leveraging deposited dollars as consumer loans, there need to be millions in capital, some of which can be raised in private circles and paid back through an eventual public share offering.
 
 
  In theory, a charter bank can be 100% privately funded, but most banks go public because the shares become liquid, making it easier to pay out investors. Consequently, having an IPO in the original plan makes it easier to attract early-stage investors as well.

  The process of launching a commercial bank foreshadows the overall role that these banks play in th","By

    What Is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?    
  The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) describes the relationship between  systematic risk , or the general perils of investing, and  expected return  for assets, particularly stocks. It is a finance model that establishes a linear relationship between the required return on an investment and risk.
 
 
  CAPM is based on the relationship between an asset’s  beta , the  risk-free rate  (typically the  Treasury bill  rate), and the  equity risk premium , or the expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate.
 
 
  CAPM evolved as a way to measure this systematic risk. It is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky  securities  and generating expected returns for assets, given the risk of those assets and  cost of capital .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The capital asset pricing model, or CAPM, is a financial model that calculates the expected rate of return for an asset or investment. CAPM does this by using the expected return on both the market and a risk-free asset, and the asset’s correlation or sensitivity to the market (beta). There are some limitations to the CAPM, such as making unrealistic assumptions and relying on a linear interpretation of risk vs. return. Despite its issues, the CAPM formula is still widely used because it is simple and allows for easy comparisons of investment alternatives. For instance, it is used in conjunction with modern portfolio theory (MPT) to understand portfolio risk and expected return. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Jessica Olah / Investopedia 
 
    Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Formula    
  The formula for calculating the expected return of an  asset , given its  risk , is as follows: 1 
 E R i = R f + β i ( E R m − R f ) where: E R i = expected return of investment R f = risk-free rate β i = beta of the investment ( E R m − R f ) = market risk premium \begin{aligned} &ER_i = R_f + \beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &ER_i = \text{expected return of investment} \\ &R_f = \text{risk-free rate} \\ &\beta_i = \text{beta of the investment} \\ &(ER_m - R_f) = \text{market risk premium} \\ \end{aligned} ​ E R i ​ = R f ​ + β i ​ ( E R m ​ − R f ​ ) where: E R i ​ = expected return of investment R f ​ = risk-free rate β i ​ = beta of the investment ( E R m ​ − R f ​ ) = market risk premium ​ 
 
 
 Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the  time value of money . The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for the  investor  taking on additional risk. 
 The  goal of the CAPM formula  is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared with its expected return. In other words, by knowing the individual parts of the CAPM, it is possible to gauge whether the  current price  of a stock is consistent with its likely return.

"U.S. Savings Bonds: Definition, How They Work, Types, and Taxes","Close 
 
 
 
    What Are U.S. Savings Bonds?    
  A U.S. savings bond is a government bond offered to its citizens to help fund federal spending, and which provides savers with a guaranteed, although modest, return. These bonds are issued with  zero coupon  at a discount with an implied fixed rate of interest over a fixed period of time. For instance, Series EE savings bonds are sold at 50% of their face value, and mature to their full value after 20 years.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 U.S. savings bonds are a form of government debt issued to American citizens to help fund federal expenditures. Savings bonds are sold at a discount and mature to their full face value, and do not pay regular coupon interest. Series EE bonds are sold at half of face value and mature in 20 years. Series I bonds are adjusted for inflation. As opposed to higher risk, complex corporate bonds, U.S. savings bonds tend to return lower returns while taking on less risk.  
 
    Understanding U.S. Savings Bonds    
  A U.S. savings bond is a common type of  government bond , which is a  bond  issued by a governmental body to raise funds from the public to fund its capital projects and other operations necessary to manage the economy. When the government sells bonds, it is in effect taking a loan from the public, which it promises to pay back at some predetermined date in the future. As compensation for providing it with capital, the government makes interest payments to its bondholders. 
 
 
  Many people find these bonds attractive because they are  not subject to state or local income taxes . These bonds cannot easily be transferred and are non-negotiable.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 In order to purchase or redeem a U.S. savings bond, an investor must be a U.S. citizen, official U.S. resident, or U.S. government employee (regardless of citizenship status). 
 
 
 
    History of the U.S. Savings Bond    
  In 1935, during the  Great Depression , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation that allowed the  U.S. Department of the Treasury  to issue federally backed savings bonds, Series A. In 1941, the Series E bond was first issued to help finance World War II and were called Defensive Bonds. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, they were called War Savings Bonds, and the money invested in them went directly toward the war effort.
 
 
 
 
  After the war ended, Americans were encouraged to purchase savings bonds, which provided a way for individuals and families to earn returns on their investments while enjoying the absolute guarantee of the United States government. 
 
 
    Features of U.S. Savings Bonds    
 
 Non-Marketable : The U.S. savings bond was designed to be  non-marketable , meaning that an investor can only purchase the bond directly from the U.S. government and cannot sell it to any other investor. The bond, in effect, cannot be transferred, as it represents a contract between the investor and the U.S. government. This direct relationship ensures that the U.S.  savings bond  does not fluctuate in  value . Therefore, an investor would receive their original investment if they redeemed the bond. Furthermore, any lost or damaged savings bond certificate can be reissued or replaced, since the bond is registered with the government. 
 Purchase : An investor can buy the bonds in penny increments with a minimum investment value of $25 and a maximum value of $10,000. A bond investor cannot buy more than $10,000  face value  of U.S. savings bonds in a  calendar year . U.S. savings bonds can only be purchased and redeemed electronically through the  TreasuryDirect website  administered by the government. The investor must open a TreasuryDirect account and provide a Social Security Number (SSN), checking or savings account, and email address. 
 Interest payment : U.S. savings bonds are  zero-coupon bonds  that do not pay interest until they are redeemed or until the maturity date. The interest compounds semi-annually and accrues every year for 30 years. After a bond has been held for 30 years, it will no longer generate interest payments to the investor. An investor who purchases the bond at the end of the month will still receive the  interest accrued  for the entire month. Any interest paid at redemption or maturity date is issued electronically to the bondholder’s designated bank account. 
 Early redemption : The time it takes for a bond to mature varies, but it is often between 15 and 30 years. A bondholder must wait at least 12 months after the initial purchase before redeeming the savings bond, at which point they will receive the face value plus interest.

However, redeeming a bond after holding it for five years does not incur any penalty.

What Was ZZZZ Best? How the Ponzi Scheme Creator Was Caught,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Was ZZZZ Best?    
  ZZZZ Best was a carpet cleaning and restoration company founded by Barry Minkow that served as a front for a famous  Ponzi scheme . The company went public in December 1986 and was quickly valued at over $300 million. Within just seven months of the  initial public offering  (IPO), however, ZZZZ Best was bankrupt and its assets were auctioned for approximately $64,000. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 ZZZZ Best was a company set up as a front for a Ponzi scheme. Its founder Barry Minkow engaged in a range of criminal acts including insurance scams and check kiting. Minkow and his business associate Tom Padgett set up a fake company called Interstate Appraisal to defraud financial institutions out of millions. Minkow was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud. When released, he ended up convicted for fraud again and sentenced to five more years. The fraud was discovered by a woman who chased the paper trail, all due to an overcharge of only a few hundred dollars. 
 
    Understanding ZZZZ Best    
  Barry Minkow formed ZZZZ Best in his parents' garage. The business performed poorly and 15-year-old Minkow was often inundated with customer complaints and supplier collection requests. To create an illusion of a profitable business, Minkow began committing criminal acts, such as  check kiting , theft, insurance scams, and fraud, to fund operations and pay suppliers. 2 
 
 
  Within a few years of ZZZZ Best's inception, Minkow launched fictitious insurance restoration and appraisal businesses. While active, ZZZZ Best was at the center of a credit card scheme involving over $70,000 in fraudulent charges. Although Minkow assigned blame to contractors and employees, he repaid all of the victims except for one: a homemaker swindled out of a few hundred dollars. 3 
 
 
    The Scheme and the Downfall    
  Minkow and business associate Tom Padgett created a fictitious company, Interstate Appraisal Service, to defraud banks and other lending institutions out of millions of dollars. Tom Padgett, an insurance claims adjuster, conspired with Minkow to forge documents crediting ZZZZ Best for restoration work and use Interstate Appraisal Services as the source to verify the claims. Increasingly, investors and bankers developed an interest in ZZZZ Best based on fraudulent  financial statements  produced by Minkow’s firm. 2 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Barry Minkow claimed his fraudulent actions were driven by a need to repay organized crime. 
 
 
 
  As the Ponzi scheme continued, ZZZZ Best experienced significant  cash flow  problems. As a solution, Minkow planned to acquire KeyServ, Sears' authorized carpet cleaner, for $25 million. According to Minkow, the revenues from KeyServ would provide enough cash flow to end the Ponzi scheme. Before the deal was closed, the jilted homemaker sparked a campaign against ZZZZ Best that would expose more than the fraud committed against her. 4 
 
 
  The  L.A. Times  featured her story, which caused ZZZZ Best's stock price to decline sharply. Lenders began to call their loans and more investigations commenced, unraveling Minkow's dark web of deceit and fraud. Eventually, the truth behind the fictitious companies was revealed and the Ponzi scheme was exposed.
 
 
    How Auditors Were Misled    
  To launch an IPO, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires a firm to compile a  prospectus , which must include a set of audited financial statements. Independent  certified public accountant  (CPA) firm Ernst & Whinney (now Ernst & Young) audited ZZZZ Best's financials to provide an opinion as to whether the financial statements were free of material misstatement. 
 
 
  Assuming an independent third party provided the paperwork, the CPAs used false appraisal documents to perform its audit. When the CPA firm requested to visit a building refurbishing customer site, Minkow and his associates rented a building and created a bogus customer job site. 5 
 
 
    Minkow After ZZZZ Best    
  In January 1988, Minkow and 11 other company insiders were indicted by a grand jury on counts of racketeering, money laundering, securities fraud, embezzlement, mail fraud, bank fraud, and tax evasion. Separately, Minkow was also indicted on counts of credit card fraud. Approximately a year later, Minkow was found guilty on all charges, was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and was ordered to pay over $26 million in restitution. 5 
 
 
  After his early release in 1995, he became an ordained minister and served as a pastor of a church in California. Minkow informally investigated and reported other Ponzi schemes. From this success, he formed the fraudulent Fraud Discovery Institute. 4 
 
 
  In 2011, he was again convicted for fraud and sentenced to five years in prison. It was discovered that while filming and producing his biography, he simultaneously was using his anti-fraud company to short stocks of companies he was investigating. 6  A few years later","By

"Personal Financial Statement: Definition, Uses, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Personal Financial Statement?    
  A personal financial statement is a document that outlines an individual's financial position at a point in time based on their asset and liabilities. The statement typically includes general information about the individual such as their name and address along with a breakdown of their total  assets  and  liabilities .
 
 
  The statement can help individuals track their financial goals and wealth and it can be used when they apply for  credit .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A personal financial statement lists all assets and liabilities of an individual or couple. An individual's net worth is determined by subtracting their liabilities from their assets. A positive net worth shows more assets than liabilities. Net worth can fluctuate over time as the values of assets and liabilities change. Personal financial statements help track wealth and goals as well as applying for credit. Income and expenses may be included in a personal financial statement but they're generally placed on a separate sheet referred to as the personal income statement. 
 
    Understanding the Personal Financial Statement    
   Financial statements  can be prepared for either companies or individuals. An individual’s financial statement is referred to as a personal financial statement and is a simpler version of  corporate statements . Both are tools that can show the financial health of the subject.
 
 
  A personal financial statement shows the individual's  net worth : their assets minus their liabilities. Their net worth reflects what that person would have left in cash if they sold all their assets and paid off all their debts. The financial statement would indicate a negative net worth if their liabilities were greater than their assets. The individual would have a positive net worth if they had more assets than liabilities. 1 
 
 
  Keeping an updated personal financial statement allows an individual to track how their financial health improves or deteriorates over time. It can be a valuable tool when consumers want to change their financial situation or apply for credit such as a loan or a  mortgage . Knowing where they stand financially allows consumers to avoid unnecessary inquiries on their  credit reports  and the hassles of declined credit applications.
 
 
 
 
  The statement also allows credit officers to easily gain perspective into an applicant's financial situation to make an informed credit decision. The individual or couple may be asked to provide a personal guarantee for part of the loan in many cases or they may be required to put up  collateral  to secure the loan.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  A personal financial statement is broken down into assets and liabilities. Assets include the value of  securities  and funds held in  checking or savings accounts , retirement account balances,  trading accounts , and real estate. 2 
 
 
  Liabilities include any debts the individual may have including personal loans, credit cards, student loans, unpaid taxes, and mortgages. 3  Debts that are jointly owned are also included. Married couples can create joint personal financial statements by combining their assets and liabilities.
 
 
  Income and expenses are also included if the statement is used to obtain credit or to show someone's overall financial position. This can be tracked on a separate sheet or an addendum called the personal  income statement  that includes all forms of income and expenses, typically expressed in the form of monthly or yearly amounts.
 
 
  These items are not included in a personal financial statement:
 
 
 
 Business-related assets and liabilities:  These are excluded unless the individual is directly and personally responsible. The loan would be included in their personal financial statement if someone personally guarantees a loan for their business, similar to cosigning. 
 Rented items:  Anything that's rented isn't included in personal financial statements because the assets aren't owned. This changes if you own the property and rent it out to someone else. The value of the  property  is included in your asset list in this case. 
 Personal property:  Items such as furniture and household goods typically aren't included as assets on a  personal balance sheet  because these items can’t easily be sold to pay off a loan. Personal property with significant value such as jewelry and antiques may be included if their value can be verified with an  appraisal , however. 
 
 
   Important 
 Business liabilities are only included in a personal financial statement if an individual provides the creditor with a personal guarantee. 
 
 
 
  Your credit report and  credit history  are big considerations when it comes to getting new credit and every  lender  has different requirements for issuing credit. You may still be refused a loan or  credit card  if you haven't paid your previous debts on time or if you have too many inquiries on file e","By

How Is Economic Utility Measured?,"Definition 
 Utility is an economic term used to measure the value a good or service brings to a consumer. 
    What Is Utility?    
  Utility is the total satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service. Economic theories based on  rational choice  assume that consumers will strive to maximize their utility. The utility of a good or service directly influences an item's demand and its price. Economic models try to quantify or estimate utility to determine consumer decision-making.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Measuring utility helps explain how and why consumers make their decisions. ""Ordinal"" utility assumes one good is more useful or desirable than another. ""Cardinal"" utility measures economic value through imaginary units known as ""utils."" ""Marginal"" utility is what is gained by consuming an additional unit of a service or good. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Mira Norian 
 
    Utility Theory    
  The utility definition in  economics  relates to the concept of usefulness. An economic good yields utility to the extent to which it's useful for satisfying a consumer’s want or need. Various schools of thought differ as to how to model economic utility and measure the usefulness of a good or service.
 
 
  Early economists of the Spanish Scholastic tradition of the 1300s and 1400s described the economic value of goods as deriving directly from this property of usefulness and based their theories on prices and monetary exchanges. 1 
 
 
  Utility in economics was first coined by the noted 18th-century Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli. To  Bernoulli  and other economists, utility was modeled as a quantifiable or cardinal property of the economic goods that a person consumes. 2 
 
 
   Important 
 Economic utility can be estimated by observing a consumer's choice between similar products. However, measuring utility becomes challenging as more variables or differences are present between the choices. 3 
 
 
 
    Measuring Utility    
   Ordinal Utility : Economists of the  Austrian School  developed the ordinal theory of utility, the idea that individuals order or rank the usefulness of various units of economic goods. 4   Carl Menger  used this framework to resolve the  diamond-water paradox : the first available units of any economic good will be put to the most highly valued uses, and subsequent units go to lower-valued uses. The ordinal theory of utility explains the law of diminishing marginal utility and the fundamental  laws of supply and demand . 5  In ordinal utility terms, a person with three slices of pizza might eat the first, share the second slice with a friend, and waste the third.
 
 
 
 
   Cardinal Utility : Assumes a “util” represents the amount of satisfaction a specific good or service generates for a subset of people in various situations. The concept of a measurable ""util"" makes it possible to treat economic theory and relationships using mathematical symbols and calculations. However, “utils” cannot be observed, measured, or compared between different economic goods or between individuals. 3  For example, if economists determine that a piece of pizza yields 10 utils and a bowl of pasta yields 12 utils, individuals will know that eating the pasta will be more satisfying. Producers of pizza and pasta will then price pasta higher than pizza.
 
 
   Total Utility : If utility in economics is cardinal and measurable, the  total utility (TU)  is the sum of the satisfaction that a person receives from the consumption of all units of a specific product or service. Using the example above, if a person can only consume three slices of pizza and the first slice of pizza consumed yields ten utils, the second slice of pizza consumed yields eight utils, and the third slice yields two utils, the total utility of pizza would be twenty utils.
 
 
   Marginal Utility : This is defined as the additional (cardinal) utility gained from the consumption of one additional unit of a good or service or the additional (ordinal) use that a person has for an additional unit. Using the same example, if the economic utility of the first slice of pizza is ten utils and the utility of the second slice is eight utils, the  marginal utility (MU)  of eating the second slice is eight utils. If the utility of a third slice is two utils, the MU of eating that third slice is two utils.
 
 
   Why Is It Difficult to Accurately Measure Utility? 
 There is no direct way to measure the utility of a certain good for each consumer, but economists may estimate utility through indirect observation. For example, if a consumer is willing to spend $1 for a bottle of water but not $1.50, economists may surmise that a bottle of water has economic utility somewhere between $1 and $1.50. However, this becomes difficult in practice because of the number of variables in a typical consumer's choices.

"Budget Deficit: Causes, Effects, and Prevention Strategies","Definition 
 A budget deficit occurs when a government's expenses exceed its revenues. 
    What Is a Budget Deficit?    
  A budget deficit occurs when government expenses exceed  revenue . Many people use it as an indicator of the financial health of a country. It is a term more commonly used to refer to  government spending and receipts  rather than businesses or individuals.
 
 
  Budget deficits affect the  national debt , the sum of annual budget deficits, and the cumulative total a country owes to creditors. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A budget deficit occurs when expenses exceed revenue. Certain unanticipated events and policies may cause budget deficits. Countries can counter budget deficits by raising taxes or cutting spending. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Joules Garcia 
 
    Understanding Budget Deficits    
  When a budget deficit is identified, current expenses exceed the income received through standard operations. To correct its nation's budget deficit, often referred to as a  fiscal deficit , a government may cut back on certain expenditures or increase revenue-generating activities.
 
 
  A budget deficit can lead to higher levels of borrowing, higher interest payments, and low reinvestment, which will result in lower revenue during the following year.
 
 
  The opposite of a budget deficit is a  budget surplus.  When a surplus occurs, revenue exceeds current expenses, resulting in excess funds that can be further allocated. When the inflows equal the outflows, the budget is considered balanced.

  In the early 20th century, few industrialized countries had large fiscal deficits; however, during the First World War, deficits grew as governments borrowed heavily and depleted financial reserves to finance the war and their growth. These wartime and growth deficits continued until the 1960s and 1970s, when world economic growth rates dropped. 1 
 
 
 
 
    What Causes a Budget Deficit?    
  Both levels of taxation and spending affect a government's budget deficit. Common scenarios that create deficits by reducing revenue and increasing spending include:
 
 
   A tax structure that undertaxes high-wage earners but overtaxes low-wage earners. Increased spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare, or military spending. Increased government subsidies to targeted industries. Tax cuts that decrease revenue but provide corporations with funds to increase employment. Low GDP, or gross domestic product, results in lower tax revenue. 
 
 
  Budget deficits may occur as a way to respond to certain unanticipated events and policies, such as the increase in defense spending after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 2 
 
 
    Effects of a Budget Deficit    
  Budget deficits affect individuals, businesses, and the overall economy. As the government takes steps to improve the deficit, spending for programs such as Medicare or Social Security may be curtailed. Improvements to infrastructure may also be affected.
 
 
  To increase revenue, tax hikes may occur for high-income earners or large corporations, which may affect their ability to invest in new business ventures or hire new employees.
 
 
    Strategies Used to Reduce Budget Deficits    
  Countries counter budget deficits by  promoting economic growth through fiscal policies , such as reducing government spending and increasing taxes. Determining the best strategies regarding which spending to cut or whose taxes to raise are often widely debated.
 
 
  To pay for government programs while operating under a deficit, the federal government borrows money by selling U.S. Treasury bonds, bills, and other securities.
 
 
 
 
   What Is the Difference Between the Federal Budget Deficit and the Federal Government Debt? 
 A federal budget deficit occurs when government  spending outpaces revenue  or income from taxes, fees, and investments. Deficits add to the national debt or federal government debt. If government debt grows faster than gross domestic product (GDP), the debt-to-GDP ratio may balloon, possibly indicating a destabilizing economy. 3 
 
 
   When Was the Last Federal Budget Surplus? 
 The last time the U.S. government had a federal budget surplus was in 2001. In every year since there has been a federal budget deficit. 4 
 
 
   What Can the Government Do About a Budget Deficit? 
 The government can work to cut back the budget deficit by using its fiscal policy toolbox to promote economic growth, such as scaling back government spending and raising taxes. 
 
 
   What Causes a Budget Deficit to Improve?

 Definition 
 Business valuation is an analysis of a company's finances, assets, liabilities, and all other aspects to determine its economic value. 
    What Is a Business Valuation?    
  A business valuation is the process of determining the  economic value  of a business. It's also known as a company valuation. All business areas are analyzed during the valuation process to determine its worth and the value of its departments or units.
 
 
  A business valuation is often used during the process of negotiating the merger or acquisition of one company by another, but it might be used in other situations as well. Owners will often turn to professional business evaluators for an objective estimate of their business's value.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Business valuation determines the economic value of a business or business unit. Business valuation can be used to determine a business's fair value for various reasons, including sale value, establishing partner ownership, taxation, and even divorce proceedings. Business valuation methods include looking at market cap, earnings multipliers, or book value. The tools used for valuation can vary among evaluators, businesses, and industries.

    How Business Valuation Works    
  A business valuation is the process of determining the current worth of a business using objective measures. It evaluates all aspects of the business. Business valuation is typically conducted when a company is looking to sell all or a portion of its operations. It's also used during a merger or acquisition of one company by another, when establishing partner ownership, for taxation, and even as a part of divorce proceedings.

  The tools used for valuation vary among evaluators, businesses, and industries. Common approaches to business valuation include a review of financial statements and discounted cash flow models.
 
 
   Important 
 Estimating the fair value of a business is both an art and a science. Choosing the right method and appropriate inputs can be subjective or vary based on industry standards. Valuation can also involve intangible elements of a company's value, such as goodwill. 
 
 
 
    Methods of Valuation    
  A company can be valued in numerous ways. Each provides a different view of a company's value, and no method is inherently more correct than another.
 
 
    1. Market Capitalization    
   Market capitalization  is the simplest method of business valuation. It's calculated by multiplying the company's share price by its total number of shares outstanding.
 
 
  Microsoft Inc. traded at $438.24 on May 2, 2025. The company could then be valued at:
 
 
   $438.24 (Market Value) x 7.43 billion (Total shares Outstanding) = $3.26 trillion 1 2 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Market capitalization doesn't account for the debt a company owes that an acquiring company would have to pay off. It doesn't account for cash on hand that would offset that debt. You would have to calculate the company's  enterprise value  to determine these factors.

What Is Kuwaiti Currency? KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar) Definition and History,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)?    
  The Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) is the national currency of the State of Kuwait, which is located in the Middle East on the Arabian Peninsula right on the Persian Gulf. The dinar name derives from the Roman denarius. The KWD, which is the dinar’s  forex  acronym, subdivides into 1000 fils, which is a coin used in many Arab countries.
 
 
  Kuwait’s economy is heavily reliant on oil, making it one of the wealthiest nations in the world as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) is the currency of the State of Kuwait, and as of 2024 is one of the most valuable currencies on Earth. The currency fluctuates in a relatively small range and is pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies. The economy of Kuwait is heavily reliant on oil, making it one of the wealthiest nations in the world. Since its official release in 1961, the KWD has gone through six different versions. As of July 2024, one Kuwaiti dinar is equal to approximately $3.27 U.S. dollars. 3 
 
    Understanding the KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)    
  The introduction of the Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) in 1961 was a replacement for the Gulf rupee. The Gulf rupee was a currency pegged  at parity  to the Indian rupee. Issued in 1959 by the Indian government, the Gulf rupee was for use outside of India, particularly in the Persian Gulf region. Like the Indian rupee, the Gulf rupee was pegged to the  British pound sterling (GBP) . 4 
 
 
  In 1961, Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom with the end of treaties put in place after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire. 5 
 
 
  Kuwaiti Currency Law created the Kuwaiti Currency Board, which later became the Central Bank of Kuwait, with the purpose of establishing a Kuwaiti currency. The Central Bank of Kuwait introduced the Kuwaiti dinar as a replacement for the Gulf rupee. Until 1966, both currencies circulated, but the use of the rupee ended after its  devaluation . 6 7 
 
 
  From 1975 to 2003, the Kuwaiti dinar was  pegged  to a weighted currency basket. The content of the currency basket was mandated by the Central Bank of Kuwait. In 2003, the KWD was pegged to the  U.S. dollar (USD)  at 0.29963 dinars to the dollar. This valuation continued until 2007, when it was formally re-pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies. 8 
 
 
 
 
  As of July 2024, one Kuwaiti dinar is worth about $3.27, making it one of the most valuable currencies in the world. 9 3 
 
 
  The State of Kuwait has a petroleum product-based economy, with 90% of government revenues coming from the oil industry. The State of Kuwait is a tax-free country, with one of the  lowest unemployment rates  in the world. 10 11 12 
 
 
  The  Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA)  is the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world, and the investment industry of the country manages more assets than any other member of the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC), a regional economic and political union. 13 14 
 
 
    Issuance of the KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)    
  There have been six official issues of the Kuwaiti dinar banknotes since the first circulation in 1961. There have also been two commemorative sets circulated.
 
 
  The third series, released in 1980 upon the crowning of Emir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, was in use until Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Upon invasion, the Iraqi government installed the Iraqi dinar as the official currency for the area.
 
 
   $161.77 Billion 
 The GDP of Kuwait in 2023, which fell from to $182.81 billion in 2022. 15 
 
  The invading Iraqi forces stole an enormous number of Kuwaiti dinar banknotes. With the liberation of Kuwait, the invalidation of the third dinar issue forced the replacement of the fourth issue of the currency in 1991.
 
 
  The 1994 series implemented enhanced security features.
 
 
  The sixth series came in 2014 with bills specially textured so blind and vision-impaired people can identify them by touch.
 
 
    KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar) Exchange Rate    
  Between July 2014 and July 2024, the Kuwaiti dinar fluctuated between $3.17 and $3.54. That means that it costs between $3.17 and $3.54 to buy one Kuwaiti dinar. 16 
 
 
  The higher  rate , $3.54, means that the Kuwaiti dinar appreciated in value, or the U.S. dollar had fallen in value relative to the dinar. If the rate falls, that means that the Kuwaiti dinar is losing value, or that the U.S. dollar is gaining value relative to it.
 
 
  Due to its relatively low volatility, and limited global trade, the Kuwaiti dinar is not typically used as a speculative trading instrument. If it were, a trader would attempt to buy near the lower end of its historical range, and try to sell near the top of it. Buying at $3.17 and selling at $3.54—the price range over 10 years—represents an 11.67% profit, not including fees and commissions.

Zero-Based Budgeting: What It Is and How to Use It,"What Is Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB)?    
  Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a method of budgeting in which all  expenses  must be justified for each new period. The process begins from a “zero base” and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. The budgets are then built around what's needed for the upcoming period regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the last one.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Zero-based budgeting is a technique used by companies but this type of budgeting can be used by individuals and families as well. Budgets are created around the monetary needs for each upcoming period such as a month or a year. Traditional budgeting and zero-based budgeting are two methods used to track expenditures. Zero-based budgeting helps managers lower costs for a company. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Mira Norian / Investopedia 
 
    How Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Works    
  ZBB allows top-level strategic goals to be implemented into the budgeting process by tying them to specific functional areas of the organization. Costs can then be first grouped and then measured against previous results and current expectations.
 
 
  Zero-based budgeting can be a rolling process done over several years with a few functional areas reviewed by managers or group leaders at a time because of its detail-oriented nature. It can help lower costs by avoiding blanket increases or decreases to a prior period’s budget but it's a time-consuming process that takes much longer than traditional, cost-based budgeting. 1 
 
 
   Important 
 The practice favors areas that achieve direct revenues or production because their contributions are more easily justifiable than in departments such as client service and  research and development . 
 
 
 
  Zero-based budgeting is primarily used in business but it can be used by individuals and families, too.
 
 
 
 
    Zero-Based Budgeting vs. Traditional Budgeting    
  Traditional budgeting calls for incremental increases over previous budgets such as a 2% increase in spending. Zero-based budgeting requires a justification of both old and new expenses.

  Traditional budgeting also only analyzes new expenditures.  ZBB starts from zero  and calls for a justification of old, recurring expenses in addition to new expenditures. Zero-based budgeting aims to put the onus on managers to justify expenses. It drives value for an organization by  optimizing  costs, not just revenue.
 
 
    Example of Zero-Based Budgeting    
  Suppose a construction equipment company implements a zero-based budgeting process calling for closer scrutiny of manufacturing department expenses. The company notices that the cost of certain parts used in its final products and outsourced to another manufacturer increases by 5% every year.
 
 
  The company can manufacture those parts in-house using its workers. It finds after weighing the positives and negatives of in-house manufacturing that it can make the parts cheaper than the outside supplier.
 
 
  The company can identify a situation in which it can decide to make the part itself or buy the part from the external supplier for its end products instead of blindly increasing the budget by a certain percentage and masking the cost increase,
 
 
  Traditional budgeting may not allow  cost drivers  within departments to be identified but zero-based budgeting is a more granular process that aims to identify and justify expenditures. Zero-based budgeting is also more involved, however, so the costs of the process itself must be weighed against the savings it might identify.
 
 
   What Is Zero-Based Budgeting? 
 Zero-based budgeting was created in the late 1960s by former Texas Instruments account manager Peter Pyhrr. 2 Zero-based budgeting starts at zero, unlike traditional budgeting. It justifies each expense for a reporting period. Zero-based budgeting starts from scratch, analyzing each granular need of the company instead of using the incremental budgeting increases found in traditional budgeting. This essentially allows for a strategic, top-down approach to analyze the performance of a given project. 
 
 
   What Are the Advantages of Zero-Based Budgeting? 
 Zero-based budgeting offers several advantages, including focused operations, lower costs, budget flexibility, and strategic execution. The highest revenue-generating operations come into greater focus when managers think about how each dollar is spent. Lowered costs may result because zero-based budgeting may prevent the misallocation of resources that can happen over time when a budget grows incrementally. 
 
 
   What Are the Disadvantages of Zero-Based Budgeting?

 Definition 
 Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely stores records across a network of computers in a way that is transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. Each ""block"" contains data, and blocks are linked in a chronological ""chain."" 
    What Is a Blockchain?    
  A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—meaning it cannot  be altered.
 
 
  Since a block can’t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This reduces the need for trusted third parties, such as auditors or other humans, who add costs and can make mistakes.
 
 
  Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of  various cryptocurrencies ,  decentralized finance (DeFi)  applications,  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , and  smart contracts . 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use has been as a transaction ledger.  In Bitcoin’s case, the blockchain is decentralized, so no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu 
 
    How Does a Blockchain Work?    
   You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. The key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.
 
 
 
 
  A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: entering and accessing information, and  saving and storing it somewhere . A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.

  The Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a  block  (different blockchains have different size blocks). Once the block is full, the block data is run through a cryptographic hash function, which creates a hexadecimal number called the  block header  hash.
 
 
  The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name “blockchain.”
 
 
    Transaction Process    
  Transactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your  cryptocurrency wallet —the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.

"Demonetization: Meaning, Example, and How It Works","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Demonetization?    
  Demonetization is the act of stripping a  currency  unit of its status as  legal tender . It occurs whenever there is a change in  national currency . The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with a new currency.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Demonetization is a drastic intervention into the economy that involves removing the legal tender status of a currency. Demonetization can cause chaos or a serious downturn in an economy if it goes wrong. Demonetization has been used as a tool to stabilize the currency and fight inflation, facilitate trade and access to markets, and push informal economic activity into more transparency and away from black and gray markets. A famous example of demonetization occurred in 2016 when India demonetized 86% of its nation's currency. 1 Demonetized may also refer to social media or digital content that formerly qualified for revenue distribution but has since been denied income proceeds. 
 
    Understanding Demonetization    
  Removing the legal tender status of a unit of currency is a drastic intervention into an economy because it directly affects the medium of exchange used in all economic transactions. It can help stabilize existing problems, or it can cause chaos in an economy, especially if undertaken suddenly or without warning. That said, demonetization is undertaken by nations for a number of reasons.
 
 
  Demonetization has been used to stabilize the value of a currency or combat  inflation . The Coinage Act of 1873 demonetized  silver  as the legal tender of the United States, in favor of fully adopting the  gold standard , in order to stave off disruptive inflation as large new silver deposits were discovered in the American West. Several coins, including a two-cent piece, three-cent piece, and half-dime were discontinued.
 
 
  The withdrawal of silver from the economy resulted in a contraction of the  money supply , which contributed to a recession throughout the country. 2  In response to the recession and political pressure from farmers and from silver miners and refiners, the Bland-Allison Act remonetized silver as legal tender in 1878. 3 
 
 
 
 
  In a more modern example, the Zimbabwean government demonetized its dollar in 2015 as a way to combat the country’s hyperinflation. At its peak, Zimbabwe's hyperinflation reached month-over-month growth of 79.6 million percent growth and year-over-year growth of 89.7 sextillion percent. 4  The three-month process involved expunging the Zimbabwean dollar from the country’s financial system and solidifying the  U.S. dollar,  the  Botswana pula , and the  South African rand  as the country’s legal tender in a bid to stabilize the economy. 5 
 
 
  Some countries have demonetized currencies in order to facilitate trade or form currency unions. An example of demonetization for trade purposes occurred when the nations of the  European Union  officially began to use the  euro  as their everyday currencies in 2002. When the physical euro bills and coins were introduced, the old national currencies, such as the  German mark , the  French franc , and the Italian lira were demonetized. However, these varied currencies remained convertible into Euros at  fixed exchange rates  for a while to assure a smooth transition. 6 
 
 
   Important 
 The opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender. 
 
 
 
    Pros and Cons of Demonetization    
  There are several advantages when a nation demonetizes its currency. Fraudulent financial practices may be minimized as individuals will be unable to exchange illegal tender with banks. This also includes the potential reduction in tax evasion, pumping additional revenue into a nation's economy.
 
 
  Demonetizing physical paper tender also demonstrates an advancing banking system, as  digital currency  can be more accessible, safer to store, and easier to transfer ownership. Organized industries and companies often benefit the greatest due to an easier transition.
 
 
  Demonetization isn't without its faults. It's inconvenient for the nation's citizens and may be confusing when only select denominations are phased out over time. As a result of the disturbance, a nation's economy may temporarily experience a period of stalled growth in the short-term as the demonetization process occurs.
 
 
  There are costly logistical measures to be taken as well. ATMs and other means of disbursing cash must be modified and recoded. Consumer prices must be reframed to ensure proper change can be given if needed. Daily wage earners—often among the poorest with no to minimal  savings —may continue to be paid in defunct tender and must miss work to exchange their earnings with a bank.

Triple Bottom Line: What It Is and How to Measure,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The triple bottom line (TBL) concept states that company performance should be measured on social issues and environmental sustainability as much as on company profits. 
    What Is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)?    
  The concept of the triple bottom line (TBL) maintains that company performance should be measured equally on social issues, environmental goals, and corporate profits. TBL theory posits that instead of one bottom line, there should be three: profit, people, and the planet.
 
 
  TBL was developed in 1994 by John Elkington, a British management consultant and sustainability guru. The idea is that a company should be judged not only by how much money it makes but by whether it improves people's lives and the well-being of the planet. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The triple bottom line aims to measure the financial, social, and environmental performance of a company over time. Some performance measures include employee retention, increased external investments, and higher sales from customers committed to social and environmental goals. Some criticize TBL as difficult to measure, costly to implement, and conducive to competing strategies across its components. 
 
    Understanding the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)    
  In finance, when speaking of a company's  bottom line , we usually mean its profits. Elkington's TBL framework advances the goal of sustainability in business practices, in which companies look beyond profits to include social and environmental issues to measure the   full cost of doing business. Triple-bottom-line theory says that companies should focus as much attention on social and environmental issues as they do on financial issues.
 
 
  TBL theory also says that if a company focuses on finances only and does not   examine how it interacts socially, it is not able to see the whole picture and therefore cannot account for the full cost of doing business.
 
 
    The 3 Ps of the Triple Bottom Line    
  According to TBL theory, companies should be working simultaneously on these three bottom lines:

 Profit :   This is the traditional measure of corporate profit—the  profit and loss  (P&L) account. 
 People : This measures how socially responsible an organization has been throughout its history. 
 Planet :  This measures how environmentally responsible a firm has been. 2 
 
 
    Profit    
  In the context of the triple bottom line, profit can mean more than just how much money a company makes. A company must ensure it earns its income in ethical, fair manners. This includes soliciting business partners and vendors with which it aligns philanthropically. It also defines how a company develops its strategy or  financial operating plan . For instance, profit also ties to a company's responsibility to pay its lenders, creditors, and employees what is due to them and to have a sense of financial responsibility for these obligations.
 
 
  Some users of the triple bottom line may also say profit refers to not only a company's profit but the profit of those around the company. This specifically refers to the community in which the business operates. This may include:
 
 
 
 Ensuring the company is paying its fair share of local, state, or federal income taxes on a timely basis 
 Making sure the company is fostering economic wealth within its community by shopping local or utilizing small businesses. 
 Committing to financially investing in the community through partnerships, developments, or  corporate sponsorships . 
 
 
    People    
  In the context of triple bottom line, people refers to every individual that is in touch with a company. This includes but is not limited to:
 
 
   Employees.  This means ensuring workers receive a fair wage in a safe environment that encourages professional development.  Vendors.  This means ensuring a diverse set of suppliers are used and prioritizing small businesses or minority-owners when appropriate. Customers.  This means ensuring customers have fair access to products and their feedback regarding equity or safety are considered. 
 
 
  Traditionally, a company would prioritize investors or shareholders. Triple bottom line shifts the focus to individuals potentially not financially invested in the company but still tangentially involved with its operations. Now, instead of attempting to create value by only increasing investor returns, triple bottom line strives to create value by encouraging volunteerism of its employees or support or business success of small suppliers, for example.

3 Ways Robots Affect the Economy,"Close 
 
 
 
  Robots are increasingly being used in every industry and are here to stay, and robotics usage has both positive and negative impacts on business and employees. The following are a variety of ways that robots affect the economy.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Robots encroach on manufacturing work and now make literal inroads into tasks like driving, logistics, and inventory management. While there may be a negative effect on some labor segments, robots and automation increase productivity, lower production costs, and can create new jobs in the tech sector. Increasing use of robots leads to increased productivity, which can lead to an increase in gross domestic product.  
 
    The Rise of the Machines    
  Technology has played a role in making work more efficient for thousands of years, from simple farming tools to current-day assembly-line robots in factories. Robots are becoming present in more and more situations in business. They work right alongside human workers or completely replace them. For example, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:  AMZN ) uses a variety of robots in its warehouses to stock  inventory , and retrieve and package items. 1  Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:  TSLA ) boasts robotic and automated assembly lines for its electric cars and batteries. Robots are even being used in therapy sessions for children. 2  While it is certainly true that robots are replacing jobs and are a significant threat to low-skilled workers and somewhat of a threat to middle-skilled workers, there are many positive effects that robots have on the economy. 3 
 
 
    Productivity Growth    
  Higher living standards can come about through higher wages, lower pricing of goods and services, and an overall greater variety of products and services. Labor productivity growth, as measured as output per hour, is what leads these things to occur. 4  Growth results from one or a mixture of three things: increases in the quality of labor, increases in  capital  and total factory productivity (TFP), also known as multi-factor productivity. 5 
 
 
  Increases in the quality of labor come from more and better education and training of employees. Capital drives productivity growth via investments in machines, computers, robotics and other items that produce output. TFP, often cited as the most important source of productivity growth, comes from the synergies of labor and capital working together as efficiently as possible. 6  As an example, keeping the education and productivity of the workforce constant, if the machines they use increase in productivity, the TFP still rises. Robots are unquestionably making the ""machine"" aspect of production facilities more efficient. Even if the human component of factories remains constant, increased efficiencies from robotics inevitably leads to more productivity growth.
 
 
 
 
    Gross Domestic Product Growth    
  Not surprisingly, with increased  productivity  comes an increase in gross domestic product (GDP). In December 2018, a paper by Georg Graetz of Uppsala University and Guy Michaels of the London School of Economics titled ""Robots at Work"" studied the effects of robots in the economy. They looked at the United States and 16 other countries, and analyzed a variety of data for a 15-year period ending in 2007. Graetz and Michaels found that, on average, across the 17 countries, the increasing use of industrial robots over the time period raised the annual growth of GDP by 0.36%. They compared this substantial growth to the boosts in productivity that occurred at the turn of the 20th century from steam technology. 7 
 
 
    Job Creation    
  Many people fail to realize that robots are actually creating new, high-paying jobs that require skilled workers. While it is true that robots are replacing low-skilled workers and automating the tasks that they perform, robots and automation are requiring jobs that focus workers on higher-value work. For example, in manufacturing, robots can perform menial tasks such as raw materials sorting, transporting and stocking, while higher-skilled roles such as quality-related tasks, which humans are more suitable for, can be completed by higher-skilled workers.
 
 
  While it is true that robots and automation are taking away entire categories of jobs across a multitude of  industries , it has never been a better time for workers to get higher-skilled, higher-paying jobs as long as they become skilled and educated enough themselves to fill those roles.

What Does 1%/10 Net 30 Mean in a Bill’s Payment Terms?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The 1%/10 net 30 payment term offers a 1% discount to payees if they're willing to pay an invoice within the first 10 days of a 30-day payment period. 
    What Is 1%/10 Net 30?    
  1%/10 net 30 is a payment term used to incentivize a payor to pay an invoice early to capture a  cash discount  on purchases. This means that if the bill is paid within 10 days, a 1% discount will be applied to the purchase price. Otherwise, the full total amount is due within 30 days.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A 1%/10 net 30 deal contains two payment terms: a potential price discount for early payment and more general payment due terms.  1%/10 means a payee can take a 1% discount on services or products as long as they are paid within 10 days. At the same time, the payee must make payment on the invoice within 30 days, regardless whether they opt to make early payment or not.  The cost of credit is used as a percentage and occurs when the buyer does not take the reduced cost, thus paying the higher cost, reflecting the discount loss. A vendor may offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash, which is especially important for businesses with no revolving lines of credit. 
 
    Understanding 1%/10 Net 30    
  The 1%/10 net 30 calculation represents the  credit  terms and payment requirements outlined by a seller. The  vendor  may offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash. This is particularly important for cash-strapped businesses or companies with no revolving  lines of credit . Companies with higher  profit margins  are more likely to offer cash discounts.
 
 
  Although the numbers are always interchangeable across vendors, the standard structure for offering a payment discount is the same. The first number will always be the percentage discount. This figure will indicate the total percentage discount on the invoice prior to shipping or taxes that may be discounted upon early payment.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Discount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtual  short-term loans . This is because if the discount is not taken, the buyer must pay the higher price as opposed to paying a reduced cost. In effect, the difference between these two prices reflects the discount lost, which can be reported as a percentage. This percentage is called the cost of credit.
 
 
 
 
  When the credit terms are 1%/10 net 30, the net result becomes, in essence, an  interest  charge of 18.2% upon the failure to take the discount.

   Fast Fact 
 Companies with higher profit margins are more likely to offer cash discounts. 
 
 
 
  The  accounting  entry for a cash discount taken may be performed in two ways.
 
 
  The gross method of purchase discounts assumes the discount will not be taken and will only input the discount upon actual receipt of payment within the discount period. Therefore, the entire amount of receivable will be  debited . When payment is received, the receivable will be credited in the amount of the payment and the difference will be a credit to discounts taken.
 
 
  The alternative method is called the net method. For a discount of 1%/10 net 30, it is assumed that the 1% discount will be taken. This results in a receivable being debited for 99% of the total cost.
 
 
    Example of 1%/10 Net 30    
  For example, if “$1,000 - 1%/10 net 30” is written on a bill, the buyer can take a 1% discount ($1,000 × 0.01 = $10) and make a payment of $990 within 10 days, or pay the entire $1,000 within 30 days.
 
 
   Important 
 If the invoice is not paid within the discount period, no price reduction occurs, and the invoice must be paid within the stipulated number of days before  late fees  may be assessed. 
 
 
 
  The second number is always the number of days of the  discount period . In the example above, the discount period is 10 days. Finally, the third number always reflects the invoice due date.
 
 
   What Does 1%/10 Net 30 Represent? 
 The 1%/10 net 30 calculation represents the credit terms and payment requirements outlined by a seller. The vendor may offer incentives to pay early to  accelerate the inflow of cash . 
 
 
   Is 1%/10 Net 30 a Loan? 
 Yes. Discount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtual short-term loans. If the discount is not taken, the buyer must then pay the higher price as opposed to paying a reduced cost. 
 
 
   What Do the Numbers in a 1%/10 Net 30-type Calculation Stand for? 
 The first number is always the percentage of the discount. The second number is always the number of days of the discount period. The third number always reflects the invoice due date.

 Calculating net operating income (NOI) helps measure the profitability of an income-producing property. 
    What Is Net Operating Income (NOI)?    
  Net operating income (NOI) shows the profitability of income-generating real estate investments. NOI includes all  revenue  from the property, minus necessary  operating expenses . However, NOI is a before-income-tax figure on a property’s income and cash flow statement, excluding principal and interest payments on loans, capital expenditures, depreciation, and  amortization .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Net operating income (NOI) measures an income-producing property’s profitability. To calculate NOI, subtract all operating expenses incurred on a property from all revenue generated. NOI helps a property owner determine if renting a property is worth the expense of owning and maintaining it.

    What NOI Tells Real Estate Investors    
  NOI looks at the total revenue vs. the total operating expenses of a rental property. Revenue is income from rent, parking or storage fees, and on-site vending machines or laundry services. Operating expenses include maintenance and repairs,  property taxes  and insurance, property management fees, janitorial services, and utilities.  Capital expenditures , such as costs for a new air conditioning system for the entire building, are not included in NOI.
 
 
  NOI is used to calculate the  capitalization rate , a measure of an investment property's profitability relative to its total cost. The cap rate is calculated by dividing the NOI by the property's total cost. Expressed as a percentage, the capitalization rate helps investors compare the returns of different properties.
 
 
  For financed properties, NOI is also used in the  debt coverage ratio (DCR) , which tells lenders and investors whether a property’s income covers its operating expenses and debt payments. NOI is also used to calculate the net income multiplier, cash return on investment, and total return on investment.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 A property's capitalization rate is also known as  return on investment (ROI)  in real estate. 
 
 
 
    Formula and Example    
   Net operating income = R R − O E where: R R = real estate revenue O E = operating expenses \begin{aligned} &\text{Net operating income} = RR - OE \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &RR=\text{real estate revenue}\\ &OE=\text{operating expenses}\\ \end{aligned} ​ Net operating income = R R − O E where: R R = real estate revenue O E = operating expenses ​

   The net operating income (NOI) is $26,000 - $10,000 = $16,000. 
 
 
    Profit and Loss    
  An owner who collects $120,000 in revenues and incurs $80,000 in operating expenses will have a resulting NOI of $40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000). If the total is negative, with higher costs than revenues, the result is called a  net operating loss (NOL) .

"FANG Stocks: Definition, Companies, Performance, and How to Invest","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 FANG is an acronym of four technology companies: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. 
    What Are FANG Stocks?    
  In finance, the acronym ""FANG"" refers to the stocks of four prominent American  technology companies : Meta ( META ) ( formerly Facebook ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ), and Alphabet/Google ( GOOG ). FANG stocks are famous for the impressive growth they have experienced.
 
 
  In 2017, the company Apple ( AAPL ) was also added by some analysts, resulting in the new acronym "" FAANG ."" Apple's stock price more than doubled between June 2020 and June 2025. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The acronym ""FANG"" refers to the stocks of four popular American technology companies: Facebook (Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (Alphabet). Since 2017, Apple has also been included, making the acronym FAANG. Each FANG company has shown extraordinary growth, reflected in their revenues and net profits. Although their business models vary, they each share the use of advanced technologies to acquire and retain users. 
 
    Understanding FANG Stocks    
  The term ""FANG stocks"" was initially coined by  The Street's  Bob Lang and later popularized by Jim Cramer on his CNBC TV show  Mad Money . 2  It is now widely used by market commentators and analysts. The stocks referred to by the acronym are all well-known and richly valued technology companies that trade on the  Nasdaq  exchange, a collection of approximately 4,000 American companies. 3  Many other companies traded on the Nasdaq exchange are also considered  growth investments , although very few have matched the impressive growth of the FANG stocks.
 
 
  Despite their common reputation as successful growth companies, the business models of the FANG stocks are distinct.
 
 
    Facebook (Meta)    
  Facebook, for example, is the world's preeminent  social networking  platform. In the company's March 2025 quarterly reporting, Meta claimed it's daily active users for March 2025 was 3.43 billion, up 6% from the year prior. 4  To monetize this extraordinary user base, Facebook sells ads targeted based on users' personal preferences and usage patterns.
 
 
 
 
    Amazon    
  Amazon, meanwhile, is a leading  business-to-consumer  (B2C) e-commerce platform that uses leading-edge  cloud computing  and  data analytics  technologies to sell a retail catalog. Although Amazon initially pioneered the sale of books online, books now represent much less of its overall product catalog than when it started. 5 
 
 
    Netflix    
  Netflix is also known for its impressive customer growth. An online entertainment  streaming service  specializing in movies and television shows, the company's subscriber base has grown exponentially, from 26 million in 2011 to 302 million reporting in the company's 2024 annual report. 6 7  To compete with  new entrants  to the streaming market, Netflix also aggressively produces exclusive content, moving beyond its traditional role as a content aggregator to a major content producer in its own right.
 
 
    Google (Alphabet)    
  Alphabet has leveraged its core expertise as the world’s foremost search engine, developing a highly profitable online advertising business while driving user retention through popular web applications such as YouTube, Google Docs, and Google Maps.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 There are alternative acronyms for clusters of stocks; for example, FAANG incorporates Apple stock. 
 
 
 
    FANG Stock Performance    
    Meta    
  Over the past decade, Meta Platforms has delivered remarkable long-term returns, with its stock price climbing nearly 700% since mid-2015 and over 1,700% since its 2012 IPO. 8  The company experienced significant volatility: after a sharp drop of -64% in 2022, Meta rebounded with a 194% surge in 2023 and a further 66% gain in 2024. As of June 16, 2025, Meta is up a little more than 17% YTD.
 
 
    Apple    
  Apple’s stock has been a consistent long-term winner, rising from under $20 in 2014 to a peak closing price of $258.40 in December 2024—a more than tenfold increase over the decade. 9  The company saw particularly strong gains in 2020 and 2021, with annual returns of 82% and 35% respectively. In 2025, Apple’s shares have faced headwinds, declining about 20% year-to-date as of June 16, 2025 amid a broader concerns about demand and potential tariff implications.
 
 
    Amazon    
  Amazon’s stock has delivered extraordinary long-term gains, rising roughly 900% over the past decade. The company’s shares soared during the pandemic, then endured a steep drop in 2022 (-50%) before rebounding 81% in 2023 and 44% in 2024.

"What Is a Leveraged Loan? How Financing Works, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A leveraged loan is a type of loan made for borrowers who already have high levels of debt or a low credit score. These loans are considered high-risk and therefore have higher interest rates. 
    What Is a Leveraged Loan?    
  A leveraged loan is a type of loan offered to companies or individuals that already have considerable amounts of debt or a poor credit history. Lenders consider leveraged  loans  to carry a higher risk of default, and as a result, a leveraged loan is more costly to the borrower.
 
 
  Leveraged loans for companies or individuals with debt tend to have higher interest rates than typical loans. These rates reflect the higher level of  risk  involved in issuing the loans.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Leveraged loans are extended to borrowers with considerable amounts of debt and/or poor credit history. 
 Lenders  consider leveraged loans to carry a higher risk of  default , and as a result, are more costly to the borrowers. 
 Leveraged loans have higher interest rates than typical loans, which reflect the increased risk involved in issuing the loans. 
 
 
    Understanding Leveraged Loans    
  A leveraged loan is structured, arranged, and administered by at least one commercial or investment bank. These institutions are called arrangers and subsequently may sell the loan, in a process known as  syndication , to other banks or investors to lower the risk to lending institutions. 1 
 
 
  There are no set rules or criteria for defining a leveraged loan. Some market participants base it on a spread. For instance, many of the loans pay a  floating rate , often based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which replaced the  London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)  in June 2023, or another benchmark, plus a stated basis or  ARM margin .  In general, the adjustment of the credit spread adds basis points to the interest rate on a loan to make up for the fact that SOFR has traded below LIBOR. 2 
 
 
  If the ARM margin is above a certain level, it is considered a leveraged loan. Others base the classification on the borrower's credit rating, with loans rated below  investment grade , which is categorized as Ba3, BB-, or lower by the rating agencies  Moody’s  and  S&P Global Ratings .
 
 
 
 
  Typically, banks are allowed to change the terms when syndicating the loan, which is called price flex. The ARM margin can be raised if demand for the loan is insufficient at the original interest level in what is referred to as upward flex. Conversely, the spread over SOFR can be lowered, which is called reverse flex, if demand for the loan is high.
 
 
    How Do Businesses Use Leveraged Loans?    
  Companies typically use a leveraged loan to finance  mergers and acquisitions  (M&A), recapitalize the balance sheet, refinance debt, or for general corporate purposes.
 
 
  M&A could take the form of a  leveraged buyout  (LBO). An LBO occurs when a company or private equity company purchases a public entity and takes it private. Typically, debt is used to finance a portion of the purchase price. A recapitalization of the balance sheet occurs when a company uses the capital markets to change the composition of its capital structure. A common transaction in this process issues debt to buy back stock or pay a  dividend , which are cash rewards paid to shareholders.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Leveraged loans allow companies or individuals that have high debt or poor credit history to borrow cash, though at higher interest rates than usual. 
 
 
 
    Example of a Leveraged Loan    
   Credit rating agencies  like Moody's or S&P Global Ratings typically identify loans as leveraged if they are rated below instrument grade. Moody's defines leveraged debts as those rated Ba3 or lower, while S&P categorizes leveraged loans as those rated BB- or lower. 3 
 
 
   What Is a Leveraged Loan? 
 A leveraged loan is a type of loan made to borrowers with high levels of debt or a low credit rating. Lenders consider leveraged loans to carry a higher-than-average risk that the borrower will be unable to pay back the loan (also known as the risk of default). These loans generally earn higher interest rates for lenders because of the higher level of risk. 1 
 
 
   What Is the Difference Between a Bank Loan and a Leveraged Loan? 
 Leveraged loans—also known as floating-rate loans or bank loans—are loans made by banks or other financial institutions that are then sold to investors. Companies may use the money they get to refinance their debt, fund mergers and acquisitions, or finance projects. The companies that receive these loans typically have credit ratings that are below investment grade. They are secured by collateral such as the borrower's real estate and equipment, or by  intellectual property  including brands, trademarks, and customer lists. 4

 Form W-2 reflects the annual income an employer paid an employee and the taxes it withheld for the tax year. 
    What Is Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement?    
  Form W-2, also known as the Wage and Tax Statement, is a document an employer sends to each employee and files with the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the end of January following the tax year. The IRS gets a copy.
 
 
  Form W-2 shows the wages paid by an employer and the amount of income withheld from employee paychecks for income taxes, Social Security taxes, and Medicare taxes.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Form W-2 is an IRS tax form that details the income an individual has been paid during the year and the income for taxes that has been withheld and sent to the government. Employers send W-2s to their employees annually for tax purposes. They use W-2s to report income taxes and FICA taxes withheld on behalf of employees. The IRS uses W-2 forms to track individuals' tax obligations. 
 
    Who Files Form W-2?    
  An employer must send out a W-2 form to every employee to whom they paid a salary, wage, or other form of compensation. This does not include contracted or self-employed workers, who file taxes with different forms.
 
 
  The employer must send the employee the W-2 form on or before Jan. 31 each year so that the employee has the information they need to file an income tax return before the deadline, commonly April 15. 1 2 
 
 
  Employers use W-2 forms to report the income withheld for  Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)  taxes and income taxes.
 
 
  By the end of January, employers must file Form W-2 with the SSA, along with Form W-3, for each employee.
 
 
  The SSA uses the information on these forms to calculate the Social Security benefits that each worker is entitled to. 3 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Tax documents reflect earnings and deductions for the previous year. A W-2 form sent to an employee in January 2025 showed wages paid in 2024. 
 
 
 
    Information Included on a W-2    
  Taxpayers will receive multiple W-2s if they work for more than one employer.
 
 
  Taxpayers input the data found on the W-2 into a  Form 1040  individual tax return, either by hand or electronically. Regardless of the employer or company, every W-2 provides the same information: 2

"Uniform Distribution: Definition, How It Works, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A uniform distribution is a probability distribution where each outcome in a range has an equal chance of occurring. 
    What Is a Uniform Distribution?    
  In  statistics , probability distributions can help you decide the probability of a future event—that is, the likelihood of something happening. A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution where the probability remains constant across the entire range of possible values (i.e., all outcomes are equally likely).
 
 
  A deck of cards is expected to have a uniform distribution because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution expectation because the odds of getting either heads or tails are the same.
 
 
  A uniform distribution can be visualized as a straight horizontal line. For a coin flip, heads or tails each has a probability of occurring 50% of the time (p = 0.50), so it would be plotted on a chart with a line from the y-axis at 0.50.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 In a uniform distribution, all possible outcomes are equally probable. In a discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have the same likelihood. In a continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite. In a normal distribution, data around the mean (average) occur more frequently than occurrences farther from it. Uniform distributions can be plotted on charts. 
 
    Understanding Uniform Distributions    
  There are two types of uniform distributions:  discrete  and continuous.
 
 
    Discrete Uniform Distributions    
  The possible results of rolling a die provide an example of a discrete uniform distribution. It is possible to roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but it is not possible to roll, for example, a 2.3, 4.7, or 5.5. Therefore, the roll of a die generates a discrete distribution with the probability of 1/6 for each outcome. There are only six possible values to return and nothing in between. The possibilities are finite.
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The term “discrete” in statistics refers to variables with singular, countable, and limited possible values. 
 
 
 
    Continuous Uniform Distributions    
  Continuous uniform distributions have infinite distribution possibilities. An idealized random number generator would be considered a continuous uniform distribution. With this type of distribution, every point in the continuous range between 0.0 and 1.0 has an equal opportunity of appearing, yet there is an infinite number of points between 0.0 and 1.0.
 
 
  There are several other important continuous distributions, such as the  normal distribution ,  chi-square , and Student’s  t-distribution .
 
 
    Distribution Analysis    
  There are also several data-generating or data-analyzing functions associated with distributions that help explain the variables and their  variance  within a dataset. These functions include  probability density function , cumulative density, and moment generating functions.
 
 
    Visualizing Uniform Distributions    
  A distribution is a simple way to visualize a dataset. It can be shown either as a graph or a list, and reveals which values of a random variable have lower or higher chances of happening.
 
 
  In a uniform distribution, each value in the set of possible values has the same possibility of happening. When displayed as a  bar  or  line graph , this distribution has the same height for each potential outcome. In this way, it can look like a  rectangle  and therefore is sometimes described as the rectangular distribution.
 
 
  If you think about the possibility of drawing a particular suit from a deck of playing cards, there is a random yet equal chance of pulling a heart as there is for pulling a spade—that is, ¼ or 25%. (There are four suits.)
 
 
  The roll of a die yields one of six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Because there are only 6 possible outcomes, the probability of you landing on any one of them is 16.67% (1/6). When plotted on a graph, the distribution is represented as a horizontal line, with each possible outcome captured on the x-axis, at the fixed point of probability along the y-axis.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Uniform distribution of one six-sided die. 
 Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2020 
 
    Example of a Uniform Distribution    
  There are 52 cards in a traditional deck of cards. Also in that deck are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains an ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, jack, queen, and a king. The deck contains two jokers as well. However, we’ll ignore the jokers and face cards for this example, and focus only on number cards replicated in each suit. As a result, we are left with 40 cards, a set of discrete data.
 
 
  Suppose you want to know the probability of pulling a two of hearts from the modified deck. The probability of pulling a two of hearts is 1/40 or 2.5%. Each card is unique. Therefore, the l","By

5 Key Investment Strategies To Learn Before Trading,"Close 
 
 
 
  An investment strategy is a set of principles that guides your portfolio decisions. With seemingly countless theories and approaches on offer, from simplistic learn-this-one-trick TikToks to dense tomes seemingly only for financial doctorates, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about where to start.
 
 
  But don't worry: successful investing doesn't require a finance degree, complicated math skills, or a TikTok account. By focusing on a few key investment strategies, even beginning traders can lay a solid foundation for long-term success in the market. The truth is many successful investors use straightforward strategies that anyone can learn. These time-tested approaches help you  make smarter choices about where to put your money  and how to manage risk—kind of like having guardrails on a set of stairs.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Before choosing a stock market strategy, thoroughly assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. This self-review should be the basis of any approach you take. Passive index investing involves putting your money into index-tracking mutual or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering built-in diversification and a hands-off approach. Investors who follow growth strategies should review the executive teams of the firms they're investing in and news about the economy and relevant sectors. Momentum investors buy stocks trending upward and short-sell them since they view them as likely to come back down to earth. Dollar-cost averaging removes the pressure of trying to time the market perfectly. It's a disciplined approach that involves investing consistently over time, regardless of market shifts. 
 
    Getting Started    
  Before choosing  an investment strategy , it's important to gather some basic information about your finances. Let's get you started with these important strategic questions:
 
 
    Strategic Question 1: How Are Your Finances?    
  Even though you don't need much money to start, you shouldn't begin investing until you can afford to do so. If you have  debts  or other obligations, consider the impact investing will have on your short-term cash flow before you start putting money into your portfolio.
 
 
 
 
  Most advisors recommend paying down your debts and having a three-to-six-month emergency fund before socking away significant amounts in an investment portfolio. As you build toward getting ready to trade, you should sort out how much you can afford to put into your stock market account.
 
 
    Strategic Question 2: What Are Your Financial Goals?    
  Next, set out your objectives. Everyone has different needs, so you should determine yours. Are you saving for retirement? Are you looking to make major purchases like a home or car? Are you saving for your or your children's education?
 
 
  Answering these questions will help you narrow down a strategy since each approach requires different levels of liquidity, opportunities, and risk.
 
 
   Important 
 Ensure you can afford to invest before you start putting money away. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt, for example, before setting money aside for the future. 
 
 
 
    Strategic Question 3: What Is Your Risk Tolerance?    
  Next, figure out your  risk tolerance . Financial advisors typically have a set of questions to determine their clients. Some are quantitative: your age, income, and how long you have until retirement. Younger investors have time on their side to recuperate losses, so it's often recommended that younger investors hold more risk than those who are older.
 
 
  However, some questions to determine your risk tolerance are qualitative and personal.
 
 
  ""Psychological components play a large factor in clients’ tolerance toward risk,"" said Nate Creviston, manager of wealth management and portfolio analysis at Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio. ""Simply put, some are more comfortable taking risks if they know that mathematically, over long periods, they will outperform others who aren’t comfortable taking on risks. However, risk-averse clients aren’t wrong. They deserve to have a portfolio tailored to their comfortability and goals.""
 
 
 
 
  People who grew up in the same home and have very similar experiences and income can have very different reactions to specific financial situations. How would you feel if your investments dropped 30% overnight? How would you react if your portfolio is worth $1,000 less today than yesterday? Sometimes, the best strategy for making money could make you deeply uncomfortable. Your investment strategy will need to align with where your comfort level ultimately is.
 
 
    Strategic Question 4: Can You Handle Market Volatility?    
  Relatedly, you'll need to handle the ups and downs of the market. Alyson Claire Basso, a managing principal of Hayden Wealth Management in Middleton, Massachusetts, told us she makes it a point ""to discuss past market experiences and potential future market volatility.","By

What Is Online Banking? Definition and How It Works,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Online Banking?    
  Online banking lets you manage your finances anywhere you have a computer or laptop and an internet connection. What you can do online depends on how robust your bank's digital banking platform is. Generally, you can complete basic banking activities like viewing recent transactions and transferring money between accounts. 
 
 
  While you can also do many of the same banking activities at a physical, brick-and-mortar bank branch, online banking is a convenient alternative for most transactions.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Online banking lets you complete financial transactions on the internet instead of at a bank or credit union. It’s faster, more convenient, and available 24/7. 
 Online banking is done from a desktop or laptop, while  mobile banking  takes place on portable electronic devices like smartphones and tablets.  
 Online-only banks are gaining popularity for their comprehensive digital features and better interest rates on deposit accounts. But you may need to visit a  brick-and-mortar bank or credit union  once in a blue moon. 
 
 
    How Does Online Banking Work?    
  Online banking lets you make financial transactions from a web browser instead of trudging to the nearest bank. Mobile banking is similar, but it’s digital banking designed for portable electronics with smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets. 
 
 
  You can access your bank’s online banking system by going to your bank’s website and logging in to your account. Mobile banking is accessible through your bank’s app or mobile-friendly web browser. Brick-and-mortar banks, online-only banks, credit unions, and neobanks all have online banking options. 
 
 
   Tip 
 Also called  fintech banks , neobanks aren’t actually banks. Instead, financial technology companies partner with banks to provide alternative money management solutions. Partner banks are often FDIC-insured, so your money is protected up to $250,000. However, always check if the partner bank is an FDIC member to make sure.  
 
 
 
  Pre-internet, you had to go to the bank during business hours to do almost any banking activity. Even withdrawing money was a hassle, since ATMs only came on the scene in the 1960s. 1  Today, you can easily conduct banking activities 24/7 from anywhere with an internet connection. At home, work, school, or on the street, you can access your bank account through an array of electronic devices.

    What You Can Do With Online Banking    
  Here are the types of  things you can do with online banking :
 
 
    Payments and Transfers    
 
 Transfer money  to internal or external bank accounts 
 Send domestic or international wire transfers 
 Send money to others via Zelle or other payment platforms 
 Pay bills 
 Schedule future payments for people and bills 
 
 
    Manage Finances    
   Check account balances View transaction history Download account statements Set up account alerts for balances falling below a dollar value or purchases over a certain amount 
 
 
   Warning 
 Be sure to use a secure internet connection to access your account. Logging in while on public wifi or an unsecured network could reveal private information to hackers. 
 
 
 
    Manage Your Debit Card and Account    
   Freeze or lock your card Request a card replacement Update your address Monitor and manage fraud alerts Notify your bank of travel dates 
 
 
    Saving and Budgeting    
   Open new accounts Set up savings goals Use budgeting tools Analyze your spending 
 
 
    Manage Credit and Loans    
   Make and track payments and balances Track your credit score, if credit monitoring is included 
 
 
  Even if you mostly do online banking, it can be a good idea to maintain a bank account at a brick-and-mortar financial institution. You may find yourself needing to visit a branch for things like:
 
 
   Getting a cashier’s check quickly for a used car down payment. Completing a wire transfer for a home down payment because it exceeds your account's online daily wire transfer limit. Depositing a check that wasn’t accepted for mobile banking. 
 
 
   Tip 
 Digital check deposits are generally only available with mobile banking. Business checking accounts may have  remote deposit capture , sometimes for an added fee.  
 
 
 
    Pros and Cons of Online Banking    
  Online banking is embraced by many people because of how convenient it usually is, even if it lacks some features, like cash deposits. You also tend to get the best interest rates for deposit accounts ( checking ,  savings ,  certificates of deposit ) with  online-only banks  and credit unions, so online banking can help you grow your m","By

"What Is a Loan Commitment? Definition, How It Works, and Types","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A loan commitment is an agreement from a financial institution to lend a specified amount of money to a borrower, which can be either secured by collateral or unsecured. 
    What Is a Loan Commitment?    
  A loan commitment is an agreement by a commercial bank or other financial institution to lend a business or individual a specified sum of money. A loan commitment is useful for consumers looking to buy a home or a business planning to make a major purchase.
 
 
  The loan can take the form of a single lump sum or—in the case of an open-end loan commitment—a  line of credit  that the borrower can draw upon as needed (up to a predetermined limit).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A loan commitment is an agreement by a commercial bank or other financial institution to lend a business or individual a specified sum of money. Loan commitments are useful for consumers looking to buy a home or businesses planning to make a major purchase. The loan can take the form of a single lump sum or a line of credit that the borrower can draw upon as needed (up to a predetermined limit). Loan commitments can be either secured or unsecured; a secured commitment is typically based on the borrower’s creditworthiness and has some form of collateral backing it. whereas an unsecured commitment is solely based on the borrower's creditworthiness (it has no collateral backing it). 
 
    Understanding a Loan Commitment    
  Financial institutions make loan commitments based on the borrower’s  creditworthiness  and—in if it's a secured commitment—on the value of some form of collateral. In the case of individual consumers, this collateral may be a home. Borrowers can then use the funds made available under the loan commitment, up to the agreed-upon limit. An open-end loan commitment works like a revolving line of credit: When the borrower pays back a portion of the loan's  principal , the lender adds that amount back to the available loan limit.
 
 
   Important 
 Interest rates when obtaining a secured loan commitment may be lower, but this type of loan requires putting up collateral; if you can't repay the loan, you may risk losing the collateral. 
 
 
 
    Types of Loan Commitments    
  Loan commitments can be either secured or unsecured.
 
 
 
 
    Secured Loan Commitment    
  A secured commitment is typically based on the borrower’s creditworthiness and it has some form of collateral backing it. Two examples of open-end secured loan commitments for consumers are a  secured credit card –where money in a bank account serves as collateral–and a  home equity line of credit (HELOC) –in which the equity in a home is used as collateral.
 
 
  Because the credit limit is typically based on the value of the secured asset, the credit limit is often higher for a secured loan commitment than for an unsecured loan commitment. In addition, the loan’s interest rate may be lower and the payback time may be longer for a secured loan commitment than for an unsecured one. However, the approval process typically requires more paperwork and takes longer than with an unsecured loan.
 
 
  The lender holds the collateral’s deed or title–or places a  lien  on the asset–until the loan is completely paid. Defaulting on a secured loan may result in the lender assuming ownership of and selling the secured asset, at which point they would then be responsible for using the proceeds to cover the loan.
 
 
    Unsecured Loan Commitment    
  A loan that doesn't have any collateral backing it is primarily based on the borrower’s creditworthiness. An unsecured credit card is one very basic example of an unsecured open-end loan commitment. Typically, the higher the borrower’s  credit score , the higher the credit limit.
 
 
  However, the interest rate may be higher than on a secured loan commitment because no collateral is backing the debt. Unsecured loans typically have a fixed minimum payment schedule and interest rate. The process for acquiring this type of loan often takes less paperwork and approval time than a secured loan commitment.
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of Loan Commitments    
  Open-end loan commitments are flexible and can be useful for paying unexpected  short-term debt  obligations or covering financial emergencies. In addition, HELOCs typically have low interest rates, which may make their payments more affordable. Secured credit cards can help consumers establish or rebuild their credit; paying their bill on time and keeping total credit card debt low will improve their credit scores, and in time they may be eligible for an unsecured credit card.
 
 
  The downside of a secured loan commitment is that borrowers who take out too much money and are unable to repay the loan may have to forfeit their collateral. For example, this could mean losing their home. Unsecured commitments have a higher interest rate, which makes borrowing more expensive.

Ex-Dividend: Meaning and Date,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The ex-dividend date is the deadline for investors to own a stock to receive a declared dividend. 
    What Is Ex-Dividend?    
  A dividend is a cash payment to shareholders as a reward for investing in company stock or  equity  shares. Ex-dividend means a company's dividend allocations have been specified. The ex-dividend date or ""ex-date"" is usually one business day before the record date.
 
 
  Investors who purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after will not receive the next  dividend  payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. Investors only get dividends if they buy the stock before the ex-dividend date.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Ex-dividend means a company's dividend allocations have been specified. The ex-dividend date is when the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value. Investors who purchase stock before the ex-dividend date are entitled to the next dividend payment, while those who purchase stock on or after the ex-dividend date are not. 
 
    Ex-Dividend Date    
  A stock trades ex-dividend on and after the ex-dividend date or  ex-date . Investors who buy a stock on the ex-dividend date or after will not receive the next dividend payment. Since buyers aren't entitled to the next dividend payment on the ex-date, the stock will be priced lower by the amount of the dividend by the exchange. 1 
 
 
   Tip 
 Some  broker platforms might use an XD suffix  to the stock's ticker to indicate it is trading ex-dividend. 
 
 
 
    Declaring Dividends    
  When a company declares a dividend, its board of directors establishes a record date when investors must be on record as shareholders to receive the dividend payment. Once the record date is set, the ex-dividend date is also determined according to the exchange rules on which the stock is traded.
 
 
 
 
  The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date. For example, if a company declares a dividend on March 3 with a record date of Monday, April 11, the ex-dividend date would be Friday, April 8, because it’s one business day before the record date. 1  The ex-dividend date is before the record date because of how stock trades are settled.

  After a stock trade, the transaction isn't settled for one business day, known as the "" T+1 "" settlement. Investors with stock on Thursday, April 7 that is sold on Friday, April 8 would still be the  shareholder of record  on Monday, April 11, because the trade hasn't settled. However, if the stock sold on Wednesday, April 6, the trade would be settled on Thursday, April 7, before the ex-dividend date of Friday, April 8, and the new buyer would be entitled to the dividend.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang. 
 
    Stock Price and Ex-Dividend    
  On average, a stock price will drop slightly less than the dividend amount. Given that stock prices move daily, the fluctuation caused by small dividends may be difficult to detect. The effect on stocks from larger dividend payments can be easier to observe.
 
 
  If a company issues a dividend in stock instead of cash or the  cash dividend  is 25% or more of the value of the stock, the ex-dividend date rules differ. With a stock or large cash dividend, the ex-dividend date is set on the first business day after the dividend is paid. 1 
 
 
   Important 
 Stock trades do not actually  settle  until the day after a transaction. 
 
 
 
    Key Dividend-Related Dates    
   Declaration date:  This is the date when a company's board of directors announces the dividend distribution. Any change in the expected dividend can cause the stock to rise or fall quickly as traders adjust their expectations. The ex-date and record date will occur after the declaration date. Record date:  This is when the company reviews who the shareholders of record are. The record date is one business day after the ex-date. Payment date:  Dividend checks are sent or credited to investor accounts. 
 
 
    Explain Like I'm Five    
  A dividend is when a company distributes part of its earnings to shareholders. Dividends are announced well in advance, and some investors buy stocks specifically to collect the dividend.
 
 
  You must own a stock before the ex-dividend date to qualify for a dividend, meaning that you must buy it the day before or earlier. Investors who buy shares on or after the ex-date will not receive the dividend.
 
 
   What Is an Example of a Dividend Payment? 
 Suppose Company XYZ pays a $0.53 per share dividend on June 2, 2024. The payment goes to shareholders who had purchased stock before the ex-date of May 5, 2024. The company declared the dividend on Feb. 19, 2024, and the re","By

 The quick ratio evaluates a company's ability to meet its current obligations using its most liquid assets. 
    What Is the Quick Ratio?    
  The quick ratio measures a company’s ability to immediately meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets. The quick ratio is used to evaluate the strength of a company's cash position.
 
 
  The quick ratio is sometimes called the  acid test ratio .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The quick ratio measures a company’s capacity to pay its current liabilities without borrowing money. The quick ratio is considered a more conservative measure than the current ratio, which includes all current assets as coverage for current liabilities. The quick ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s most liquid assets like cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivables by its total current liabilities. The higher the ratio, the better a company’s financial health; the lower the ratio, the more likely the company will struggle with paying debts. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   The ideal quick ratio is 1 or higher, although it can vary by industry. 
 Madelyn Goodnight / Investopedia 
 
    Formula for the Quick Ratio    
  There are a few different ways to calculate the quick ratio. The most common approach is to add the most liquid assets and divide the total by current liabilities: 
 Quick Ratio = “Quick Assets” Current Liabilities \begin{aligned}&\textbf{Quick Ratio}\mathbf{=}\frac{\textbf{``Quick Assets''}}{\textbf{Current Liabilities}}\end{aligned}  ​ Quick Ratio = Current Liabilities “Quick Assets” ​ ​ 
 Quick assets are defined as the most liquid current assets that can easily be exchanged for cash. For most companies, quick assets are limited to just a few types of assets: 
 Quick Assets = Cash + CE + MS + NAR where: CE = Cash equivalents MS = Marketable securities NAR = Net accounts receivable \begin{aligned}&\textbf{Quick Assets}\mathbf{=}\textbf{Cash}\mathbf{+}\textbf{CE}\mathbf{+}\textbf{MS}\mathbf{+}\textbf{NAR}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{CE}=\text{Cash equivalents}\\&\text{MS}=\text{Marketable securities}\\&\text{NAR}=\text{Net accounts receivable}\end{aligned} ​ Quick Assets = Cash + CE + MS + NAR where: CE = Cash equivalents MS = Marketable securities NAR = Net accounts receivable ​ 
 Depending on what type of current assets a company has on its balance sheet, a company may also calculate quick assets by deducting illiquid current assets from its  balance sheet . For example, consider that inventory and prepaid expenses may not be easily or quickly converted to cash; a company may calculate quick assets as follows: 
 Quick Assets = TCA − Inventory − PE where: TCA = Total current assets PE = Prepaid expenses \begin{aligned}&\textbf{Quick Assets}\mathbf{=}\textbf{TCA}\mathbf{-}\textbf{Inventory}\mathbf{-}\textbf{PE}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\textbf{TCA}=\text{Total current assets}\\&\textbf{PE}=\text{Prepaid expenses}\end{aligned} ​ Quick Assets = TCA − Inventory − PE where: TCA = Total current assets PE = Prepaid expenses ​ 
 
 
 Regardless of which method is used to calculate quick assets, the calculation for current liabilities is the same, as all current liabilities are included in the formula.

  The quick ratio measures the dollar amount of liquid assets available against the dollar amount of current liabilities of a company.

"TSA PreCheck: What It Is, What It Does, Benefits, and How to Qualify","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 TSA PreCheck is an airport security screening program in the United States that allows approved travelers to pass through dedicated security lines without having to remove laptops, liquids, and shoes. 
    What Is TSA PreCheck?    
  TSA PreCheck is a U.S. government program that allows travelers deemed low risk to pass through an expedited security screening process at more than 200 U.S. airports.
 
 
  TSA PreCheck benefits for air  travelers  include faster access to airline boarding gates and an absence of the usual requirements to scan your laptop and jacket. You can even keep your shoes on through security.
 
 
  About 99% of TSA PreCheck passengers wait less than 10 minutes to pass through security. There are 20 million active members in the PreCheck program, according to the latest report. The application process includes applying through the  TSA website  and attending a brief in-person meeting. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 TSA PreCheck benefits include an expedited security screening process at most U.S. airports, skipping the usual screening of personal items like laptops and shoes. TSA PreCheck is managed by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is charged with airport safety. Travelers obtain TSA PreCheck status by applying through the TSA website and attending a brief meeting with a TSA “enrollment provider.” Applicants are fingerprinted and must show identification and citizenship or residency documents. TSA PreCheck status costs $78 and is good for five years. 
 
    How TSA PreCheck Works    
  TSA PreCheck  travelers often have  dedicated lines at the security checkpoint. They don’t have to remove belts, shoes, or lightweight jackets for separate screening. Their carry-on items are not separately screened, either. They can leave a laptop in its case, and the carry-on bag can include a quart-sized bag with travel-size containers of liquids and gels. 3 
 
 
 
 
  The TSA PreCheck program began in December 2013 to speed prescreened travelers through security checkpoints, which get backed up during busy times. 4

  The usual process includes a requirement that  passengers  remove their shoes, heavy jackets, and some electronics and pile them into trays for separate screening. Further delays can be caused by passengers being pulled aside for additional scrutiny if the screening reveals banned items.
 
 
  These measures aren’t pointless. A would-be terrorist smuggled explosives in his sneakers on a Paris-to-Miami flight in 2001. Dangerous or illegal items can be hidden inside laptops that have had their components removed. Bulky jackets can hide weapons. 5 
 
 
  The TSA PreCheck program identifies passengers who are at very low risk of trying any of these strategies and speeds them through the security checkpoints.
 
 
   Important 
 The cost of becoming a traveler with TSA PreCheck status is $78. The fee is nonrefundable and good for five years. 6 
 
 
 
    Benefits of TSA PreCheck    
  The TSA PreCheck program benefits anyone who travels frequently for business or leisure reasons. Anyone forced to fly at peak times like holiday weekends will also appreciate the break.
 
 
   TSA PreCheck benefits  include:
 
 
   An effective prescreening process that allows you to prove once and for all that you’re a law-abiding citizen and you’re not up to no good A quicker trip through the security checkpoint at the airport The chance to skip the minor annoyance of piling your laptop, shoes, and coat in a bin for separate screening A dedicated line for people with TSA PreCheck status 
 
 
  In short, you’ll spend less time standing in line and more time lounging in the airport cafe. 
 
 
    Applying for TSA PreCheck    
  More than 200 airports and 90+ airlines accommodate TSA PreCheck travelers. You can begin the application process online via the TSA’s website. 7 
 
 
  However, you have to complete the application process in person at a TSA-authorized enrollment location. You will be fingerprinted and asked for a valid proof of identity and U.S. citizenship documents. Travelers who are foreign citizens must be able to provide certain residency documents to qualify.
 
 
  The online application takes less than five minutes, on average, and the in-person appointment takes about 10 minutes. 1 
 
 
  Once approved for TSA PreCheck status, you will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN). Use that number anytime you book a flight, and you will automatically have your TSA PreCheck status applied to your boarding pass. 3 
 
 
  Then you can start using those fast lanes reserved for TSA PreCheck passengers.

 Definition 
 Economic growth occurs in response to a rise in the production of capital goods, technology, or human capital and it generally corresponds with a rise in national income. 
    What Is Economic Growth?    
  Economic growth is an increase in the production of economic goods and services in one period compared to a previous period. It can be measured in nominal or real terms. Aggregate economic growth is traditionally measured in terms of  gross national product (GNP)  or  gross domestic product (GDP)  but alternative metrics are sometimes used.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Economic growth is an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy. Increases in capital goods, labor force, technology, and human capital can all contribute to economic growth. Tax cuts are generally less effective in spurring economic growth than increases in government spending. Economic growth is commonly measured in terms of the increase in aggregate market value of additional goods and services produced using estimates such as GDP.

    How Economic Growth Works    
  Economic growth refers to an increase in aggregate production in an  economy  which generally manifests as a rise in national income.
 
 
  Aggregate gains in production often but do not necessarily correlate with increased average  marginal productivity . This leads to an increase in incomes, inspiring consumers to open up their wallets and buy more and driving a higher material quality of life and standard of living.
 
 
  Growth in economics is commonly modeled as a function of  physical capital , human capital, labor force, and technology. Increasing the quantity or quality of the working-age population, the tools they have to work with, and the recipes they have available to combine labor, capital, and raw materials will lead to increased economic output.

   Expansion : Employment, income, industrial production, and sales all increase during this phase, and there's a rising real GDP. Peak : This is when an economic expansion hits its ceiling. It's effectively a turning point. Contraction : The elements of an expansion all begin to decrease during this phase. It becomes a recession when a significant decline in economic activity spreads across the economy. Trough : This is when an economic contraction hits its nadir. 
 
 
  A single business cycle is dated from peak to peak or trough to trough. Cycles generally aren't regular in length and there can be a period of contraction during an expansion or vice versa.
 
 
  The U.S. economy has experienced more expansions than contractions since World War II. The average expansion lasted about 65 months from 1945 to 2019. The average contraction was only 11 months. The Great Recession lasted for 18 months, however, from December 2007 to June 2009. This was followed by the longest expansion on record of 128 months, lasting until 2020 and the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1

 Definition 
 The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a calculation of a company’s total liabilities and shareholder equity that evaluates its reliance on debt. 
    What Is the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio?    
  The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. It's calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance because it's a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources.
 
 
  The debt-to-equity ratio is a type of gearing ratio.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company's total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt. D/E ratios vary by industry and are best used to compare direct competitors or to measure changes in a company's reliance on debt over time. A higher D/E ratio among similar companies suggests more risk. A particularly low ratio may indicate that a business isn't taking advantage of debt financing to expand. Investors will often modify the D/E ratio to consider only long-term debt because it carries more risk than short-term obligations. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Katie Kerpel 
 
    Calculating the D/E Ratio    
   Debt/Equity = Total Liabilities Total Shareholders’ Equity \begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Liabilities} }{ \text{Total Shareholders' Equity} } \\ \end{aligned} ​ Debt/Equity = Total Shareholders’ Equity Total Liabilities ​ ​ 
 The necessary information to calculate the D/E ratio can be found on a company's balance sheet. Subtracting the value of liabilities from total assets provides the figure for  shareholder equity . 
 These balance sheet categories may include items that wouldn't normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. The ratio can be distorted by  retained earnings  or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, so further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt. 
 Analysts and investors will often modify the D/E ratio to get a clearer picture and facilitate comparisons. They also assess the D/E ratio in the context of short-term  leverage ratios , profitability, and growth expectations.

  Your other option is to manually enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, such as in B2 and B3, and then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.
 
 
    What Does the D/E Ratio Tell You?    
  The D/E ratio measures how much debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities. Debt must be repaid or refinanced, and it imposes interest expenses that typically can’t be deferred. This can impair or destroy the value of equity in the event of a default.

What Is the Harmonic Mean?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The harmonic mean is a way to average a series of financial ratios. 
    What Is the Harmonic Mean?    
  The harmonic mean is an average that's very useful when used to average multiples like the price-to-earnings ratio.
 
 
  It is calculated by dividing the number of values in a series by the total of the reciprocals of each number. Thus, the harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals. 
 It is used in finance to average data like price multiples. 
 The harmonic mean weights each value in a series equally, while the weighted harmonic mean assigns different weights according to a value's importance. 
 The harmonic mean is also used by market technicians to identify patterns such as  Fibonacci sequences . 
 
 
    Formula and Calculation    
  To calculate a harmonic mean, take the reciprocal of each number in a series. Add them up. Then divide the number of values in the series by that total. 
 So for instance, to calculate the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4, take the reciprocal of each number. Total those. Next, divide the number of values by that total, as follows:  
 3 ( 1 1   +   1 4   +   1 4 )   =   3 1 . 5   =   2 \frac{3}{\left(\frac{1}{1}\ +\ \frac{1}{4}\ +\ \frac{1}{4}\right)}\ =\ \frac{3}{1.5}\ =\ 2 ( 1 1 ​   +   4 1 ​   +   4 1 ​ ) 3 ​   =   1 . 5 3 ​   =   2 
 The harmonic mean of 1,4, and 4 is 2.
 
 
   Important 
 The reciprocal of a number n is simply 1 / n. 
 
 
 
    Using the Harmonic Mean    
  The harmonic mean has uses in finance and the technical analysis of securities markets. It helps to find multiplicative or divisor relationships between fractions without worrying about common denominators. 
 The harmonic mean is used as well when averaging rates such as the average travel speed over several trips. 
 In particular, the harmonic mean is used to average multiples (like the  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio ) because it gives equal weight to each data point. It's felt that the result is less biased and more accurate because of the equal treatment. 
 There is also a weighted harmonic mean, which weights certain values more heavily than others if they are known to have greater importance. 
 The weighted harmonic mean of x1, x2, x3 with the corresponding weights w1, w2, w3 is given as: 
 ∑ i = 1 n w i ∑ i = 1 n w i x i \displaystyle{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}w_i}{\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{w_i}{x_i}}} ∑ i = 1 n ​ x i ​ w i ​ ​ ∑ i = 1 n ​ w i ​ ​ 
 
 
 
 
    Arithmetic Mean and Geometric Mean    
  Three types of means, the harmonic,  arithmetic , and geometric, are known as the Pythagorean means. The distinctions between the three types of Pythagorean means make them suitable for different uses.
 
 
  An arithmetic average is the sum of a series of numbers divided by the count of that series of numbers.
 
 
  To find the class (arithmetic) average of test scores, simply add up all the test scores of the students, and then divide that sum by the number of students.
 
 
  A weighted  arithmetic mean  gives greater weight to high data points than low data points (e.g., in finance, because P/E ratios aren't price-normalized while the earnings are equalized).
 
 
  The  geometric mean  is the average of a set of products, the calculation of which is commonly used to determine the performance results of an investment or  portfolio .
 
 
  It is technically defined as ""the  nth  root product of  n  numbers."" The geometric mean must be used when working with  percentages , which are derived from values, while the standard arithmetic mean works with the values themselves.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The harmonic mean is best used for fractions such as rates or multiples. 
 
 
 
    Example of the Harmonic Mean    
  One company has a  market capitalization  of $100 billion and earnings of $4 billion (P/E of 25), and another company has a market capitalization of $1 billion and earnings of $4 million (P/E of 250). 
 Say that you want to find out the average P/E ratio for an index made up of those two stocks. With 10% invested in the first company and 90% invested in the second, you'd use the weighted harmonic mean formula for your computation. 
 Let's also compare the weighted harmonic mean to the weighted arithmetic mean to see how they're different. 
 The average P/E ratio of the index is:  
 Using the WAM: P/E   =   0 . 1 × 2 5 + 0 . 9 × 2 5 0   =   2 2 7 . 5 Using the WHM: P/E   =   0 . 1   +   0 . 9 0 . 1 2 5   +   0 . 9 2 5 0   ≈   1 3 1 . 6 where: WAM = weighted arithmetic mean P/E = price-to-earnings ratio WHM = weighted harmonic mean \begin{aligned}&\text{Using the WAM:\ P/E}\ =\ 0.1 \times25+0.9\times250\ =\ 227.5\\\\&\text{Using the WHM:\ P/E}\ =\ \frac{0.1\ +\ 0.9}{\frac{0.1}{25}\ +\ \frac{0.9}{250}}\ \approx\ 131.6\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{WAM}=\text{weighted arithmetic mean}\\&\text{P/E}=\text{price-to-earnings ratio}\\&\text{WHM}=\text{weighted har","By

Generation X (Gen X): Between Baby Boomers and Millennials,"What Is Generation X (Gen X)?    
  Generation X, sometimes shortened to Gen X, is the name given to the generation of people born between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s.
 
 
  The exact years that comprise Gen X vary. Some researchers—demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe, for example—place the exact birth years from 1961 to 1981, whereas Gallup places the birth years between 1965 and 1979. But all agree that Gen X follows the baby boomer generation and precedes Generation Y, also known as the millennial generation. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Generation X, or Gen X, refers to the generation of people born between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s. Gen X-ers, falling between baby boomers and millennials, number around 65 million. Some members of this group are in the middle of their working careers and potential peak-earning years, while the oldest are approaching retirement age. The generation is on track to become the first generation to be worse off in terms of being prepared for retirement than their parents. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Sydney Burns. 
 
    Understanding Generation X    
  The name ""Generation X"" comes from a novel by Douglas Coupland, ""Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture"", published in 1991. Though it's more useful for marketing than sociology, generational theory—the assumption that people born within the same time frame can be considered a group with similar views, values, tastes, and habits—and the idea of a  generation gap  have gained broad acceptance in the U.S. 3 4 
 
 
  The generations covered in the theory are:
 
 
 
 Greatest Generation  (born circa 1922 to 1927) 
 Silent Generation (circa 1928 to 1945) 
 Baby Boomers  (circa 1946 to 1964) 
 Generation X (circa 1965 to 1980) 
 Millennial  Generation (circa 1981 to 1996) 
 Generation Z  (circa 1997 to 2012) 
 Generation Alpha  (circa 2013 to 2022) 5 6

  Gen X numbers around 65 million, while the baby boomers have around 69 million members and millennials number around 72 million, as of the latest data from 2022. Gen X is also sometimes referred to as the “latchkey generation” as they were often left unsupervised at home after school until their parents came home from work. 5 7 
 
 
  Like the silent generation, Generation X has been defined as an ""in-between"" generation. The group's earning power and savings were compromised first by the  dotcom bust , and then by the  financial crisis of 2008  and the  Great Recession . In terms of social and political power, Generation X is sandwiched between the baby boomers, who came of age during the Vietnam and Reagan eras, and the millennials of the Obama era.
 
 
   Important 
 Gen X overlaps with another group called the  sandwich generation . Each modern generation has gotten its time in this slot, which is used to characterize middle-aged individuals who—due to longer life spans and having children later in life—find themselves supporting both aging parents and growing children simultaneously. 
 
 
 
    Gen X vs. Baby Boomers and Millennials    
  The 23rd Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, published in 2023, compares  Gen X, baby boomers, and millennials . 8  Among its findings:
 
 
   12% of baby boomers have taken a loan or early withdrawal from a retirement account, compared with 19% of Gen X savers and 24% of millennials. Baby boomers had an estimated median retirement savings per household of $289,000, compared with $82,000 for Gen X and $49,000 for millennials. Among those offered a 401(k) or similar plan, 85% of baby boomers saved for retirement, while 81% of Gen X and 78% of millennials did. 
 
 
    Gen X's Financial Situation    
  Over the next two decades, there will be a major transfer of wealth—collectively, around $84 trillion—from baby boomers to younger generations including their Gen X children. And they're  going to need it . 9 
 
 
  Gen X accounts for just 25.6% of the nation’s wealth, while baby boomers hold just over half (51.6%), according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. 10 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Notable members of Generation X include Jeff Bezos, Tiger Woods, and the late Kurt Cobain. 
 
 
 
    Retirement Savings    
  Thirty-one percent of Gen X members have at least $250,000 in household retirement savings, while 26% have between $50,000 and $250,000. By comparison, 51% of baby boomers have $250,000 or more saved for retirement. Nine percent of Gen X members have no money saved for retirement at all. 8

"Government Shutdown: Definition, Example, Impact on Economy","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Government Shutdown?    
  A government shutdown occurs when nonessential U.S. government offices can no longer remain open due to a lack of funding. The lack of funding usually occurs when the approval of the federal budget that will finance the government for the upcoming fiscal year is delayed. The shutdown remains in effect until funding legislation is passed.
 
 
  During a government shutdown, many federally run operations will halt. Some organizations may still stay open by running on  cash reserves , but once these funds run out, they will also close.
 
 
  While shutdowns can also occur within the state, territorial, and local levels of government, the term ""government shutdown"" is usually used to refer to the federal government.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A government shutdown occurs when there is a failure to pass the necessary funding legislation that will finance the government for its next fiscal year. During a government shutdown, nonessential government offices are unable to remain open; some essential workers must continue to work but their pay may be furloughed. Veterans' benefits and unemployment payments continue to be paid. Long government shutdowns impact the entire American economy. 
 
    What Happens During a Government Shutdown?    
  During a government shutdown, the U.S. federal government is required to reduce agency activities and services and cease any non-essential operations (including furloughing non-essential workers).
 
 
    Essential Agencies Remain Open    
  Some agencies remain open during a government shutdown. These services are those that, if suspended, would endanger the health, life, or personal safety of the public. Essential employees in departments covering the safety of human life or protection of property also remain employed. However, these employees may not earn a paycheck during the time of the government shutdown unless a specific spending bill is passed to fund those work hours. 1 
 
 
  Essential employees include those working in the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In addition, Both the Federal Reserve and the Postal Service will both continue their operations because neither receive federal funds. 2 3 
 
 
 
 
    Veteran and Unemployment Benefits Continue    
  During a government shutdown, the disbursement of payments from government sources to citizens for veterans’ benefits or unemployment insurance will continue. These programs receive money from specially earmarked budgets and funds from advanced Congressional  appropriations . Furloughed federal employees may also apply for temporary unemployment, but the processing of claims may be prolonged. 4 5 
 
 
    Impacts are Widespread    
  Government shutdowns can affect many government processing functions. Nonessential agencies who cannot self-fund through the collection of fees or other  revenue  sources may be forced to  furlough , or give unpaid leave, to their employees. Most of the public will see the effect of the government shutdown in the lessening of services they may expect or receive. Perhaps the most visual of these closings is in the shutting down of national parks and monuments. 
 
 
  The real effects of a government shutdown are widespread. It may take longer or be impossible to process new loans for homes, businesses, and education. New applications for Social Security benefits and the processing of unemployment insurance will also slow. 
 
 
  There are various other impacts of a government shutdown. This includes the delay or halting of the United States Department of Agriculture's inspection of some food products; the  Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)  may be prevented from recalling unsafe products; travelers may be unable to receive new passports (which are issued by the U.S. Department of State). 6 7 8  In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be unable to identify and track outbreaks of illness. 9 
 
 
  If the government shutdown remains in place long enough, more agencies will close or reduce the services they provide to the public as a whole, and a larger portion of the American population will begin to see the direct effects.
 
 
    Government Shutdown Effects on the Economy    
  As government operations slow or stop altogether, the effects may also spread to businesses in the  private sector . It's possible that the entire economy may lose money as a result of this disruption in government operations. However, the overall cost and lasting impact of a government shutdown on the economy may vary. For example, the government shutdown of 2013, which lasted for 16 days, was estimated to have cost the U.S. economy $24 billion. 10 11 
 
 
  Furloughed federal employees may individually curtail their spending. Collectively, this can have an impact on local businesses—for example, if","By

 An umbrella insurance policy is a type of personal liability coverage that goes beyond the amount that regular homeowners or vehicle insurance offers. To own umbrella insurance, you must own a standard homeowners, auto, or watercraft policy; the umbrella policy kicks in after the regular coverage has been exhausted. Candidates for umbrella insurance include people who possess considerable assets or potentially hazardous items or engage in activities that could increase their risk of being sued. 
 
    How an Umbrella Insurance Policy Works    
  The added coverage provided by an umbrella insurance policy is most useful to high-net-worth individuals who own a significant amount of assets—or very expensive assets—and are at risk of being sued. Small businesses may also use an umbrella insurance policy to guard against potential monetary damages arising from claims.
 
 
  The premium for an umbrella insurance policy may be less expensive if it is purchased from the same insurer that provided the original auto, homeowners, or watercraft insurance. Depending on the provider, the policyholder who wants to add an umbrella insurance policy must have a base insurance coverage of $150,000 to $250,000 for  auto insurance  and $250,000 to $300,000 for  homeowners insurance .
 
 
  Umbrella insurance is often referred to as excess liability insurance. If a policyholder is sued for damages that exceed the liability limits of car insurance, homeowners insurance, or other coverage types, an umbrella policy helps pay what they owe. In other words, if the dollar limit of the original policy has been exhausted, the umbrella policy acts as a fail-safe, so the insured person doesn't have to dip into savings and other assets. 1 
 
 
   Important 
 Umbrella insurance may also provide coverage not included in a basic insurance policy, such as libel, slander, and false imprisonment. 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  People who purchase umbrella insurance may own expensive property or have significant savings. Those who own dangerous items that can cause injury, such as swimming pools, trampolines, or dogs, might also buy an umbrella insurance policy.
 
 
 
 
  If you have a mortgage loan, homeowners insurance is required by mortgage lenders. However, if you have high-risk items on your property, an umbrella policy can provide additional liability coverage that exceeds that homeowners policy.
 
 
  People who engage in activities that increase their chances of lawsuits may also purchase umbrella insurance. Those activities might include:
 
 
   Being a landlord Coaching kids’ sports Serving on the board of a nonprofit Volunteering Regularly posting reviews of products and businesses Participating in sports where you could easily injure others, such as skiing, surfing, or hunting 
 
 
   $200 to $300 
 The annual cost of a $1 million personal umbrella insurance policy 2 
 
    Example of an Umbrella Insurance Policy    
  To understand how umbrella insurance can help, consider the following scenario: A driver runs a red light and accidentally hits another car, causing significant damage to the vehicle and injuring several people.
 
 
  With car repairs totaling $50,000 and the treatment of the injuries eclipsing $500,000, the driver at fault may be liable for expenses that go far beyond the coverage limits of their insurance.  An umbrella insurance policy  will pick up the additional liability costs beyond the limits of their car insurance coverage.
 
 
   Why Would Someone Need an Umbrella Insurance Policy? 
 An umbrella policy is helpful if someone is injured on your property or you injure someone while using one of your possessions, such as your car, boat, or automobile. If you're sued and found liable, the umbrella policy can cover the financial compensation to the injured party, protecting your assets. 
 
 
   What Is Not Covered by an Umbrella Policy? 
 An umbrella policy provides liability protection, which helps cover the cost of damage to another person's property or if they're injured, but it does not cover your possessions, such as your home or automobile. 
 
 
   Do Retirees Need an Umbrella Insurance Policy? 
 If you have built up a substantial amount of assets and are at risk of being sued due to high-risk items or activities, such as having a swimming pool or boat or being a landlord, you might consider an umbrella policy to provide additional liability protection.

What Is a Z-Test?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A Z-test is a hypothesis test that helps an investor gauge the average daily return of a stock. 
    What Is a Z-Test?    
  A Z-test compares one mean against a hypothesized value. It tests whether two means are the same. The data must approximately fit a  normal distribution , or the test won't work. Parameters such as variance and standard deviation should be calculated when performing a Z-test.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A Z-test is a hypothesis test for data that follows a normal distribution.  A Z-statistic, or Z-score, represents the result from the Z-test. Z-tests are closely related to T-tests, but T-tests are best performed when an experiment has a small sample size. Z-tests assume the standard deviation is known, while T-tests assume it is unknown. 
 
    Hypothesis Testing    
  The Z-test is also a hypothesis test in which the Z-statistic follows a normal distribution. The Z-test is best used for greater-than-30 samples because, per the  central limit theorem , the samples are considered to be approximately normally distributed with larger samples. For a Z-test to be effective, the population must be normally distributed, and the samples must have the same variance. All data points should be independent of one another. 1 
 
 
  When conducting a Z-test, the null and alternative hypotheses and alpha level should be stated. The  Z-score  should be calculated, and the results and conclusion represent how many standard deviations above or below the mean population a score derived from a Z-test is.
 
 
  Examples of tests that can be conducted as Z-tests include a one-sample location test, a two-sample location test, a paired difference test, and a maximum likelihood estimate. Z-tests are closely related to T-tests, but T-tests are best performed when an experiment has a small sample size. Also, T-tests assume the standard deviation is unknown, while Z-tests assume it is known. If the standard deviation of the population is unknown, the assumption of the sample variance equaling the population variance is made.
 
 
   Formula for Z-Score 
 The Z-score is calculated with the formula: z = ( x - μ ) / σ Where: z = Z-score x = the value being evaluated μ = the mean σ = the standard deviation 
 
    One-Sample Z-Test Example    
  Assume an investor wishes to test whether the average daily return of a stock is greater than 3%. A random sample of 50 returns is calculated with an average of 2%. Assume the standard deviation of the returns is 2.5%. Therefore, the null hypothesis is when the average, or mean, equals 3%.

  Conversely, the alternative hypothesis is whether the mean return is greater or less than 3%. Assume an alpha of 0.05% is selected with a  two-tailed test . There are 0.025% of the samples in each tail, and the alpha has a critical value of 1.96 or -1.96. If ""Z"" is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected.
 
 
  The value for Z is calculated by subtracting the value of the average daily return selected for the test, or 3% in this case, from the observed average of the samples. Next, divide the resulting value by the  standard deviation  divided by the square root of the number of observed values.
 
 
  Therefore, the test statistic is:
 
 
  (0.02 - 0.03) ÷ (0.025 ÷ √ 50) = -2.83
 
 
  The investor rejects the null hypothesis since z is less than -1.96 and concludes that the average daily return is less than 3%. 
 
 
   What's the Difference Between a T-Test and Z-Test? 
 T-tests are best performed when the data consists of a small sample size, i.e., less than 30. T-tests assume the standard deviation is unknown, while Z-tests assume it is known. 
 
 
   When Should You Use a Z-Test? 
 If the standard deviation of the population is known and the sample size is greater than or equal to 30, the Z-test can be used. Regardless of the sample size, if the population standard deviation is unknown, a T-test should be used instead. 
 
 
   What Is Central Limit Theorem (CLT)? 
 In the study of probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample approximates a normal distribution (also known as a “ bell curve ”) as the sample size becomes larger, assuming that all samples are identical in size, and regardless of the population distribution shape. Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are considered sufficient for the CLT to predict the characteristics of a population accurately. The Z-test's fidelity relies on the CLT holding. 
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  A Z-test is used in hypothesis testing to evaluate whether a finding or association is statistically significant. In particular, it","By

"Antwerp Rules: Meaning, Origin, When it's Used","Close 
 
 
 
    What Are York Antwerp Rules?    
  The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime regulations concerning protocols surrounding jettisoned  cargo . Often, contracts and bills of lading will include these maritime rules and use them as a framework to establish liability and assign costs for lost and damaged cargo. The rules are broken into provisions that help set cost obligations. Provisions include the general average to help allocate the cost of losses, the particular average relating to the cargo owner, and the salvage average applied to salvage operations and rescue crews.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime regulations surrounding jettisoned cargo. The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime rules dating back to 1890. The rules are a codification of the law of general average. 
 
    How York Antwerp Rules Work    
  The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime rules that were established in 1890. Amended several times since their inception, this set of maritime rules outlines the rights and obligations of both ship and cargo owners in the case that cargo must be jettisoned in order to save a ship. Generally, bills of lading, contracts of affreightment and marine  insurance policies  all include the York Antwerp Rules in their language.
 
 
  The York Antwerp Rules state three clear principles, all of which must be met in order for the rule to be applied. The first stipulation is that danger to the ship must be imminent. Second, there must be a voluntary jettison of a portion of the  ship’s cargo  in order to save the whole. Third, the attempt to avoid the danger must be successful. If a situation meets all the stipulations, all parties involved in the maritime adventure must share proportionately in the financial burden of the losses incurred to the owner or owners of any of the cargo that was jettisoned in order to save the vessel.
 
 
   Important 
 All three principles of the York Antwerp Rules must be met for the rules to apply. 
 
 
 
    Origins of the York Antwerp Rules    
  The York Antwerp Rules are a codification of a principle called the law of general average. Though the York Antwerp Rules are quite old themselves, the law of general average is a much older  maritime  principle with roots that go back to Ancient Greece. The law specifies that all parties involved in a sea venture must proportionately share in any losses that result from sacrifices made to the cargo to save the remainder.
 
 
 
 
    When Do You Use the York Antwerp Rules?    
  In a life-threatening situation at sea, the captain and crew may deem it necessary to jettison the cargo. To jettison cargo is a maritime term that is the last resort in an emergency situation where the crew throws the cargo overboard in order to stabilize the vessel. If there is a threat to a ship, due to damage to the hull, weather conditions, etc., the staff will jettison the cargo.
 
 
  While jettisoning happens as a last resort, the crew must move quickly when they throw the cargo overboard, which means they do not have time to see whose cargo gets tossed. This is when the York Antwerp Rules come into play, as those who lost their cargo will receive compensation from the profits of the ship’s owner and the owners of the other cargo.

"Amortized Loan: What It Is, How It Works, Loan Types, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is an Amortized Loan?    
  An amortized loan is a type of loan with scheduled, periodic payments that are applied to both the loan's principal amount and accrued interest.
 
 
  An amortized loan payment first pays off the relevant interest expense for the period, after which the remainder reduces the principal amount. Common amortized loans include auto loans, fixed-rate  mortgages , home equity loans, and  personal loans from a bank  for small projects or  debt consolidation .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An amortized loan reflects the payment schedule that comprises periodic, fixed payments in which a portion goes to interest and principal.  An amortized loan payment first pays off the interest for the period, with the remaining amount reducing the principal. As a borrower makes payments over time, the interest portion of the payments for an amortization loan decreases, while the principal increases. 
 
    How an Amortized Loan Works    
  With an amortized loan, a portion of each fixed monthly payment goes to paying the  monthly interest  and reducing the principal—the original borrowed amount. The interest on an amortized loan is calculated based on the most recent ending balance of  the loan .
 
 
    Principal and Interest    
  As a borrower makes payments over time, the principal decreases, reducing the balance on which the interest is calculated. As a result, the interest amount owed decreases over time.
 
 
  As the interest portion of an amortized loan decreases, the principal portion of the payment increases. Therefore,  interest and principal  have an inverse relationship within the payments over the life of the amortized loan. 1 
 
 
    Calculating an Amortized Loan    
  An amortized loan is the result of a series of calculations. First, the loan's current balance is multiplied by the interest rate attributable to the current period to find the interest due for the period. (Annual interest rates may be divided by 12 to find a monthly rate.)
 
 
 
 
  Subtracting the interest due for the period from the total monthly payment results in the dollar amount of principal paid in the period.
 
 
  The principal amount paid in the period is applied to the outstanding loan balance. Therefore, the current loan balance, minus the principal amount paid in the period, results in the new outstanding loan balance, which is used to calculate the interest for the next period.
 
 
   Warning 
 Mortgage  lending discrimination is illegal.  If you think you ’ ve been discriminated against  based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report, either to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  or the  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) . 2 
 
 
 
    Amortized Loans vs. Balloon Loans vs. Revolving Debt (Credit Cards)    
  While amortized loans, balloon loans, and revolving debt—specifically credit cards—share similarities, they have important distinctions you should be aware of before signing up.
 
 
    Amortized Loans    
  Typically, amortized loans get paid off over an extended period of time, with equal amounts paid for each payment period. Amortized loans have an amortization schedule in which a portion of each fixed monthly payment comprises the  monthly interest  and the principal loan balance.
 
 
  However, borrowers can make an extra payment to reduce the principal owed, but the remaining monthly payments will remain unchanged. In other words, paying extra on an amortized loan reduces the  loan  balance, shortens the loan term and saves you interest, but it does not change the monthly payment.
 
 
    Balloon Loans    
   Balloon loans  usually have a relatively short term, and only a portion of the loan's principal balance is amortized over that term. At the end of the term, the remaining balance is due as a final repayment, which is generally large—at least double the amount of previous payments. 3 
 
 
    Revolving Debt (Credit Cards)     
  Credit cards are the most well-known type of revolving debt, which allows you to borrow up to a preset credit limit. In other words, you can no longer borrow from a revolving credit line if you have reached your credit limit.
 
 
  However, if you pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on a revolving credit, your credit availability increases by that amount. As a result, a revolving credit allows you to pay off and borrow again up to your credit limit indefinitely.
 
 
  Credit cards work differently from amortized loans because they don't have set payment amounts or a fixed loan amount. Credit card  minimum monthly payments  typically do not include any principal, meaning the payment only covers the monthly interest cost. 4 
 
 
   Important 
 Amortized loans apply each payment to both interest and principal, initially paying more interest than principal until eventually that ratio is reversed","By

"Management by Objectives (MBO): Learn Its 5 Steps, Pros and Cons","Definition 
 Management by objectives is a management approach where objectives are set by an agreement between a manager and an employer to incentivize employee participation. 
    What Is Management by Objectives (MBO)?    
  Management by objectives (MBO) is a  strategic management  approach in which the performance goals of an organization are aligned with the objectives of its employees and management. The goal is to improve the organization’s performance by clearly defining objectives.
 
 
  According to the theory, having a say in goal setting and action plans encourages participation and commitment among employees, and aligns objectives across the organization.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Management by objectives (MBO) is a process in which a manager and an employee agree on specific performance goals and then develop a plan to reach them. It is designed to align objectives throughout an organization and boost employee participation and commitment. There are five steps: define objectives, share them with employees, encourage employees to participate, monitor progress, and finally, evaluate performance and reward achievements. Critics of MBO argue that it incentivizes employees to achieve these goals by any means necessary, often at the cost of the company. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Katie Kerpel / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Management by Objectives (MBO)    
  Management by objectives (also known as management by planning) is the establishment of a  management information system (MIS)  to compare actual performance and achievements with the defined objectives. Practitioners claim the major benefits of MBO are that it improves employee motivation and commitment and allows for better communication between management and employees.
 
 
  However, a cited weakness of MBO is that it unduly emphasizes setting goals to attain objectives, rather than working on a systematic plan to do so. Critics of MBO, such as  W. Edwards Deming , argue that setting particular goals like production targets leads workers to meet those targets by any means necessary, including shortcuts that result in poor quality. 1 
 
 
 
 
  In his book that coined the term, Peter Drucker set forth several principles for MBO. Objectives are laid out with the help of employees and are meant to be challenging but achievable. Employees receive daily feedback, and the focus is on rewards rather than punishment. Personal growth and development are emphasized, rather than negative feedback for failing to reach objectives. 2 
 
 
   Note 
 MBO is not a cure-all but a tool to be utilized. It gives organizations a process, with many practitioners claiming that the success of MBO is dependent on the support from top management, clearly outlined objectives, and trained managers who can implement it. 
 
    Steps of MBO    
  MBO outlines five steps that organizations should use to put the management technique into practice.
 
 
 
 Either determine or revise organizational objectives for the entire company. This broad overview should be derived from the firm’s  mission  and vision. 
 Translate the organizational objectives to employees. In 1981, George T. Doran used the acronym SMART (specific, measurable, acceptable (or achievable or attainable), realistic (or relevant), time-bound) to express the concept. 3 
 Stimulate the participation of employees in setting individual objectives. After the organization’s objectives are shared with employees from the top to the bottom, employees should be encouraged to help set their own objectives to achieve these larger organizational objectives. This gives employees greater motivation since they have greater empowerment. 
 Monitor the progress of employees. In this way, managers can measure and track the goals set by employees. As step two states, a key component of the objectives is that they are measurable for employees and managers to determine how well they are met across a given time frame. 
 Evaluate and reward employee progress. This step includes honest feedback on what was achieved and not achieved for each employee. 
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of MBO    
  MBO comes with many advantages and disadvantages.
 
 
    Advantages    
 
 Employees take pride in their work and are assigned goals they know they can achieve that match their strengths, skills, and educational experiences. 
 Assigning tailored goals brings a sense of importance to employees, boosting their output and loyalty to the company. 
 Communication between  management  and employees is increased. 
 Management can create goals that lead to the success of the company. 
 
 
    Disadvantages    
 
 As MBO is focused on goals and targets, it often ignores other parts of a company, such as the culture of conduct, a healthy work ethos, and areas for involvement and contribution. 
 Strain is increased on employees to meet the goals in a specified time frame. 
 Employees are encouraged to  meet targets by any means necessary , meaning",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/management-by-objectives.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"GDP Per Capita: Definition, Uses, and Highest Per Country","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 GDP per capita is a metric that indicates an economy's gross domestic product per person, used as a measure of prosperity. 
    What Is GDP Per Capita?    
  Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is an economic metric that breaks down a country’s economic output to a per-person allocation. Economists use GDP per capita to determine the prosperity of countries based on their economic growth. Countries with a higher GDP per capita tend to be those that are industrial and developed and have smaller populations compared to others.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Gross domestic product per capita is a country’s economic output per person. It’s calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. GDP per capita, along with overall GDP, is used by economists to analyze the economic prosperity of a country and to compare it to other countries. It’s important to consider how much GDP and population each affect the GDP per capita figure. Small, rich countries and more developed industrial nations tend to have the highest GDP per capita. 
 
    How GDP Per Capita Works    
   Gross domestic product  per capita is a global measurement used by economists to gauge the prosperity of nations based on economic growth.
 
 
  There are a few ways to analyze a country’s wealth and prosperity. GDP per capita is the most universal because its components are regularly tracked on a global scale, providing ease of calculation and usage.  Income per capita  is another measure for global prosperity analysis, but it’s less broadly used. 1 2 
 
 
  The most basic interpretation of GDP per capita shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each individual citizen. Alternatively, GDP per capita translates to a measure of national wealth because GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure. 1 
 
 
    GDP Per Capita vs. GDP    
  GDP itself is the primary measure of a country’s economic productivity. A country’s GDP shows the market value of the goods and services it produces. The  Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)  reports GDP every quarter in the United States. Economists watch this quarterly report closely for the quarter-over-quarter and annual growth figures that can assist them in analyzing the overall health of the economy.

  Economists also use GDP for insight into how their domestic productivity compares to the productivity of other countries. Legislators use GDP figures when making  fiscal policy  decisions. GDP can also influence central bankers when they’re deciding the course of future  monetary policy .
 
 
  GDP per capita is often analyzed along with GDP. It relates to both a country’s GDP and its population, so it can be important to understand how each factor affects GDP per capita growth. 3 
 
 
   $69,006 
 Real GDP per capita in the U.S. for Q4 2024. 4 
 
    Implications of GDP Per Capita    
  Governments can use GDP per capita to understand how their economies are growing along with their  populations . GDP per capita analysis on a national level can provide insights into a country’s domestic population influence.
 
 
  Look at each variable’s contribution to the per capita figure to understand how an economy is growing or contracting relative to its population. There can be several numerical relationships that affect GDP per capita.
 
 
  Growth can potentially be the result of technological advances that increase productivity with no change in population if a country’s GDP per capita is growing while the population level remains stable. Technology can be a revolutionary factor that helps countries increase their per capita rankings even as population figures are unchanged or decline.
 
 
   Important 
 Some countries may have a high GDP per capita but a small population. This usually means that they’ve built a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources. 
 
 
 
    Negative GDP Per Capita Growth    
  A nation may have consistent economic growth but GDP per capita growth will be negative if its population is growing faster than its GDP. This isn’t a problem for most  established economies  because even a tepid pace of economic growth can still outpace their population growth rates.
 
 
  However, countries with existing low levels of GDP per capita, such as nations in Africa, and rapidly increasing populations combined with little GDP growth can experience a steady erosion of living standards. 5 
 
 
    GDP and Population Growth    
  Both GDP and population are factors in the per capita equation, so countries with the highest GDP may or may not have the highest GDP per capita.

"Senior Bank Loan: Definition, How It Works, Rates & Risks","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Senior Bank Loan?    
  A senior bank loan is a  debt financing  obligation issued to a company by a bank or similar financial institution and then repackaged and sold to investors. The repackaged debt obligation consists of multiple loans. Senior bank loans hold legal claim to the borrower's assets above all other debt obligations.
 
 
  Because it is considered senior to all other claims against the borrower, in the event of a  bankruptcy , it will be the first loan to be repaid before any other creditors, preferred stockholders, or common stockholders receive repayment. Senior bank loans are usually secured via a  lien  against the assets of the borrower.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A senior bank loan is a corporate loan repackaged into a bundle of corporate loans that is sold to investors. Senior bank loans take priority over all of the other debt obligations of a borrower. In the event of a bankruptcy, senior bank loans receive payment before other creditors, preferred stockholders, and common stockholders, when the assets of the borrower are sold off. Senior bank loans are typically secured via a lien against the assets of the borrower. Senior bank loans most often come with floating interest rates. Historically, lenders that issue senior bank loans have been able to recover the entirety of the loan when the borrower has defaulted. Senior bank loans typically provide high-yield returns for investors and protection against inflation 
 
    How a Senior Bank Loan Works    
  Loans are often used to provide a business with cash to continue its daily operations or any other capital needs that it may have. The loans are generally backed by the company's inventory, property, equipment, or real estate, as  collateral . Banks often take the multiple loans they make, repackage them into one debt obligation, and sell them off to investors as a financial product. The investors then receive the interest payments as the return on their investment.
 
 
  Because senior bank loans are at the top of a company’s capital structure, if the company files for  bankruptcy , the secured assets are typically sold and the proceeds are distributed to senior loan holders before any other type of lender is paid back.
 
 
 
 
  Historically, the majority of businesses with senior bank loans that ended up filing for bankruptcy have been able to cover the loans entirely, meaning the lenders/investors have been paid back. Because senior bank loans take precedence in the repayment structure they are relatively safe, though they are still considered non- investment grade  assets, as most of the time the corporate loans in the bundle are made to non-investment grade companies.
 
 
  Senior bank loans typically have  floating interest rates  that fluctuate according to the  London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR) or other common benchmarks. For example, if a bank’s rate is LIBOR + 5%, and LIBOR is 3%, the loan's interest rate will be 8%. Because loan rates often change monthly or quarterly, interest on a senior bank loan may increase or decrease at regular intervals. This rate is also the yield that investors will make on their investment. The floating rate aspect of a senior bank loan provides investors with protection against rising short term interest rates, as a protection against  inflation .
 
 
  In the repayment structure, after senior bank loans, which are typically classified as first lien and second lien, comes  unsecured debt  followed by equity.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Businesses that take out senior bank loans often have lower credit ratings than their peers, so the credit risk to the lender is typically greater than it would be with most corporate bonds. What's more, the valuations of senior bank loans fluctuate often and may be volatile. This was especially true during the  financial crisis  of 2008.
 
 
  Because of their inherent risk and volatility, senior bank loans typically pay the lender a higher yield than investment-grade corporate bonds. However, because the lenders are assured of getting at least some portion of their money back before the company's other creditors in the event of insolvency, the loans yield less than  high-yield bonds , which carry no such promise.
 
 
  Investing in mutual funds or  exchange traded funds  (ETFs) that specialize in senior bank loans may make sense for some investors who are seeking regular income and who are willing to assume the additional risk and volatility. Here's why:
 
 
 
 Because of the loans’ floating rate, when the  Federal Reserve  raises interest rates, the loans will deliver higher yields. 
 In addition, senior bank loan funds typically have a risk-adjusted return over a three-to-five-year period that makes them attractive to fairly conservative investors. When the loan funds underperform, bonds sell at a discount to par, increasing an investor’s yield. 
 
 
  Investors can also take some reassurance from the fact that senior ban","By

    What Is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP)?    
  A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business venture in the form of a publicly traded  limited partnership . It combines the tax benefits of a private partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded company.
 
 
  A master limited partnership trades on an exchange. MLPs generally experience cash flow stability and are required by the partnership agreement to distribute a set amount of cash to their investors. Their structure can also help reduce the cost of capital in capital-intensive businesses such as the energy sector.
 
 
  The first MLP was organized in 1981. However, by 1987, Congress effectively limited the use of them to the real estate and natural resources sectors. These limitations were put into place out of concern over too much lost corporate tax revenue. MLPs do not pay federal income taxes. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A master limited partnership (MLP) is a company organized as a publicly traded partnership. MLPs combine a private partnership's tax advantages with a stock's liquidity. MLPs have two types of partners: general partners who manage the MLP and oversee its operations, and limited partners who are investors in the MLP. Investors receive distributions that are not double-taxed like corporate dividends. MLPs are considered relatively low-risk, long-term investments, providing a slow but steady income stream. 
 
    Understanding Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)    
  The MLP is a hybrid legal entity that combines elements of two business structures—a partnership and a corporation. It is considered to be the aggregate of its partners rather than a separate legal entity (like a corporation).
 
 
  An MLP technically has no employees. The general partners are responsible for providing all necessary operational services. General partners usually hold stakes of about 2% in the venture and have the option to increase their ownership. 1 3

  An MLP issues units instead of shares. These units can be bought and sold on stock exchanges. As a result, they are a liquid security. Traditional partnerships cannot offer the same level of  liquidity .
 
 
 
 
  Since an MLP's publicly traded units are not stock shares, those who invest in MLPs are commonly referred to as unitholders rather than shareholders. Those who buy into an MLP are called limited partners. These unitholders are allocated a share of the MLP's income, deductions, losses, and credits. 1 
 
 
  MLPs have two classes of partners:
 
 
 
 Limited partners  are investors who purchase shares in the MLP and provide the capital for the entity's operations. They receive periodic distributions from the MLP, typically every quarter. Limited partners are also known as silent partners. 
 General partners  are the owners who are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the MLP. They receive compensation based on the partnership's business performance. 
 
 
    Tax Treatment of MLPs    
    Pass-Through Tax Consequences    
  An MLP is treated as a limited partnership for tax purposes, which is a significant  tax advantage  for investors.
 
 
  A limited partnership has a pass-through, or flow-through, tax structure. This means that all profits and losses are passed through to the limited partners. The MLP itself pays no taxes on its profits, unlike corporations. Instead, the limited partners  pay income taxes on their portions  of the MLP's earnings. 4 1

Limited partners can use these deductions to redu","0 seconds of 1 minute, 40 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mlp.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

    What Is a Ponzi Scheme?    
  A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that pays early investors with money taken from later investors to create an illusion of big profits. A Ponzi scheme promises a high rate of return with little risk to the investor. It relies on word-of-mouth, as new investors hear about the big returns earned by early investors. Inevitably, the scheme collapses when the flow of new money slows, making it impossible to keep up the payments of alleged profits.
 
 
  A Ponzi scheme is similar to a  pyramid scheme  in that both use new investors' funds to pay earlier backers. A pyramid scheme usually relies on rewarding early participants to recruit more participants but collapses when the supply of potential participants dwindles.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A Ponzi scheme relies on a growing stream of new investors to create an illusion of profit. Some of the new money is used to pay earlier investors, making the scam look legitimate and highly profitable. Most of the money is pocketed by the scam's operator. The scam collapses when the supply of new investors slows and the supposed profits evaporate. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / NoNo Flores 
 
    Understanding Ponzi Schemes    
  A Ponzi scheme is a type of  investment fraud  in which investors are promised big profits at little or no risk.
 
 
  The money is not invested. Rather, the scam artist concentrates on attracting more investors. A growing number of victims is needed to pay out the supposed profits being distributed to earlier investors.
 
 
  When the flow of new investment slows, the scam artist doesn't have enough money to pay out those supposed profits. That's when the Ponzi scheme collapses.
 
 
    Origins of the Ponzi Scheme    
  The Ponzi scheme gets its name from a swindler named  Charles Ponzi , who in 1920 became a millionaire by promoting a nonexistent investing opportunity. 1 
 
 
 
 
  Ponzi wasn't the first to perpetrate this type of fraud. Earlier schemes were reported in the 19th century and Charles Dickens dramatized the methods in two novels, ""The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit"" (1844) and ""Little Dorrit ,""  (1857.) 2 3 
 
 
  Charles Ponzi's original scheme, conceived in 1919, focused on the U.S. Postal Service and international mail. He received correspondence from someone in Spain who had prepaid international postage. This international postage reply coupon could be exchanged in the U.S. for postage to send a reply back to Spain. This gave Ponzi an idea. 4 
 
 
  There were tiny differences between the charges for the coupons and their redemption prices, based on differences in currency exchange rates. Scaled up, this could return a profit. The concept was a form of  arbitrage , which is not illegal.
 
 
   Important 
 Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide returns to earlier investors. 
 
 
 
  However, Ponzi was hardly engaging in this practice. It would eventually be discovered that he only had $61 worth of these postal coupons. He was collecting money from investors and paying out just enough to keep the scheme going. 4 
 
 
  It lasted until August 1920, when  The Boston Post  began investigating Ponzi's Securities Exchange Company and its promise of a 50% return in 90 days and later just 45 days. Ponzi was arrested by federal authorities on August 12, 1920, and charged with several counts of mail fraud. He served time in federal prison. 5 4 
 
 
  After his release, he was tried and convicted on state charges in Massachusetts. He then spent time running from the law and being arrested in other states, before being imprisoned in Massachusetts to serve his sentence. Following his release from state prison, Ponzi was deported to his native Italy. 4 5

 Definition 
 A SWOT analysis identifies a company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. 
    What Is a SWOT Analysis?    
  A SWOT analysis helps define a company's competitive position, assesses internal and external issues, and evaluates its current and future potential. It is a realistic, fact-based, data-driven analysis of an organization.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique. It evaluates information from all sources that may have uncontrollable impacts on a company's decisions. A SWOT analysis works when diverse groups within an organization provide realistic data points rather than prescribed messaging.

    Understanding SWOT Analyses    
  A SWOT analysis is a technique for assessing the performance, competition, risk, and potential of a business, as well as a part of a business, such as a product line or division, an industry, or other entity.
 
 
  Using internal and external data, the technique can guide businesses toward strategies more likely to be successful, and away from those in which they have been (or are likely to be) less successful. Independent SWOT analysts, investors, or competitors can also guide them on whether a company, product line, or industry might be strong or weak and why. 
 
 
   Important 
 The SWOT analysis was first used to analyze businesses. Now, it's often used by governments, nonprofits, and individuals, including investors and entrepreneurs. There are seemingly limitless applications to the SWOT analysis. 
 
 
 
    Components of SWOT Analysis    
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
  Every SWOT analysis includes four categories. Though the elements and discoveries within these categories will vary from company to company, a SWOT analysis is not complete without each of the following elements.
 
 
 
 
 
 Strengths:  Strengths describe what an organization excels at and what separates it from the competition: a strong brand, loyal customer base, a strong  balance sheet , unique technology, and so on. For example, a hedge fund may have developed a proprietary trading strategy that returns market-beating results. It must then decide how to use those results to attract new investors. 
 Weaknesses:  Weaknesses stop an organization from performing at its optimum level. These are areas where the business needs to improve to remain competitive: a weak brand, higher-than-average turnover, high levels of debt, an inadequate supply chain, or lack of capital. 
 Opportunities:  Opportunities are favorable external factors that could give an organization a competitive advantage. For example, if a country cuts tariffs, a car manufacturer can export its cars into a new market, increasing sales and market share. 
 Threats:  Threats   refer to factors that can potentially harm an organization. For example, a drought is a threat to a wheat-producing company, as it may destroy or reduce the crop yield. Other common threats include things like rising costs for materials, increasing competition, tight labor supply, and so on.

 Definition 
 A bond is a fixed-income investment issued by governments or corporations to raise funding. 
    What Is a Bond?    
  A bond is a fixed-income investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a specified interest rate for a predetermined period. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond.
 
 
  Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A bond is a fixed-income instrument that pays a fixed interest rate or coupon to the holders. Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa. Bonds are sold with maturity dates, which are the dates by which the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Ellen Lindner 
 
    How Bonds Work    
  Bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure projects. Corporations often borrow to grow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or hire employees.
 
 
  Bonds are  fixed-income securities  and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be repaid. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.
 
 
 
 
  The initial price of most bonds is typically set at what is called their par value, or the face value of one bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures.

   Fast Fact 
 Markets allow lenders to buy or sell their bonds to other investors long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date.

"Opportunity Cost: Definition, Formula, and Examples","Definition 
 Opportunity cost is any gain you pass up by deciding on one use of your resources over others. 
    What Is Opportunity Cost?    
  Opportunity cost represents the desirable benefits someone foregoes by choosing one alternative instead of another.
 
 
  While opportunity costs can't be predicted with total certainty, taking them into consideration can lead to better decision making. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Opportunity cost is the forgone benefit from an option that you failed to choose. To properly evaluate opportunity cost, the costs and benefits of every option available must be considered and weighed against the others. Considering potential opportunity costs can guide individuals and organizations to more profitable decision making. This cost of a lost benefit is a strictly internal measure used for strategic planning; it is not included in accounting profit or reflected in external financial reporting. Examples of opportunity cost considerations include investing in a new manufacturing plant in Los Angeles as opposed to Mexico City, deciding to upgrade company equipment rather than hire additional workers, or buying stock A and not stock B. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Mira Norian 
 
    Formula for Calculating Opportunity Cost    
  We can express the opportunity cost related to investing by calculating the difference between the expected returns of two investment options. 
 Opportunity Cost = RMPIC − RICP where: RMPIC = Return on most profitable investment choice RICP = Return on investment chosen to pursue \begin{aligned}&\text{Opportunity Cost} = \text{RMPIC}-\text{RICP}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{RMPIC}=\text{Return on most profitable investment choice}\\&\text{RICP}=\text{Return on investment chosen to pursue}\end{aligned} ​ Opportunity Cost = RMPIC − RICP where: RMPIC = Return on most profitable investment choice RICP = Return on investment chosen to pursue ​ 
 Consider a company that is faced with the following two mutually exclusive options: 
 Option A: Invest excess capital in the stock market 
 Option B: Invest excess capital back into the business for new equipment to increase production  
 Assume the expected  return on investment (ROI)  in the stock market is 10% over the next year, while the company estimates that the equipment update would generate an 8% return over the same time period. 
 The opportunity cost of choosing the equipment over the stock market is 2% (10% - 8%). In other words, by investing in the business, the company would forgo the opportunity to earn a higher return—at least for that first year.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 When considering two different securities, it is important to take risk into account. For example, comparing a  Treasury bill  to a highly  volatile  stock can be misleading, even if both have the same expected return (an opportunity cost of 0%). That's because the U.S. government backs the return on the T-bill, making it virtually risk-free, and there is no such guarantee in the stock market. 
 
 
 
    Opportunity Cost and Capital Structure    
  Opportunity cost analysis can play a crucial role in determining a company's  capital structure .
 
 
  A business incurs an explicit cost in taking on  debt  or issuing  equity  because it must compensate its lenders or shareholders. And each option also carries an opportunity cost.
 
 
  Money that a company uses to make payments on its bonds or other debt, for example, cannot be invested for other purposes.
 
 
  So the company must decide if financing an expansion or other growth opportunity with debt would be better than financing it with equity.
 
 
  Companies try to weigh the costs and benefits of borrowing money vs. issuing stock, including both monetary and non-monetary considerations, to arrive at an optimal balance that minimizes opportunity costs.
 
 
  Because opportunity cost is a forward-looking consideration, the actual  rate of return (RoR)  for both options is unknown at that point, making this evaluation tricky in practice.
 
 
    Examples of Opportunity Costs    
    For a Business    
  Assume that a business has $20,000 in available funds and must choose between investing the money in  securities , which it expects to return 10% a year, or using it to purchase new machinery.
 
 
  No matter which option the business chooses, the potential profit that it gives up by not investing in the other option is the opportunity cost.
 
 
  If the business decides to go with the securities option, its investment would theoretically gain $2,000 in the first year, $2,200 in the second, and $2,420 in the third.
 
 
  Alternatively, if the business purchases a new machine, it will be able to increase its production. But the machine setup and employee training will be intensive, and the new machine will not be up to maximum efficiency for the first couple of years.
 
 
  So the company estimates that it would net an additional $500 in profit in the first year, then $2,000 in year two","By

ADP National Employment Report: Definition and What It Covers,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the ADP National Employment Report?    
  The ADP National Employment Report is a monthly report of economic data that tracks the level of  nonfarm  private employment in the U.S. It is published by Automatic Data Processing. The ADP National Employment Report is also known as the ADP Jobs Report or the ADP Employment Report.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The ADP National Employment Report is a monthly report of economic data that tracks nonfarm private employment in the U.S. The ADP Employment Report provides historical data from 2010. Automatic Data Processing Inc., the company that issues the report, handles payroll for about one-fifth of all privately-employed individuals in the U.S. The ADP National Employment Report is viewed as a useful preview of the more detailed Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report. The ADP National Employment Report is divided into four separate releases. 
 
    Understanding the ADP National Employment Report    
  If you're not  self-employed  or a government employee, there is a decent chance that your pay statement is processed by Automatic Data Processing Inc. ( ADP ). The firm handles payroll for about a fifth of U.S. private employment, putting it in a unique position to survey trends in the nation’s  labor market . 1 
 
 
  ADP collects data through the payroll services and benefits administration it provides to companies. It issues reports on its findings through a partnership with Stanford Digital Economy Lab. 2 
 
 
  The ADP National Employment Report is released two days prior to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics'  employment situation  report , which is available on the first Friday of each month. Investors and economists see the ADP report as a preview of the more detailed and comprehensive government data release. 3 4 
 
 
    Details of the ADP National Employment Report    
  The methodology of the ADP   National Employment Report is managed by Stanford Digital Economy Lab using figures that are  seasonally adjusted .
 
 
  The report has two main sections: ""Change in U.S. Private Employment"" and ""Pay Insights."" Both of these sections are broken down as follows:
 
 
 
 
   Change in U.S. Private Employment:  This section provides an overall national number, then it breaks down the numbers by industry (goods-producing and service-providing), region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), and establishment size (small, medium, and large). All of these categories are broken down even further: industry by type, regions by smaller regions, and establishment size by the number of employees. 5 
 
 
   Pay Insights:  This section provides an overall median change in annual pay (job-stayers and job-changers). It then breaks the numbers down by industry sector (goods-producing and service-providing) and firm size (small, medium, and large). These are also broken down further as detailed above.
 
 
    The Monthly ADP National Employment Report    
  In April 2024, private-sector employment increased by 192,000 jobs. According to the ADP report, the average pace of hiring has grown over the past three months after a slowdown at the end of last year. 2 
 
 
  The report states that hiring was broad-based in the month with only the information sector, which includes media, telecommunications, and information technology, exhibiting weakness. This sector posted job losses and the smallest pace of growth in pay since August 2021. 2 
 
 
   Note 
 The ADP report is published by a private company, not a government agency. But historically, its figures tend to align closely with the official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 
    Special Considerations    
  The number of people that are employed can tell us a lot about the state of the economy. Total employment and the rate of unemployment are used to determine when the economy is in a recession. The chart below illustrates the monthly changes in nonfarm private employment data since 2002. As you can see, the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with a dramatic rise in  unemployment .
 
 
 
 
  A population that is fully employed and where many people are earning steady paychecks is synonymous with a strong economy. More real goods and services are being produced and, in turn, people are earning the income to buy them. More money is circulating, which triggers an increase in demand for goods and services, plus more job opportunities for people to help manufacture and sell them.
 
 
  Eventually, demand for labor can outstrip supply. When this occurs, employees have greater bargaining power and can demand better wages, which can lead to falling corporate profits, higher inflation, and pressure to raise interest rates.
 
 
   When Is the ADP National Employment Report Released? 
 The ADP National Employment Report is usually published two days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes its monthly employment report, which is issued on the first Friday of every month. Since the ADP report c","By

Jurisdiction Risk,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Jurisdiction Risk?    
  Jurisdiction risk refers to the risks that can arise when operating in a foreign country or jurisdiction. These risks can arise simply by doing business, or else by lending or borrowing money in another country. Risks could also stem from legal, regulatory, or political factors that exist in different countries or regions.
 
 
  In recent times, jurisdiction risk has focused increasingly on banks and financial institutions that are exposed to the volatility that some of the countries where they operate may be high-risk areas for money laundering and terrorism financing. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Jurisdiction risk is associated with operating in a foreign country or region. Jurisdiction risk can also be applied to times when an investor is exposed to unexpected changes in the laws. The U.S. government advises financial institutions to refer to updates from the Financial Action Task Force to identify potentially risky jurisdictions with weak measures to fight money laundering and terrorist financing. 2 
 
    How Jurisdiction Risk Works    
  Jurisdiction risk is any additional risk that arises from borrowing and lending or doing business in a foreign country. This risk can also refer to times when laws unexpectedly change in an area in which an investor has exposure. This type of jurisdiction risk can often lead to added price volatility. As a result, the added risk from volatility means investors will demand higher returns to offset the higher levels of risk being faced.
 
 
   Important 
 Political risk  is a form of jurisdiction risk whereby an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting  investment  returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers, or military control. 
 
 
 
  Some of the risks associated with jurisdiction risk that banks, investors, and companies may face include  legal complications ,  exchange rate  risks, and even  geopolitical risks .
 
 
 
 
  As mentioned above, jurisdiction risk has recently become synonymous with countries where money laundering and terrorist activities are high. These activities are generally believed to be prevalent in countries that are designated as non-cooperative by the  Financial Action Task Force  (FATF) or are identified by the  U.S. Treasury  as requiring special measures due to concerns about money laundering or corruption. 3 4  Because of the punitive fines and penalties that can be levied against a financial institution that is involved—even inadvertently—in money laundering or financing terrorism, most organizations have specific processes to assess and mitigate jurisdiction risk.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  The FATF publishes two documents publicly three times a year and has done so since 2000. These reports identify areas of the world that the FATF declares have weak efforts to combat both money laundering and terrorist financing. These countries are called Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs). 4 
 
 
  As of June 2021, the FATF listed the following 22 countries as monitored jurisdictions: Albania, Barbados, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cayman Islands, Haiti, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. 5  These NCCTs have deficiencies when it comes to placing  anti-money laundering  policies, as well as recognizing and fighting terrorist financing. But they have all committed to working with the FATF to address the deficiencies.
 
 
  The FATF placed both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (i.e., North Korea) and Iran on its call-to-action list. According to the FATF, North Korea still poses a great risk to international finance because of its lack of commitment and deficiencies in the noted areas. The FATF also indicated its concern over the country's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The organization noted Iran outlined its commitment to the FATF but has failed to enact its plan. 6 1 
 
 
    Examples of Jurisdiction Risk    
  Investors may experience jurisdiction risk in the form of  foreign exchange risk  (also known as currency risk). So, an international financial transaction may be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange. This can lead to a drop in the value of an investment. Foreign exchange risks can be mitigated by using hedging strategies including options and forward contracts.

"Assets Under Management (AUM): Definition, Calculation, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Assets under management (AUM) is the current value of all the investments entrusted to a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund (ETF), or an investment company. 
    What Are Assets Under Management (AUM)?    
  Assets under management (AUM) is the total market value of the investments held by a portfolio manager or investment company on behalf of clients. It is the total pool of money invested.
 
 
  The AUM of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the total amount of money invested in the fund. Similarly, your personal AUM is the amount you have invested.
 
 
  Investors consider AUM among other factors in choosing an investment or an investment company.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A fund or company's AUM fluctuates constantly, reflecting market conditions and the buying and selling activity of participants. Investors consider a large AUM as an indicator of stability and liquidity. A substantial AUM suggests that it is easy to sell shares, as the fund has plenty of liquidity. Fund management fees and expenses are often calculated as a percentage of the investor's AUM. 
 
    Understanding Assets Under Management (AUM)    
  AUM is a relevant number when looking at an investment fund or family of funds, a venture capital firm, a brokerage company, or an individual registered as an investment advisor or  portfolio manager .
 
 
  When calculating AUM, some financial institutions include bank deposits,  mutual funds , and cash, while others limit it to funds from individual investors that are under their discretionary management.

  AUM includes the capital the manager can use to make transactions for one or all clients. An investor may need a minimum amount of personal AUM to qualify for a type of investment, such as a hedge fund. An investor’s AUM may determine the type of services received from a  financial advisor  or brokerage company.
 
 
 
 
  When an investor has $50,000 in a mutual fund, that money is counted in the total AUM of the fund. The fund manager can buy and sell shares without obtaining special permission from the client, as long as the stated investment objectives are followed.
 
 
   Important 
 Investors often consider a higher AUM as a positive indicator of management quality. 
 
 
 
    Calculating AUM    
  The calculation for assets under management varies somewhat among companies and depends on the flow of investor money in and out of a fund. The numbers also fluctuate constantly in response to the ups and downs of the markets and the amount of cash deposited or withdrawn by its investors.
 
 
   Asset performance , capital appreciation, and reinvested dividends increase the AUM of a fund. Assets under management also increase when new customers sign on.
 
 
  A decrease in AUM occurs following losses in the market value, fund closures, and decreased investor inflows.
 
 
  Calculating AUM involves aggregating the total market value of all assets that an investment manager oversees on behalf of clients. This can include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, cash equivalents, and other types of securities.
 
 
  The process entails identifying and valuing each asset held within client portfolios, taking into account factors such as current market prices, fair values, and any applicable currency conversions.
 
 
  Once the market values of all assets are determined, they are all added together to get AUM.
 
 
    AUM and SEC Regulation    
  The  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) requires most firms with AUM ranging between $25 million to $110 million to register with the SEC, depending on several factors, including the size and location of the firm. 1 
 
 
  In addition, state securities regulators have authority over advisers handling up to $100 million. Advisers with assets under management below $100 million are required to register with the securities regulator of the state where their principal place of business is located. 2 
 
 
  If a state-registered adviser's AUM hits the $100 million threshold, the company may choose to register with the SEC. Once the company's AUM surpasses $110 million, registration with the SEC is usually mandatory. 2 
 
 
    AUM and Fees    
  AUM can be a consideration when calculating fees. Many investment products charge  management fees  as a fixed percentage of the investor's AUM. Financial advisors and personal money managers also charge their clients a fee as a percentage of personal assets under management.
 
 
  The relationship between AUM and fees is not necessarily straightforward. For example, you may assume that as an investor's AUM increases, so do the fees earned by investment man","By

 Definition 
 Return on investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment. 
    What Is Return on Investment (ROI)?    
  Expressed as a percentage, return on Investment (ROI) is a financial ratio that measures the profit generated by an investment relative to its cost. Key factors influencing ROI include the initial investment amount, ongoing maintenance costs, and the cash flow generated by the investment.
 
 
  To calculate ROI, the return of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment. The result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Return on Investment (ROI) is a popular profitability metric used to evaluate how well an investment has performed. ROI is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing an investment's net profit (or loss) by its initial cost or outlay. ROI can be used to make apples-to-apples comparisons and rank investments in different projects or assets. ROI does not account for the holding period or passage of time, and therefore, it can overlook the opportunity costs of investing elsewhere. Whether an asset delivers a good ROI should be compared to other available opportunities. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Lara Antal 
 
    How to Calculate Return on Investment (ROI)    
  The return on investment (ROI) formula is as follows: 
 ROI = Current Value of Investment − Cost of Investment Cost of Investment \begin{aligned} &\text{ROI} = \dfrac{\text{Current Value of Investment}-\text{Cost of Investment}}{\text{Cost of Investment}}\\ \end{aligned} ​ ROI = Cost of Investment Current Value of Investment − Cost of Investment ​ ​   
 The ""Current Value of Investment"" is the value of an investment at a given moment. For stocks or other similar investments, it is the current market value, plus any fees or other expenses incurred at the time of purchase. 
 For a project, it includes factors like the discounted cash flow over the investment's lifetime and any maintenance costs incurred.  ""Cost of Investment"" is how much an investment was purchased for, including fees and expenses. Project costs at the time the project was financed are included. 
 Because ROI is measured as a percentage, it can be easily compared with returns from other investments, allowing one to measure a variety of investment types against one another.
 
 
 
 
    Why Is ROI a Useful Measurement?    
  ROI is a popular metric because of its versatility and simplicity. Essentially, ROI can be used as a rudimentary gauge of an investment’s profitability. This could be the ROI on a stock investment, the ROI a company expects on expanding a factory, or the ROI generated in a real estate transaction.

  The calculation itself is not complicated, and it is relatively easy to interpret for its wide range of applications. If an investment’s ROI is net positive, it is probably worthwhile. But if other opportunities with higher ROIs are available, these signals can help investors eliminate or select the best options. Likewise, investors should avoid  negative ROIs , which imply a net loss.

"Yield Basis: What it Means, How it Works","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Yield Basis?    
  The yield basis is a method of quoting the price of a  fixed-income security  as a yield percentage, rather than as a dollar value. This allows bonds with varying characteristics to be easily compared. The yield basis is calculated by dividing the coupon amount paid annually by the  bond  purchase price.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The yield basis method quotes the price of a fixed-income security (such as a bond) as a yield percentage instead of a dollar value. The yield basis method helps bond buyers easily compare the characteristics of various bonds before making a purchase. The yield quote tells the bond trader whether the bond is currently trading at a discount or premium compared to other bonds. Purchasing a bond on a net yield basis means the yield also includes the broker's profit or markup for executing the trade. 
 
    Understanding Yield Basis    
  Unlike stocks, which are quoted in dollars, most bonds are quoted with a yield basis. For example, assume a company is listed with a 6.75%  coupon rate  and is set to mature 10 years from the date of issuance. The $1,000 par bond is trading at a dollar value of $940.
 
 
  The yield basis can be calculated using the  current yield  formula presented as: 1 
 
 
  Coupon / Purchase Price
 
 
  Following our example above, the coupon to be paid annually is 6.75% x $1,000 = $67.50. Therefore, the yield basis is $67.50 / $940 = 0.0718, or 7.18%. The bond will be quoted to investors as having a yield basis of 7.18%.
 
 
  The yield quote tells a bond trader that the bond is currently trading  at a discount  because its yield basis is greater than its coupon rate (6.75%). If the yield basis is less than the coupon rate, this would indicate that the bond is trading  at a premium  since a higher coupon rate increases the value of the bond in the markets. 2  A bond trader could then compare the bond to others within a certain industry.
 
 
    Bank Discount Yield    
  The yield basis of a pure discount instrument can be calculated using the  bank discount yield  formula, which is:
 
 
 
 
  r = (Discount / Par Value) x (360/t) where r = Annualized yield Discount = Par value minus purchase price t = time left to maturity 360 = Bank convention for the number of days in a year
 
 
  Unlike the current yield, the bank discount yield takes the discount  value from par  and expresses it as a fraction of the par value, not the current price, of the bond. This method of calculating the yield basis assumes simple interest; that is, no compounding effect is factored in.  Treasury bills  are  quoted only on a bank discount basis . 3 
 
 
  For example, assume a Treasury bill with a $1,000 face value is selling for $970. If its time to maturity is 180 days, the yield basis will be:
 
 
  r = [($1,000 - $970)/$1,000] x (360/180) r = ($30/$1,000) x 2 r = 0.06 or 6%
 
 
  As Treasury bills pay no coupon, the bondholder will earn a dollar return equal to the discount if the bond is held until it matures.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  When purchasing bonds, it's important for the investor to understand the difference between the yield basis and the net yield basis. On the  secondary market , you can purchase bonds through a broker/dealer, who could charge you a flat commission for this service. However, in lieu of a commission, your broker may opt to sell bonds on a net yield basis.
 
 
  Net yield means the yield also includes the broker's profit for the transaction. This is the broker's  markup , which is the difference between what the broker paid for the bonds and what the  broker sells  them for. If a broker offers bonds on a net yield basis, they've already included their markup. For example, if an online broker sells you a bond with a 3.75%  yield to maturity (YTM) , their profit is embedded directly in the price you pay and there is no separate commission.
 
 
  When comparing various bonds for a possible purchase, bond buyers should ask their broker if the bonds are on a net yield basis or if they charge a separate commission to execute the trade. Brokers might charge other fees, such as a broker-assisted fee for transactions not conducted online. Your overall cost for the trade may also include  accrued interest , which is the interest accrued on the bond between the last payment and the settlement date.

  Equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life.

   Key Takeaways 
 Equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life. EAC is often used by firms for capital budgeting decisions, as it allows a company to compare the cost-effectiveness of various assets that have unequal lifespans. EAC allows managers to compare the net present values of different projects over different periods, to accurately determine the best option. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Mira Norian 
 
    Understanding the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)    
  Equivalent annual cost (EAC) is used for a variety of purposes, including capital budgeting. But it is used most often to analyze two or more possible projects with different lifespans, where costs are the most relevant variable.
 
 
  Other uses of EAC include calculating the optimal life of an asset, determining if leasing or purchasing an asset is the better option, determining the magnitude of which maintenance costs will impact an asset, determining the necessary cost savings to support purchasing a new asset, and determining the cost of keeping existing equipment.
 
 
  The EAC calculation factors in a discount rate or the cost of capital.  Cost of capital  is the required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project—such as building a new factory—worthwhile. Cost of capital includes the cost of debt and the cost of equity and is used by companies internally to judge whether a capital project is worth the expenditure of resources.
 
 
    The Formula for the Equivalent Annual Cost    
   EAC = Asset Price × Discount Rate 1 − ( 1 + Discount Rate ) − n where: Discount Rate = Return required to make project worthwhile n = Number of periods \begin{aligned} &\text{EAC} = \frac{ \text{Asset Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} }{ 1 - ( 1 + \text{Discount Rate})^{-n} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{Discount Rate} = \text{Return required to make project} \\ &\text{worthwhile} \\ &n = \text{Number of periods} \\ \end{aligned} ​ EAC = 1 − ( 1 + Discount Rate ) − n Asset Price × Discount Rate ​ where: Discount Rate = Return required to make project worthwhile n = Number of periods ​ ﻿
 
 
 
 
    How to Calculate the Equivalent Annual Cost    
 
 Take the asset price or cost and multiply it by the discount rate. 
 The discount rate is also called the  cost of capital,  which is the required return necessary to make a  capital budgeting  project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile. 
 In the denominator add 1 + the discount rate and raise the result as an exponent to the number of years for the project. Subtract the result by 1 and divide the numerator figure by the denominator. 
 Many financial online calculators are available to calculate EAC. 
 
 
    Example of the Equivalent Annual Cost    
  As stated earlier, EAC allows managers to compare NPVs of different projects over different periods, to accurately determine the best option. Consider two alternative investments in machinery equipment: 
 1. Machine A has the following: 
 
 An initial capital outlay of $105,000 
 An expected lifespan of three years 
 An annual maintenance expense of $11,000

Total Expense Ratio (TER): Definition and How to Calculate,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The TER covers the annual costs of running a fund based on all the known expenses associated with the fund’s operation. 
    What Is the Total Expense Ratio (TER)?    
  The total expense ratio (TER) is a measure of the total costs associated with managing and operating an  investment fund  such as a mutual fund. This expense ratio is the fee charged to investors. These costs consist primarily of  management fees  and additional expenses such as trading fees, legal fees, auditor fees, and other operational expenses.
 
 
  The total cost of the fund is divided by the fund’s total  assets  to arrive at a percentage amount, which represents the TER. The TER is also known as the net expense ratio or  after reimbursement expense ratio .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The expense ratio is the fee paid by those who invest in a fund. 
 It is a measure of a fund’s  operational efficiency . 
 Investors pay attention to the expense ratio to determine if a fund is an appropriate investment for them after fees are considered. 
 TER is also known as the net expense ratio or after reimbursement expense ratio. 
 
 
    How the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Works    
  The size of the TER is important to investors as the costs are withdrawn from the fund, affecting investors’  returns . For example, if a fund generates a return of 7% for the year but has a TER of 4%, then the 7% gain is greatly diminished to 3%.
 
 
  The TER provides a way for the annual costs of running a particular fund to be covered. It takes all of the known costs associated with the fund’s operation and expresses them as a single number, generally as a percentage, drawing its basis from the assets associated with the fund. This means that the gross amount paid by investors as the TER is dependent on the size of the fund.
 
 
  The funds supplied through the TER are used to support the management, trading, and legal fees associated with the fund, as well as any  audit  costs or general  operating expenses . Anytime a fund incurs higher or lower operating expenses, those changes are likely passed along within the TER.
 
 
 
 
  The more  actively managed  the fund, the higher the associated TER. This is due to increased personnel costs, as well as increased transaction-based fees—the fund manager pays a  brokerage fee  each time a buy and sell trade is executed. By comparison, an automated or  passive  fund has significantly lower costs of operation, resulting in a lower TER.
 
 
    Total Expense Ratio (TER) Formula and Calculation    
  Below is the formula and the steps to calculate the TER:
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   TER formula. 
 Investopedia  
 
  To calculate the TER:
 
 
 
 Obtain the total assets of the fund, which can be derived from financial disclosures that  mutual funds  report to regulators or are disseminated to analysts and investors via a  prospectus . This information can usually be found easily on the fund's webpage as well. 
 Obtain the total costs from the prospectus, which can be more challenging since the TER accounts for all costs associated with operating the investment fund, including trading costs, management costs, and overhead and administration costs (such as  12b-1 fees , which are the costs of marketing the fund). 
 
 
    Understanding Operating Expenses    
  Operating expenses, or  operating costs , cover any outgoing financial obligations associated with the management of the fund and the corresponding transactions. This can include employee compensation and brokerage fees, in addition to any  accountant  fees.
 
 
  Other common expenses include  shareholder  communications and  financial statements , record-keeping mechanisms, and custodial services from the overseeing organization or asset manager.
 
 
  A small percentage of the TER may be directed to other business operation costs. This can include expenses as simple as space rental and utilities for the business. Often, these expenses are referred to as  overhead  and include any financial obligation that is not necessarily directed to the actual production of a good or service.
 
 
    How Does the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Differ From the Gross Expense Ratio (GER)?    
  The  gross expense ratio (GER)  is the total percentage of a mutual fund’s assets that are devoted to running the fund. In some cases, a fund may have agreements in place for waiving, reimbursing, or recouping some of the fund’s fees. This is often the case for new funds. An investment company and its fund managers may agree to waive certain fees following the launch of a new fund to keep the expense ratio lower for investors.
 
 
  The TER represents the  fees  charged to the fund after any waivers, reimbursements, and recoupments have been made. These fee reductions are typically for a specified time frame, after which the fund may incur all full costs.
 
 
    What Are the Limitations of the TER?    
  The TER is meant to capture the entire cost that an investor can expect","By

 Definition 
 Free on Board is a shipping term for the point in the supply chain when a buyer or seller becomes liable for the goods being transported. 
  Free on Board (FOB) is a shipment term that defines the point in the  supply chain  when a buyer or seller becomes liable for the goods transported. Purchase orders between buyers and sellers set FOB terms and help determine ownership, risk, and transportation costs.
 
 
  This centuries-old shipping term has evolved into a critical concept of determining reliability and ownership transfer. The internationalization of markets and technological progress in logistics, distribution, and communication mean this affects almost every product consumers buy.
 
 
  By specifying whether goods are shipped FOB Origin or FOB Destination, companies clearly define where and when they bear the costs and risks associated with transportation. This impacts prices and how and when goods are transported and has significant implications for insurance, customs duties, and legal disputes.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Free on Board (FOB) indicates when the ownership of goods transfers from buyer to seller and who is liable for goods damaged or destroyed during shipping. FOB Origin means the buyer assumes all risk once the seller ships the product. FOB Destination means the seller retains the risk of loss until the goods reach the buyer. FOB terms impact inventory, shipping, and insurance costs.

    Understanding FOB Shipping    
  FOB is a widely used shipping term that applies to both domestic and international transactions. It's an agreement between the buyer and seller that specifies when the ownership and liability for the goods being shipped transfer from the seller to the buyer. FOB terms are typically included in shipping orders and contracts, detailing the time and place of delivery, payment terms, and which party handles freight costs and insurance.
 
 
 
 
  FOB conditions are defined in the  purchase order  between the vendor and the client. While FOB status doesn't determine ownership (which is in the bill of sale or separate agreement), it does say which party assumes responsibility for the shipment at different points in the journey. The two main types of FOB are:

   FOB Origin : The buyer takes responsibility for the goods as soon as they leave the seller's location. The buyer bears the costs and risks associated with transportation from that point forward. FOB Destination : The seller retains responsibility for the goods until they reach the buyer's destination. The seller bears the costs and risks associated with transportation up to that point. 
 
 
  Whether the transaction is domestic or international, FOB conditions influence inventory management, shipping costs, and insurance requirements. This is especially important for shippers to watch as costs have risen and fallen sharply in recent years:

Market Share: What It Is and Formula,"Definition 
 Market share is the the percent of total sales a company makes in relation to a broader industry. 
    What Is Market Share?    
  Market share is calculated by dividing the company's sales over a certain period by the industry's total sales during the same period. This metric is used to give a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and competitors. The market leader in an industry is the company with the largest market share.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Market share is the percentage of an industry's total sales over a certain period that a particular company can claim. It is calculated by dividing total company sales by total industry sales.  Market share provides a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and competitors. Growing market share can be a sign of success, while falling market share may mean the opposite. Ways to increase market share include implementing new technologies, generating customer loyalty, and acquiring competitors. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Market share is a key indicator of a company's competitiveness. 
 Investopedia / Candra Huff 
 
    Calculating Market Share    
  A company's market share is its portion of total sales in relation to the market or industry in which it operates. To calculate a company's market share, first determine the period you want to examine. It could be a quarter, a year, or multiple years.
 
 
  Next, calculate the company's total sales over that period. Then, find out the total sales for the company's industry. Finally, divide the company's total revenues by its industry's total sales.
 
 
  For example, if an American company sold $100 million worth of tractors last year domestically, and total tractor sales in the U.S. amounted to $200 million, the company's market share would be 50%.
 
 
 
 
  The calculation for market share is usually done for specific countries or regions, e.g., North America or Canada. Investors can obtain market share data from various independent sources, such as trade groups and regulatory bodies, and often from the company itself; however, some industries are harder to measure accurately than others. It is also easier to have sales data of public companies than private ones.
 
 
  The challenges to calculating market share are even bigger when companies are not pure players in industries and operate in intersections, as is the case for most big tech companies in the last two decades. In those cases, the market share will be calculated for each product and not company wise.
 
 
    Formula for Market Share    
   Market Share = Total Company Sales Total Industry Sales \begin{aligned}\text{Market Share}=\frac{\text{Total Company Sales}}{\text{Total Industry Sales}}\end{aligned} Market Share = Total Industry Sales Total Company Sales ​ ​ 
 
 
    Importance of Market Share    
  Investors and financial analysts monitor  increases and decreases in market share  carefully, as this can be a sign of the relative competitiveness of the company's products or services.
 
 
  As the total market for a product or service grows, a company that is maintaining its market share is growing revenues at the same rate as the total market. A company that is growing its market share will be growing its revenues faster than its competitors.
 
 
  Market share increases can allow a company to achieve greater scale with its operations and improve profitability. A company can try to expand its market share by lowering prices, advertising its products, or introducing new or different products. It can also grow the size of its market share by appealing to other audiences or  demographics .
 
 
  A large market share also gives a company power over its suppliers. This allows it to negotiate better terms, with the idea of reducing costs, which can increase profits or be passed to consumers via lower prices, which may increase demand, further improving market share.
 
 
   Important 
 Gains or losses in market share can have a significant impact on a company's stock performance, depending on industry conditions. 
 
 
 
    Market Share Impact    
  Changes in market share have a more important meaning in the performance of companies in mature and traditional industries, where there is known and steady growth in line with the general economy.
 
 
  In contrast, changes in market share have less importance with companies operating in  growth industries . In these industries, the total pie is still growing, so companies can still be growing sales even if they are losing market share.
 
 
  For companies in this situation, stock performance is affected more by customer and sales growth, as well as profit margins, if applicable, than by market share.
 
 
  In  cyclical industries , which are highly sensitive to the economy's ups and downs, competition for market share can be brutal. In these industries, companies may be willing to lose money on products temporarily to force competitors to give up or declare",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"Holding Company: What It Is, Advantages and Disadvantages","Definition 
 A holding company controls subsidiary firms through majority stock ownership. 
  A holding company is a parent company that owns and oversees other businesses. Instead of making products or providing services, it focuses on managing subsidiary businesses and brands while maintaining control through its voting stock. This allows the parent company to exercise control without participating in day-to-day operations.
 
 
  Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) is a holding company that owns Google and several other technology companies, such as Nest, Waymo, Deepmind, and Fitbit. While Google continues its operations in search, advertising, and other internet services, Alphabet manages the overall corporate strategy and assets across its portfolio of companies.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Holding companies own and control other businesses, providing centralized oversight. Subsidiary companies are typically run by their own management teams. Holding companies offer strategic flexibility and tax advantages through diversified investments and capital allocation. There are different types of holding companies, from pure holding companies to mixed and financial models. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia 
 
    What Is a Holding Company?    
  Holding companies as we know them got their start during America's Industrial Revolution. Railroad magnates like J.P. Morgan pioneered this organizational model to consolidate control over various railway lines while maintaining separate operating entities. 1  Soon, Standard Oil and U.S. Steel used holding company structures to dominate entire sectors of the economy.
 
 
  By owning  controlling stakes  in multiple companies, a parent firm could enjoy competitive advantages that would be impossible for a single firm. The approach gained added prominence during the trust-busting era of the early 20th century when companies sought legal ways to maintain scale and efficiency without running afoul of new  antitrust regulations . 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Here's how it works: The holding company buys enough shares (usually more than half) of other companies to call the shots on major decisions. This control doesn't require the holding company to engage in the daily operations of these businesses. Instead, the holding company sets strategic goals, appoints board members, and oversees major financial decisions. The parent company might also provide centralized services like financial management and legal counsel.
 
 
  The subsidiaries often run independently, often retaining their own management teams to handle everyday business tasks. This division of labor allows the parent company to benefit from the performance of its subsidiaries without the need to manage operations.
 
 
  A well-known holding company is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRK.A ), led by the legendary investor  Warren Buffett . Berkshire Hathaway has a broad portfolio of businesses, ranging from those in insurance to food and beverage to railroads. 3 
 
 
   Important 
 Businesses that are 100% owned by a holding company are called “ wholly owned subsidiaries ,"" while holding companies may also own smaller but controlling interests in other subsidiaries. 
 
 
 
    Types of Holding Companies    
 
 Pure holding   companies  are the simplest to understand because they do just one thing: own and manage other companies. They don't make anything or sell services themselves; they're just for running a family of companies. 
 Mixed holding companies  combine ownership of other companies with their own operational activities. For instance, Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) acts as an operating company producing software and services while holding significant ownership stakes and controlling interests in other technology companies. 
 Immediate holding companies  are like a direct parent. They own another company directly, with no middle management involved. 
 Intermediate holding companies  serve as middle-tier entities within larger corporate structures. Multinational organizations often use this structure to  save on taxes  and manage regional operations. Intermediates thus own local subsidiaries while being owned by a parent company. 
 Industry-specific   holding companies  focus on one industry they know well. For instance, in the media and entertainment sector,  Comcast Corporation  is a holding company for NBCUniversal, Xumo, SkyNews, and Telemundo.  Financial holding companies , which are regulated differently from others, typically own multiple banking, financial, or insurance institutions. 
 
 
    Holding Companies vs. Conglomerates    
  A holding company is primarily a legal and financial structure that owns controlling interests in other companies, while a  conglomerate  typically implies operational involvement across diverse business lines. Many holding companies are conglomerates, but not all conglomerates organize themselves as pure holding companies.

"NINJA Loan: Definition, History, Current Availability","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a NINJA Loan?    
  A NINJA loan is a slang term for a loan extended to a borrower with little or no attempt by the lender to verify the applicant's ability to repay. It stands for ""no income, no job, and no assets."" Whereas most lenders require loan applicants to provide evidence of a stable stream of income or sufficient  collateral , a NINJA loan ignores that verification process. 1 
 
 
  NINJA loans were more common prior to the 2008 financial crisis. In the aftermath of the crisis, the U.S. government issued new regulations to improve standard lending practices across the credit market, which included tightening the requirements for granting loans. 2  At this point, NINJA loans are rare, if not extinct.
 
 
   Key Takeaways: 
 A NINJA (no income, no job, and no assets) loan is a term describing a loan extended to a borrower who may have no ability to repay the loan. A NINJA loan is extended with no verification of a borrower's assets. NINJA loans largely disappeared after the U.S. government issued new regulations to improve standard lending practices after the 2008 financial crisis. Some NINJA loans offer attractive low interest rates that increase over time. They were popular because they could be obtained quickly and without the borrower having to provide documentation. 
 
    How a NINJA Loan Works    
  Financial institutions that offered NINJA loans base their decision on a borrower’s  credit score  with no verification of income or assets, such as through income tax returns, pay stubs, or bank and brokerage statements. Borrowers must have a credit score over a certain threshold to qualify. Since NINJA loans are generally provided through  subprime lenders , however, their credit score requirements may be lower than those of mainstream lenders, such as major banks.
 
 
  NINJA loans are structured with varying terms. Some may offer an attractively low initial interest rate that increases over time. Borrowers are required to repay the debt according to a scheduled time frame. Failing to make those payments can cause the lender to take legal action to collect the debt, resulting in a drop in the borrower's credit score and ability to obtain other loans in the future.
 
 
 
 
    Risks of NINJA Loans    
  Because NINJA loans require so little paperwork compared to, for example, traditional home mortgages or business loans, an application is processed quickly. Their speedy delivery makes them appealing to some borrowers, particularly those who lack the customary documentation or don't wish to produce it.
 
 
  The loans can, however, be very risky for the lender. Because NINJA loans require no evidence of collateral, they are not secured by any assets that a lender could seize if the borrower defaults on the loan.
 
 
  NINJA loans are also risky for the borrower, unfettered as they are by the traditionally conservative bank underwriting practices that often keep both sides out of trouble. Borrowers may be encouraged to take out larger loans than they can reasonably expect to repay, particularly if they focus on a low introductory interest rate that will rise in the future.
 
 
   Important 
 NINJA loans can be extremely risky for borrowers and lenders alike. 
 
 
 
    NINJA Loans and the Financial Crisis    
  After a high level of loan defaults helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis and a crash in real estate values in many parts of the country, the government imposed stricter rules on lenders, making loans more highly regulated than before, with mortgage loans seeing the greatest impact. 2 
 
 
  The 2010  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  created new standards for lending and loan applications. The new rules largely did away with NINJA loans, requiring lenders to obtain more comprehensive information about prospective borrowers, including their credit scores and documented evidence of their employment and other income sources.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The proliferation of NINJA loans was a contributing factor in the  2007–2008 financial crisis  and  housing bubble . One research paper estimated that such loans accounted for $100 billion, or 20% of total losses, tallied during the crisis. 3 
 
 
 
   Are NINJA Loans Still Available? 
 NINJA loans have largely ceased to exist in the United States due to tighter lending standards put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. 
 
 
   Why Did Banks Offer NINJA Loans? 
 Prior to the financial crisis, banks became greedy in profiting from writing home loans. NINJA loans were originally designed for borrowers who had difficulty producing the necessary paperwork to verify their income and assets, such as prior tax returns because they derived their income from untraditional sources where such documentation is unavailable (e.g., tips or a personal business). Lenders often extended these loans to borrowers based purely on their credit scores, without any further documentation of the individual’s ability to ma","By

 Definition 
 A leverage ratio indicates the amount of debt a company or institution carries compared to its assets or equity. 
    What Is a Leverage Ratio?    
  A leverage ratio is a measurement used to determine the relationship between a company's debt and assets. It can be used to measure the amount of capital in the form of debt and loans, or to assess a company's ability to meet its financial obligations.
 
 
  Leverage ratios are important in business, finance, and economics because companies and institutions rely on a mixture of equity and debt to finance their operations. Knowing the amount of debt held is useful in evaluating whether it can be paid off as it comes due. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A leverage ratio is a type of financial measurement used in finance, business, and economics to evaluate the level of debt relative to another financial metric. A leverage ratio may also be used to measure a company’s mix of operating expenses to get an idea of how changes in output will affect operating income. Common leverage ratios include the debt-equity ratio, equity multiplier, degree of financial leverage, and consumer leverage ratio. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Laura Porter / Investopedia 
 
    How Does a Leverage Ratio Work?    
  Leverage ratios assess the ability of a company, institution, or individual to meet their financial obligations. Carrying too much debt can be dangerous for a company and its investors, but the debt may help fuel growth if a company’s operations can generate a higher rate of return than the interest rate on its loans.
 
 
  Uncontrolled debt levels can lead to credit downgrades or even worse consequences. However, too few debts can also raise questions. A reluctance or inability to borrow may indicate that operating margins are tight. 
 
 
   Important 
 Several ratios can be categorized as leverage ratios. The main factors considered are debt, equity, assets, and interest expenses. 
 
 
 
  A leverage ratio might also be used to measure a company’s mix of  operating expenses  to get an idea of how changes in output will affect operating income. Operating costs can be fixed or variable. The mix will differ depending on the company and the industry.

    Banks and Leverage Ratios    
  Banks are among the most leveraged institutions in the United States. The combination of fractional-reserve banking and  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)  protection has produced a banking environment with limited lending risks. The FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) review and restrict the leverage ratios for American banks. 1 
 
 
  These bodies restrict how much money a bank can lend relative to how much capital the bank devotes to its own assets. The level of capital is important because banks can ""write down"" the capital portion of their assets if total asset values drop. Assets financed by debt can't be written down because the bank's bondholders and depositors are owed these funds.
 
 
  The Federal Reserve created guidelines for bank holding companies, but these restrictions vary depending on the rating assigned to the bank. Banks that experience rapid growth or face operational or financial difficulties are generally required to maintain higher leverage ratios. 2

    What Is an Overdraft?    
  An overdraft occurs when there isn't enough money in an account to cover a transaction or withdrawal, but the bank allows the transaction anyway. Essentially, it's an extension of  credit  from the financial institution that is granted when an account reaches zero.
 
 
  The overdraft allows the account holder to continue withdrawing money even when the account has no funds in it or has insufficient funds to cover the amount of the withdrawal.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An overdraft occurs when an account lacks the funds to cover a withdrawal, but the bank allows the transaction to go through anyway. The overdraft allows the customer to continue paying bills even when there is insufficient money in their account. Many banks impose additional fees or penalties for overdrawn accounts. An overdraft is like any other loan: The account holder pays interest on it and will typically be charged a one-time insufficient funds fee. Overdraft protection is provided by some banks to customers when their account reaches zero; it avoids insufficient funds charges, but often includes interest and other fees. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight 
 
    Understanding Overdrafts    
  With an overdraft account, a bank is covering payments a customer has made that would otherwise be rejected, or, in the case of actual physical checks, would  bounce  and be returned without payment. Basically, an overdraft means that the bank allows customers to borrow a set amount of money. There is interest on the loan, and there is typically a fee per overdraft. At some banks, an overdraft fee can run upwards of $37. 1 
 
 
  As with any loan, the borrower pays interest on the outstanding balance of an overdraft loan. Often, the  interest on the loan is lower  than the interest on credit cards, making the overdraft a better short-term option in an  emergency . 2  In many cases, there are additional fees for using overdraft protection that reduce the amount available to  cover your checks , such as  insufficient funds fees  per check or withdrawal.
 
 
 
 
  While banks can charge overdraft fees, they can't change the order of a customer's transactions to collect more overdraft fees. In 2010, Wells Fargo was fined $203 million for the predatory practice of structuring customer withdrawals in a way that maximized overdraft fees. 3

 In 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found some financial institutions charged unfair overdraft fees by authorizing an ATM or debit transaction made when the customer had a positive balance, but later charging an overdraft fee because intervening transactions went through before the debit settled. The CFPB found customers couldn't reasonably avoid these surprise fees. It told the banks and credit unions to stop charging overdraft fees in these situations, and a number of them have come up with plans to refund customers who were charged the fees in the past. 4 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Your bank can opt to use its own funds to cover your overdraft. 5  Another option is to link the overdraft to a credit card.

"January Effect: What It Is in the Stock Market, Possible Causes","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The January effect is the supposed increase in stock prices in the first month of the year. 
  The January effect is the name given to the belief in a seasonal increase in stock prices in the first month of each year. People have generally attributed a supposed rally each January to the rise in buying that follows the price drop that typically happens each December. However, data for this phenomenon over the last several decades has proven inconclusive. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The January effect is the supposed seasonal tendency for stocks to rise in the first month of the year. The January effect is said to occur when investors sell losing stocks in December for tax-loss harvesting and repurchase them after the New Year. Like other market anomalies and calendar effects where sentiment and nonrational motives appear at work, the January effect is considered by some as evidence against the efficient markets hypothesis. 
 
  The argument for the effect is that at the end of each year, investors tend to sell off securities at a loss to offset their capital gains and lower their tax bills, prompting a sell-off. After the New Year, they repurchase the stocks, creating a greater demand for a range of shares in the market, leading to the January effect. 1 2  Another explanation for the phenomenon is that investors use year-end cash bonuses to buy investments the following month.
 
 
  While this market anomaly has been identified in the past, the January effect has disappeared in recent years, if it ever existed, and studies of previous eras have shown it correlated less with lower prices in December than with continuing bullishness during the last months of the previous year. 1  In short, the evidence doesn't seem to match the explanations.
 
 
  Rebecca Walser, named by Investopedia as a top advisor for 2023, doesn't think there's much to the theory. But, she added, if there's anything to it, she would ""attribute it much more to human psychology than tax loss harvesting or mutual fund window dressing.""
 
 
  Another Investopedia top advisor,  Preston D. Cherry , agrees with Walser, calling it little more than ""a folktale."" But Cherry said there was much to learn from the supposed ""effect"": ""Investors must follow a disciplined and tailored investment strategy unique to their goals, risk tolerance and capacity,"" he told Investopedia. ""The best long-term investment strategies have a consistent commitment and a why attached to the action rather than following the herd.""

    Understanding the January Effect    
  Investment banker Sidney Wachtel is said to have first noticed the January effect in 1942. 3  Like all calendar-related effects, the hypothesis suggests that the markets are inefficient since efficient markets would naturally make this effect disappear.
 
 
  Our own look back at the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) since its 1993 inception makes one wonder how the term ever came to be used. Of the 31 years since, there have been 18 winning January months (58%) and 13 losing January months (42%), making the odds of a gain slightly higher than the flip of a coin. 4 2  Further, from the start of the 2009 market rally through January 2024, January months showed eight positive vs. eight losing months, a 46% to 54% ratio. Given the strong rally since 2009, one might rightly expect a more pronounced number of January winners, but this has not been the case.
 
 
  The first month of the year turns out not to be a particularly compelling trading month out of the year, with middling performance at best. Historically, according to data cited by Nasdaq, it's been in positive territory but ranks eighth out of the 12 months over the last 20 years. 2 
 
 
   Tip 
 The  efficient market hypothesis  argues that share prices reflect all the information that is available to the market. Based on the theory, since all market participants have access to the same information, outperforming the market through stock selection or market timing is not practical. The efficient market hypothesis is an argument against seasonal phenomena like the January effect. 
 
 
 
    January Effect Explanations    
  Besides tax-loss harvesting with post-New Year repurchases and investors putting cash bonuses into the market, another explanation for the January effect has to do with investor psychology. Some investors argue that January is the best month to begin an investment program or that many are following through on a New Year's resolution to begin investing for the future. 3 
 
 
  Others have posited that mutual fund managers buy the stocks of top performers at the end of the year and get rid of losi","By

What Are Penny Stocks?,"What Is a Penny Stock?    
  A penny stock typically refers to the stock of a small company that trades for less than $5 per share. Though some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the  New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE), most trade via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions through the electronic  OTC Bulletin Board  (OTCBB) or through the privately-owned  OTC Markets Group .
 
 
  There is no trading floor for OTC transactions. Quotations are also all done electronically.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A penny stock refers to a small company's stock that typically trades for less than $5 per share.  Although some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the NYSE, most penny stocks trade over the counter through the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). While there can be sizable gains in trading penny stocks, there are also equal risks of losing a significant amount of an investment in a short period. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Ryan Oakley 
 
    Understanding Penny Stocks    
  In the past, penny stocks were considered any stocks that traded for less than one dollar per share. The U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) has modified the definition to include all shares trading below five dollars. The SEC is an independent federal government agency responsible for protecting investors by maintaining the proper and orderly functioning of the  securities  markets.
 
 
  Penny stocks are usually associated with small companies with a lack of liquidity, meaning that there are few ready buyers in the marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to sell stock since there may not be enough buyers. Because of the low liquidity, investors might have difficulty finding a price that accurately reflects the market.
 
 
  Due to their lack of liquidity, wide bid-ask spreads or price quotes, and small company sizes, penny stocks are generally considered highly speculative. In other words, investors could lose a sizable amount or all of their investment.

    Penny Stock Volatility    
  Penny stocks often represent growing companies with limited cash and resources. Since these are primarily small companies, penny stocks are most suitable for investors who have a  high tolerance for risk .
 
 
  Typically, penny stocks have a higher level of volatility, resulting in a higher potential for reward and, thus, a higher level of inherent risk. Investors may lose their entire investment on a penny stock, or more than their investment if they  buy on margin , which means the investor borrowed funds from a bank or broker to purchase the shares.
 
 
  Investors should consider the heightened risks associated with penny stocks. For example, an investor should have a  stop-loss order  predetermined before entering a trade and know what price level to exit if the market moves against them. Stop-loss orders set a price limit that, once reached, will trigger an automatic sale of the securities.
 
 
  Although penny stocks can have explosive gains, it is essential to have realistic expectations and understand that penny stocks are high-risk investments with low trading volumes.
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of Penny Stocks    
  Due to their low volume, penny stocks tend to be more volatile than established equities. This means high opportunities for both gains and losses, and investors should be careful to understand both the risks and benefits.
 
 
    Funding for Small Companies    
  Penny stocks do provide some small businesses with a way to access funding from the public. These companies may use this platform as a starting block to move into a larger marketplace.
 
 
    High Potential for Growth    
  Also, since they sell at such low prices, there is room for significant upside. Some companies, such as Amazon ( AMZN ) originated as penny stocks but later grew into sizable  blue-chip  companies.
 
 
  A blue chip is a nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound company. Blue chips generally sell high-quality, widely accepted products and services. Blue-chip companies typically have a history of weathering downturns and operate profitably  in the face of adverse economic conditions , which helps to contribute to their long record of stable and reliable growth.
 
 
  However, some factors exacerbate the risk associated with investing in or trading penny stocks. These securities are usually riskier than more established companies.

 Qualitative analysis explores a company’s nonnumerical data, helping it understand its value or prospects. 
    What Is Qualitative Analysis?    
  In business and management, qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to analyze a company’s value or prospects based on nonquantifiable information, such as management expertise, industry cycles, strength of research and development, and labor relations.
 
 
  Qualitative analysis contrasts with  quantitative analysis , which focuses on numbers found in reports such as balance sheets. The two techniques, however, will often be used together to examine a company’s operations and evaluate its potential as an investment opportunity.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment based on “soft” or nonquantifiable data. Qualitative analysis deals with intangible and inexact information that can be difficult to collect and measure. Machines struggle to conduct qualitative analysis, as intangibles can’t be defined by numeric values. Understanding people and company cultures is central to qualitative analysis. Looking at a company through the eyes of a customer and understanding its competitive advantage both assist with qualitative analysis. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Qualitative analysis can be conducted by anthropologists. sociologists, and researchers in applied fields like education or public health. 
 Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Qualitative Analysis    
  The distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches is similar to the difference between human and artificial intelligence. Quantitative analysis uses exact inputs such as profit margins,  debt ratios , earnings multiples, and the like. These can be plugged into a computerized model to yield an exact result, such as the  fair value  of a stock or a forecast for earnings growth. Of course, for the time being, a human has to write the program that crunches these numbers, and that involves a fair degree of subjective judgment. Once they are programmed, though, computers can perform quantitative analysis in fractions of a second, while it might take even the most gifted and highly trained humans minutes or hours.
 
 
  Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, deals with intangible, inexact concerns that belong to the social and experiential realm rather than the mathematical one. This approach depends on the kind of intelligence that machines currently lack, since things like positive associations with a brand, management trustworthiness, customer satisfaction,  competitive advantage , and cultural shifts are difficult, arguably impossible, to capture with numerical inputs.
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Many  social scientists  use qualitative analysis in their research, and it is especially prominent among anthropologists and sociologists. 
 
 
 
    Understanding People Through Qualitative Analysis    
  Qualitative analysis may sound almost like “listening to your gut,” and indeed, many qualitative analysts would argue that gut feelings have their place in the process. This does not mean, however, that it is not a rigorous approach. Indeed, it can consume much more time and energy than quantitative analysis.
 
 
  People are central to qualitative analysis. An investor might start by getting to know a  company’s management , including their educational and professional backgrounds. One of the most important factors is their experience in the industry. More abstractly, do they have a record of hard work and prudent decision making, or are they better at knowing—or being related to—the right people?

 The term unicorn refers to a privately held startup company with a value of over $1 billion. 
    Unicorn Startups: Overview    
  In the language of venture capital, a unicorn is a startup company with a valuation exceeding $1 billion. They are usually found in sectors like technology that require massive capital to bring products to market. 
 
 
  These privately held startups are expected to defy traditional growth metrics, leveraging cutting-edge or potentially ""paradigm-shifting"" advances to achieve rapid market penetration and exponential growth.
 
 
  Successful unicorns have included companies that are now household names, such as Airbnb Inc. ( ABNB ). Unicorns that have turned out to be mythical beasts include Theranos, the medical technology company that collapsed when its claims turned out to be false.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 
 Unicorns are private startup companies that have obtained at least $1 billion in financing based on their perceived potential for huge success. 
 Some notable former unicorns include Uber Technologies Inc. ( UBER ), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), and Maplebear Inc. ( CART ), better known as Instacart. 
 Investing in unicorns involves high risks and potentially high rewards. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin 
 
    Unicorns, Real and Imaginary    
  Venture capitalist Aileen Lee popularized the term in the early 2010s. ""I used the word 'unicorn' because it is ... kind of magical, that takes some alchemy, some great timing—a lot of things have to come together. It’s not easy,"" she said. 1  ""The vast majority of companies that are venture-funded and [have] people who are super smart and have great intentions and build great products, they don’t actually reach that level of valuation. It’s a pretty hard thing to do."" 
 
 
 
 
  Yet, despite Lee's definition, some of the unicorns of recent years have been less magical than fantastical. They are billion-dollar firms whose values were based more on hype—and occasionally outright fraud—than fundamentals and traditional risk analysis.
 
 
  They are not as rare as the mythical creature, either. CB Insights puts the number of unicorn firms worldwide at about 1,200 in 2024, while Crunchbase lists over 1,400. 2 3 
 
 
  Some successful unicorn startups have included Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX, and Palantir Technologies Inc. ( PLTR ). 
 
 
  Some of the donkeys dressed up like unicorns have included  Theranos ,  WeWork , and Quibi. 
 
 
    When Unicorns Were Born    
  A unicorn is defined as a privately owned startup valued at over $1 billion. 4  To become unicorns, companies must have an idea that appears innovative and marketable, a clear vision for growth, and a strong pitch to present to venture capitalists and private investors.
 
 
  Aileen Lee, founder of Palo Alto-based Cowboy Ventures, a seed-stage  venture capital fund , coined the term. 4  Reviewing software startups founded in the 2000s, she estimated that only 0.07% ever reached a $1 billion valuation. According to Lee, startups that reach this mark are so rare that finding one is as difficult as finding a mythical unicorn. 4 
 
 
  Lee also argued that the first unicorns weren't the formed-in-a-garage tech firms of the 1970s or the even earlier private venture firms of the 1950s but the products of the 1990s. Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG )—then Google—she noted, was the clear super-unicorn of the group, earning the moniker with a valuation of more than $100 billion.
 
 
  More unicorns arrived in the 2000s, with Meta Platforms ( META ), formerly Facebook, emerging as the decade's super-unicorn. 4  Oth","0 seconds of 1 minute, 43 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unicorn.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
Internal Rate of Return: An Inside Look,"Close 
 
 
 
  The internal rate of return (IRR) is frequently used by companies to analyze profit centers and decide between capital projects. But this budgeting metric can also help you evaluate certain financial events in your own life, like mortgages and investments.
 
 
  The  IRR  is the interest rate (also known as the  discount rate ) that will bring a series of cash flows (positive and negative) to a  net present value (NPV)  of zero (or to the current value of cash invested). Using IRR to obtain net  present value  is known as the  discounted cash flow method  of financial analysis.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The internal rate of return (IRR) is the interest rate that will bring the net present value of a series of cash flows to zero.  Corporations use IRR to estimate the present value of future cash flows from a potential investment. IRR calculations can be very complex, but can easily be calculated using accounting software or spreadsheet programs like Excel.  
 
    Uses of Internal Rate of Return (IRR)    
  As we mentioned above, IRR is a key tool in corporate finance. For example, a corporation will evaluate investing in a new plant versus extending an existing plant based on the IRR of each project. In such a case, each new  capital project  must produce an IRR that is higher than the company's  cost of capital . Once this hurdle is surpassed, the project with the highest IRR would be the wiser investment, all other things being equal (including risk).
 
 
  IRR is also useful for corporations in evaluating stock  buyback  programs. Clearly, if a company allocates a substantial amount to a repurchasing its shares, the analysis must show that the company's own stock is a better investment—that is, has a higher IRR—than any other use of the funds, such as creating new outlets or acquiring other companies.
 
 
    Calculation of Internal Rate of Return    
  The IRR  formula can be very complex  depending on the timing and variances in  cash flow  amounts. Without a computer or financial calculator, IRR can only be computed by trial and error. The  Excel IRR function  can help you accomplish this task much easier. 
 One of the disadvantages of using IRR is that all cash flows are assumed to be reinvested at the same discount rate, although in the real world, these rates will fluctuate, particularly with longer-term projects. IRR can be useful, however, when comparing projects of equal risk, rather than as a fixed return projection. 
 The general formula for IRR that includes net present value is: 
 0 = C F 0 + C F 1 ( 1 + I R R ) + C F 2 ( 1 + I R R ) 2 + … + C F n ( 1 + I R R ) n = N P V = ∑ n = 0 N C F n ( 1 + I R R ) n where: C F 0 = Initial investment/outlay C F 1 , C F 2 , … , C F n = Cash flows n = Each period N = Holding period N P V = Net present value I R R = Internal rate of return \begin{aligned} 0 &= CF_0 + \frac{CF_1}{(1 + IRR)} + \frac{CF_2}{(1 + IRR)^2} + \dotso + \frac{CF_n}{(1 + IRR)^n} \\ &= NPV = \sum^N_{n = 0} \frac{CF_n}{(1 + IRR)^n} \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &CF_0=\text{Initial investment/outlay}\\ &CF_1, CF_2, \dotso, CF_n=\text{Cash flows}\\ &n=\text{Each period}\\ &N=\text{Holding period}\\ &NPV=\text{Net present value}\\ &IRR=\text{Internal rate of return}\\ \end{aligned} 0 ​ = C F 0 ​ + ( 1 + I R R ) C F 1 ​ ​ + ( 1 + I R R ) 2 C F 2 ​ ​ + … + ( 1 + I R R ) n C F n ​ ​ = N P V = n = 0 ∑ N ​ ( 1 + I R R ) n C F n ​ ​ where: C F 0 ​ = Initial investment/outlay C F 1 ​ , C F 2 ​ , … , C F n ​ = Cash flows n = Each period N = Holding period N P V = Net present value I R R = Internal rate of return ​

   Warning 
 IRR calculations do not account for the riskiness of a proposed investment. 
 
 
 
    Example of Internal Rate of Return Calculation    
  The simplest example of computing an IRR is by taking one from everyday life: a  mortgage  with even payments. Assume an initial mortgage amount of $200,000 and monthly payments of $1,050 for 30 years. The IRR (or implied interest rate) on this loan annually is 4.8%.
 
 
  Because the stream of payments is equal and spaced at even intervals, an alternative approach is to discount these payments at a 4.8% interest rate, which will produce a net present value of $200,000. Alternatively, if the payments are raised to, say $1,100, the IRR of that loan will rise to 5.2%.
 
 
  Here's how the above formula for IRR works using this example:
 
 
   The initial payment (CF 1 ) is $200,000 (a positive inflow) Subsequent cash flows (CF 2 , CF 3 , CF n ) are negative $1,050 (negative because it is being paid out) Number of payments (N) is 30 years x 12 = 360 monthly payments Initial Investment is $200,000 IRR is 4.8% divided by 1","By

"Key Rate Duration: Definition, What It Calculates, and Formula","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Key Rate Duration?    
  Key rate duration measures how the value of a debt security or a debt instrument portfolio, generally bonds, changes at a specific maturity point along the entirety of the yield curve. When keeping other maturities constant, the key rate duration is used to measure the sensitivity in a debt security's price to a 1% change in yield for a specific maturity.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The key rate duration calculates the change in a bond's price in relation to a 100-basis-point (1%) change in the yield for a given maturity. When a yield curve has a parallel shift, you can use effective duration, but key rate duration must be used when the yield curve moves in a non-parallel manner, to estimate portfolio value changes. Duration measures tell you the price risk involved in holding fixed income securities given a change in interest rates. 
 
    The Formula for Key Rate Duration    
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Key Rate Duration formula. 
 Investopedia  
 
  Where:
 
 
   P -  = a security's price after a 1%  decrease  in its yield P +  = a security's price after a 1%  increase  in its yield P 0  = the security's original price 
 
 
    Calculating Key Rate Duration    
  As an example, assume that a  bond  is originally priced at $1,000, and with a 1% increase in yield would be priced at $970, and with a 1% decrease in yield would be priced at $1,040. based on the formula above, the key rate duration for this bond would be:
 
 
   KRD = ( $ 1 , 0 4 0 − $ 9 7 0 ) / ( 2 × 1 % × $ 1 , 0 0 0 ) = $ 7 0 / $ 2 0 = 3 . 5 where: KRD = Key rate duration \begin{aligned} &\text{KRD}=\left(\$1,040 - \$970\right)/\left(2\times1\%\times\$1,000\right)=\$70/\$20=3.5\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{KRD = Key rate duration}\\ \end{aligned} ​ KRD = ( $ 1 , 0 4 0 − $ 9 7 0 ) / ( 2 × 1 % × $ 1 , 0 0 0 ) = $ 7 0 / $ 2 0 = 3 . 5 where: KRD = Key rate duration ​ ﻿
 
 
    What Does Key Rate Duration Tell You?    
  Key rate duration is an important concept in estimating the expected changes in value for a bond or portfolio of bonds because it does so when the  yield curve  shifts in a manner that is not perfectly parallel, which occurs often.
 
 
 
 
  Effective duration—another important bond metric—is an insightful duration measure that also calculates expected changes in price for a bond or portfolio of bonds given a 1% change in yield, but it is only valid for parallel shifts in the yield curve. This is why the key rate duration is such a valuable metric.
 
 
  Key rate duration and effective duration are related. There are 11 maturities along the Treasury  spot rate  curve, and a key rate duration may be calculated for each. The sum of all the 11 key rate durations along the portfolio's yield curve equal the  effective duration  of the portfolio.
 
 
    Example of How to Use the Key Rate Duration    
  It can be difficult to interpret an individual key rate duration because it is very unlikely that a single point on the  treasury  yield curve will have an upwards or downwards shift at a single point while all others remain constant. It's useful for looking at key rate durations across the curve and looking at the relative values of key rate durations between two securities.
 
 
  For example, assume bond X has a one-year key rate duration of 0.5 and a five-year key rate duration of 0.9. Bond Y has a key rate durations of 1.2 and 0.3 for these maturity points, respectively. It could be said that bond X is half as sensitive as bond Y on the short-term end of the curve, while bond Y is one-third as sensitive to interest rate changes on the intermediate part of the curve.

"What Is Personal Finance, and Why Is It Important?","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Personal finance is the practice of managing your money as well as saving and investing. 
    What Is Personal Finance?    
  Personal finance is the term used to describe all aspects of an individual's money management, including saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them on financial and investment opportunities.
 
 
  Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it's essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Few schools have courses on managing your money, so it is important to learn how through free online articles, courses, blogs, podcasts, or books. The core areas of managing personal finance include income, spending, savings, investments, and protection. Smart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and much more. Being disciplined is important, but it's also good to know when you shouldn't adhere to the guidelines. 
 
   
 
 
 
    The Importance of Personal Finance    
   Personal finance  is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and financial protections (insurance and estate planning).
 
 
  Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In Q3 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.8 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the second quarter of 2024 to the third: 1 
 
 
 
 
   Credit card debt : Up by $24 billion Auto debt : Up by $18 billion Student debt : Up by $21 billion Mortgage debt : Up by $75 billion Home equity line of credit : Up by $7 billion 
 
 
  Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising. 
 
 
    Areas of Personal Finance    
  The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.
 
 
    Income    
  Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.
 
 
    Spending    
  Spending is an outflow of cash and is typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever you use your income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.
 
 
  Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. You should ensure your spending is less than your income; otherwise, you won't have enough money to cover your expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high interest rates credit cards charge.
 
 
    Saving    
  Savings are the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have some savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.
 
 
  Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.
 
 
    Investing    
  Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.
 
 
  Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through reading and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.
 
 
    Protection    
  Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such","By

"Withholding Allowance: What Is It, and How Does It Work?","What Is a Withholding Allowance?    
  A withholding allowance is an exemption that reduces how much income an employer deducts from an employee’s paycheck for taxes and transmits to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on their behalf.
 
 
  This exemption from withholding is tied to the personal exemption, a federal tax break that was available to all taxpayers, regardless of their expenses, through 2017.
 
 
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 eliminated  personal exemptions  for the period from 2018 to 2025. As a result, the withholding allowance has no current practical relevance. But that could change after 2025, if the TCJA changes are not extended. 1 
 
 
  For now, it is no longer part of  Form W-4: Employee’s Withholding Certificate , which the IRS completely redesigned.
 
 
  Employees in the United States fill out and submit Form W-4 to their employers so that their employers know how much to withhold from workers' paychecks. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 A withholding allowance is an  exemption  from withholding that reduces the amount of income an employer deducts from an employee’s paycheck for income taxes. 
 The  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)  of 2017 eliminated personal exemptions and put an end to the withholding allowance. 
 Before 2018, withholding was based on the number of allowances a taxpayer claimed for themselves, their spouse, and their dependents, as well as their tax filing status. 
 The TCJA dramatically increased the standard deduction amount and the Child Tax Credit, which could offset at least part of the change related to eliminating personal exemptions. 
 IRS  Form W-4 is used to calculate withholding. Individuals should file a new Form W-4 whenever their personal or financial situation changes. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Nez Riaz 
 
    How the Withholding Allowance Worked    
  Before 2018, an individual was required to  fill out Form W-4  when hired by an employer. The form required certain personal information, such as their name,  Social Security number , and the number of allowances to be claimed. 2 1 
 
 
 
 
  The employer used the W-4 to determine how much income to subtract from an employee’s  paycheck  and remit to the tax authorities.
 
 
  The total number of allowances claimed was important—the more tax allowances claimed, the less income would be withheld from a paycheck; the fewer allowances claimed, the more income would be withheld. 3 
 
 
  The withholding amount was based on filing status—single or married but filing separately, married and filing jointly, or head of household—and the number of withholding allowances claimed on the  W-4 . 
 
 
  It was important to claim the right number of allowances to avoid paying too little in taxes or to keep from giving the government an interest-free loan by paying too much in taxes (only to receive the amount back later as a refund).
 
 
    Determining Withholding Post-2017    
  Much of how things worked before the passage of the TCJA is the same today. Individuals still fill out a W-4 which employers still use it to calculate how much income from an employee's paycheck to withhold. Tax filing status is still key.
 
 
  But the IRS simplified Form W-4 and how taxpayers should determine their withholding. Now, withholding amounts relate to whether an individual has multiple jobs or a spouse who works, what credits they can claim, and other adjustments. 4 
 
 
  For example, withholding is affected if:
 
 
 
 A taxpayer can claim the  Child Tax Credit  for a qualifying child (or a dependent who is not a qualifying child) 
 They itemize personal deductions instead of claiming the  standard deduction 
 They have additional income from dividends, interest, or retirement income 
 They (or their spouse) have more than one job 5 
 
 
   Tip 
 Fortunately, you can use the  IRS Withholding Calculator  to see whether you're having the right amount withheld from your paycheck. 
 
 
 
    Complete Exemption From Withholding    
  An individual can be completely exempt from withholding, but it’s not easy to receive that status.
 
 
  You can claim the exemption from withholding only if you had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld in the prior year because you didn’t have any  tax liability  and you expect the same for the current year. You simply write “Exempt” on Form W-4. 6 
 
 
  This must be done annually; the exemption doesn’t automatically carry over. 
 
 
    When To Redetermine Withholding    
  A new Form W-4 must be filed with a taxpayer’s employer whenever the taxpayer's personal or financial situation changes (e.g., they get married, have a baby, or their spouse enters or leaves the workplace).
 
 
  The new withholding goes into effect no later than the first payroll period ending 30 days after giving the revised form to the employer. 7  The employer may implement it sooner but isn’t required to do so.

Upside: Risk/Reward Definition and Examples,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Upside?    
  Upside refers to the potential increase in the value of an investment, portfolio, company, sector, market, or economy. Upside is measured in monetary value or percentage terms. Analysts commonly use either  technical analysis  or  fundamental analysis  techniques to predict the future price and upside of an investment, particularly when it comes to stock prices. A higher upside means that the stock has more value than is currently reflected in the stock price. Upside is the opposite of downside, which is the negative movement of an investment's price.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The upside is the potential for an investment to increase in value, as measured in terms of money or percentage. Upside is the opposite of downside, which determines the downward movement of a financial instrument's price. Analysts use fundamental or technical analysis to make predictions about movement.  The upside is essentially the draw for an investor to invest, and the upside potential is tied to how much risk the investor is willing to assume. 
 
    Understanding Upside    
  Upside refers to the predicted appreciation in the value of an investment,  financial portfolio  company, sector, market, or economy. It is the opposite of downside. Put simply, upside is a projected price increase. The concept of upside is the motivating factor for an individual to invest. The magnitude of the upside move primarily depends on the risk associated with that investment.
 
 
  The market axiom of  high risk/high reward  holds when it comes to deciding whether to commit to or pass on an investment. Investors with a high tolerance for risk typically choose investments with huge upside, while those who are risk-averse will opt for investments that have limited upside but will be more apt to preserve their initial investment value.
 
 
  Factors that can affect the upside potential for an investment or portfolio include (but aren't limited to):
 
 
 
 Market swings and  trends 
 Economic indicators 
 Company- and industry-specific news and events 
 Business dynamics 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The high risk/high reward concept corresponds with the idea of upside: the higher the risk, the more the upside of an investment. 
 
 
 
    Upside and Trading Strategies    
    Fundamental Analysis    
  Fundamental analysis evaluates the upside price of a stock by considering the ability of the investment firm to generate sales and earnings and to make effective decisions about company assets. Companies that manage their costs well and increase their  profit margins  have a higher upside.
 
 
  Businesses can increase sales by moving into new markets or by adding a product line.  Money managers  who use fundamental analysis also consider how effectively a business uses assets to generate sales and profits. 
 
 
    Technical Analysis    
  Technical analysis is a method that considers the historic patterns in the price of a stock and in the trading volume of a security.  Technical analysts  believe that price movements are trends, and these managers use charts to determine the upside in a stock’s price.
 
 
  For example, a  breakout  occurs when a stock price trades above a recent price trend. If a stock has been trading between $20 and $25 per share, for example, a price move to $28 is a breakout, which is an indication that the stock price has an upside above $28. 
 
 
    Importance of Upside    
  Upside not only refers to an investment’s potential gains in value but is also a concept used to judge the success of a portfolio manager's performance when compared to a  benchmark . For many mutual funds, the investment objective is to outperform a specific benchmark, such as the  Standard & Poor's 500 indexes . The upside capture ratio indicates how much upside the mutual fund captures when compared to the benchmark. 1 
 
 
  Upside also plays a part in  short selling , which is the sale of stock that an investor does not own. In short selling, the seller must deliver borrowed securities to the buyer by the  settlement date . Eventually, the short seller must buy the shares to cover the short position, and the seller’s goal is to buy back shares at a lower price. Short-sellers look for stocks that have reached their upside potential, which means the stock's potential to decline increases.
 
 
   What Is the Upside/Downside Ratio? 
 The upside/downside ratio is a metric used by technical analysts to determine the direction change of financial assets. More specifically, it calculates the upward versus downward volume. This ratio is calculated by dividing advancing issues (volume traded that close above their opening price) by declining issues (volume traded that close below their opening price). Analysts and investors use this ratio to understand the momentum of a financial instrument, company, market, sector, or economy at any given time. This helps identify entry and exit points to maximize gains and minimize losses.","By

Perfect Competition: Examples and How It Works,"Definition 
 Perfect competition is a market structure used in economic theory as a benchmark. In this model, there are low barriers of entry and no monopolies. 
    What Is Perfect Competition?    
  Perfect competition, also known as pure competition, is an idealized market condition in which many sellers compete to offer the best prices, and large sellers have no advantages over smaller ones. Perfect competition rarely occurs in real-world markets, but it provides a useful framework for understanding how supply and demand influence prices and behavior in a market economy.
 
 
  There are many buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market, and prices are determined purely by supply and demand. Companies earn just enough profit to stay in business and no more. Other companies would enter the market and drive profits down if they were to earn excess profits.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Perfect competition is an ideal type of market structure where all producers and consumers have full and symmetric information and no transaction costs. There are a large number of producers and consumers competing with each other in this kind of environment. Perfect competition is theoretically the opposite of a monopolistic market. All real markets exist outside of the plane of the perfect competition model, so each can be classified as imperfect. The opposite of perfect competition is imperfect competition, which exists when a market violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Jessica Olah / Investopedia 
 
    How Perfect Competition Works    
  Perfect competition is a benchmark or ideal type to which real-life market structures can be compared. Pure competition is  theoretically the opposite  of a monopoly, in which only a single firm supplies a good or service. That firm can charge whatever price it wants because consumers have no alternatives, and it's difficult for would-be competitors to enter the marketplace.
 
 
  There are no monopolies in a perfect competition model. This kind of structure has several key characteristics: 1 
 
 
 
 
   All firms sell an identical product. It's a commodity or homogeneous. All firms are price takers. They can't influence the market price of their products. Market share doesn't influence prices. Buyers have complete or perfect information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm in the past, present, and future. Capital resources and labor are perfectly mobile. Firms can enter or exit the market without cost. 
 
 
  This can be contrasted with the more realistic imperfect competition that exists whenever a hypothetical or real market violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition.
 
 
  All real markets exist outside the plane of the perfect competition model, so each can be classified as imperfect. The contemporary theory of imperfect versus perfect competition stems from the Cambridge tradition of post-classical economic thought.
 
 
    Characteristics of Perfect Competition    
  A perfectly competitive market is defined by several factors.
 
 
    A Large and Homogeneous Market     
  A large number of buyers and sellers exist in a perfectly competitive market. The sellers are small firms rather than large  corporations  that are capable of controlling prices through supply adjustments. They sell products with minimal differences in capabilities, features, and pricing. This ensures that buyers can't distinguish between products based on physical attributes, such as size or color, or intangible values, such as branding.
 
 
  A large population of both buyers and sellers ensures that supply and demand remain constant in this market. Buyers can easily substitute products made by one firm for others.
 
 
    Perfect Information Availability      
  Information about an industry's ecosystem and competition constitutes a significant advantage. Knowledge about component sourcing and supplier pricing can make or break the market for certain companies.
 
 
  Information about patents and competitors' research initiatives can help companies develop competitive strategies and build a moat around their products in certain knowledge and research-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals and technology.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The availability of free and perfect information in a perfectly competitive market ensures that each firm can produce its goods or services at the same rate and with the same production techniques as another in the market. 
 
 
 
    Absence of Controls    
  Governments play a vital role in market formation for products by imposing regulations and price controls. They can control the entry and exit of firms into a market by setting up rules to function in it. The pharmaceutical industry must contend with a roster of rules governing the development, production, and sale of drugs. 2 
 
 
  These rules require significant  capital investments  in the form of employee","By

 Definition 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tracks thirty of America's biggest and most established companies, acting like a quick temperature check of the U.S. economy.  
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. The Dow Jones is named after Charles Dow, who created the index in 1896 with his business partner, Edward Jones. Also referred to as the Dow 30, the index is considered a gauge of the broader U.S. economy. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a widely-watched benchmark index in the U.S. for blue chip stocks. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The index was created by Charles Dow in 1896 to serve as a proxy for the broader U.S. economy. 2 The DJIA's composition can change over time based on economic trends. The Dow Divisor is a constant created to address the simple average issue. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / NoNo Flores 
 
    Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)    
  The DJIA is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. The DJIA was designed to serve as a proxy for the health of the broader U.S. economy. Often referred to simply as the Dow, it is one of the most-watched stock market indexes in the world. While the Dow includes a range of companies, all can be described as  blue chip  companies with consistently stable earnings. 3 
 
 
 
 
  In the early 20th century, the performance of industrial companies was typically tied to the overall growth rate in the economy. That cemented the relationship between the Dow's performance and the overall economy. Even today, for many investors, a strong-performing Dow equals a strong economy, while a weak-performing Dow generally means a slowing economy. 2 
 
 
 
 
  As the economy changes over time, so does the index's composition. A part of the Dow may be dropped when a company becomes less relevant to current trends of the economy, to be replaced by a new name that better reflects the shift. For instance, a company may be removed from the index when its  market capitalization  drops because of financial distress. 2

  Stocks with higher share prices are given greater weight in the index. So, a higher percentage move in a higher-priced component will have a greater impact on the final calculated value. At the Dow's inception, Charles Dow calculated the average by adding the prices of the 12 Dow component stocks and dividing by 12. The result was a simple average. Over time, additions and subtractions to the index had to be accounted for, such as mergers and stock splits. At that point, a simple mean calculation no longer made sense. 4 
 
 
 
 
    The Dow Divisor and Index Calculation    
  The  Dow divisor  was created to address the simple average issue. The divisor is a predetermined constant that is used to determine the effect of a one-point move in any of the about 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. There have been instances when the divisor needed to be changed so that the value of the Dow stayed consistent. As of 2024, the Dow Divisor was 0.15265312230608. 5 
 
 
  The Dow is not calculated using a weighted arithmetic average and doesn't represent its component companies' market cap, unlike the S&P 500. Rather, it reflects the sum of the price of one share of stock for all the components, divided by the divisor. Thus, a one-point move in any of the component stocks will move the index by an identical number of points. 5 
 
 
  DJIA Price = SUM (Component Stock Prices) ÷ Dow Divisor
 
 
   Important 
 The S&P 500 has outperformed the DJIA on an annualized basis over the last three-, five-, and 10-year periods. 3 6

    What Is a Homeowners Association (HOA)?    
  A homeowners association (HOA) is an organization in a subdivision, planned community, or  condominium  building that makes and enforces rules for the properties and residents. Homeowners associations are run by a board of directors and typically collect monthly or annual fees to pay for common area maintenance and the upkeep of facilities.
 
 
  Those who purchase property within an HOA’s jurisdiction automatically become members. Some associations can be very restrictive about what members can do with their properties. Others give residents more freedom. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A homeowners association (HOA) is an organization that makes and enforces rules and guidelines for a subdivision, planned community, or condominium building. HOA members are the residents of the subdivision, community, or building. Some communities require mandatory membership for individuals who purchase property in the zone. Homeowners associations are run by a board of directors and typically collect monthly or annual fees to pay for common area maintenance and the upkeep of facilities. Homeowners associations may impose fines on noncompliant homeowners.

    How Homeowners Associations (HOAs) Work    
  Homeowners associations (HOAs) are usually formed within communities or neighborhoods of single-family homes or multiple-unit buildings such as townhomes or condominiums. An HOA is typically established to make and enforce rules regarding the  properties  within the jurisdiction.
 
 
  HOAs are composed of and run by the community’s residents. Membership is usually a requirement to buy a home within a community where an HOA has been established.
 
 
  An HOA usually has a board of directors or governors. These groups are elected to enforce and oversee the HOA’s rules and regulations. An HOA typically describes its rules as  restrictive covenants  in a document called a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs).
 
 
 
 
  CC&Rs set certain conditions for owners about the maintenance of their properties. 1  These sometimes include structural restrictions such as the type of fences or landscape allowed. They may also include more minor aesthetic choices like the color of paint on a house.
 
 
  A CC&R document may also outline the penalties for violating the guidelines in the agreement. These penalties can take the shape of  fees  or forced compliance. They can even be as drastic as litigation in some cases. 
 
 
    Homeowners Association (HOA) Fees    
  Some HOAs can wield significant financial and legal power over the property owners in their zone. HOAs collect monthly or annual  HOA fees  that depend on several factors:

"European Union (EU): What It Is, Countries, History, Purpose","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the European Union (EU)?    
  The European Union (EU) is a political and economic alliance of 27 countries. It promotes democratic values in its member nations and is one of the world's most powerful trade blocs. Nineteen of the countries share the  euro  as their official currency.
 
 
  The EU grew out of a desire to strengthen economic and political cooperation throughout the continent of Europe in the wake of World War II.
 
 
  Its  gross domestic product  (GDP) totaled 14.45 trillion euros in 2021. That's about US $15.49 trillion. The GDP of the U.S. for the same period was about US $23 trillion. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The EU is a political and economic grouping of 27 countries committed to shared democratic values. The euro is the shared official currency of 19 EU members known collectively as the eurozone. In recent years, the EU has expanded to include many of the countries that had been socialist states before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the 2016 referendum known as Brexit, the U.K. voted to leave the EU; it officially left in 2020. 3 
 
    History of the European Union    
  The EU traces its roots to the European Coal and Steel Community, which was founded in 1950 and had just six members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. It became the European Economic Community in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome and subsequently was renamed the  European Community  (EC). 4 5 
 
 
  This served to deepen the integration of the member nations' foreign, security, and internal affairs policies. The EU established a common market the same year to promote the free movement of goods, services, people, and capital across its internal borders.
 
 
  The EC initially focused on a common agricultural policy and the elimination of  customs barriers . Denmark, Ireland, and the U.K. joined in 1973 in the first wave of expansion. Direct elections to the European Parliament began in 1979. 5 
 
 
    Creation of a Common Market    
  In 1986, the Single European Act embarked on a six-year plan to create a common European market by harmonizing national regulations. 5 
 
 
 
 
  The  Maastricht Treaty  took effect in 1993, replacing the EC with the EU. The euro debuted as a common single currency for participating EU members on January 1, 1999. 6  Denmark and the U.K. negotiated ""opt-out"" provisions that permitted countries to retain their own currencies if they chose. 7 
 
 
  Several newer members of the EU have also either not yet met the criteria for adopting the euro or chosen to opt out.
 
 
    The European Debt Crisis    
  In the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the EU and the  European Central Bank  struggled to deal with high sovereign debt and sluggish growth in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece.
 
 
  Greece and Ireland received financial bailouts from the EU in 2010 conditioned on the implementation of fiscal  austerity  measures. Portugal followed in 2011. A second Greek bailout was needed in 2012. 8 
 
 
  The crisis abated after the EU and the European Central Bank adopted a series of measures to support the sovereign and banking-sector debt of the affected countries.
 
 
    Long-Term Measures    
  These included the establishment in October 2012 of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), established to assist EU members experiencing severe financial problems, including an inability to access the bond markets. The ESM supplanted the temporary European Financial Stability Facility backstop in place since 2010. 9 
 
 
  The European Central Bank conducted a series of ""targeted longer-term refinancing operations"" in 2014, 2016, and 2019 to provide financing on favorable terms for EU financial institutions. 10 
 
 
  In 2015, the EU loosened the provisions of the 2011 Stability and Growth Act requiring member states to target public debt of below 60% of gross domestic product and annual government budget deficits below 3% of GDP over the medium term. 11 
 
 
  The same year, a new EU agency, the Single Resolution Board, assumed responsibility for resolving bank failures in the euro area. 12 
 
 
    EU's North-South Issues    
  While the relief measures addressed the crisis, they haven't tackled one of its principal causes—the wide disparity in wealth and economic growth between the EU's heavily industrialized north and its poorer southern periphery, which remains less urbanized and more dependent on agriculture. 13 
 
 
  Because the industrialized north and the more rural south share a common currency, struggling southern economies can't take advantage of  currency depreciation  to improve their international competitiveness. Without currency depreciation, southern exporters ultimately struggle to compete with their northern rivals, which benefit from faster productivity growth. 14

"Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA): What It Is, Who Pays","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)?    
  The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) of 1935 established a payroll tax on U.S. wage earners' paychecks and called for matching contributions from employers. 1  The revenues from this tax finance the nation's  Social Security  program and  Medicare  program. 2 
 
 
  From the beginning, the idea behind the act was that working people would contribute a certain amount of each of their paychecks throughout their working years to fund Social Security (and later Medicare) so that, later in life, they'd be able to count on earned financial and health benefits.
 
 
  The  Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA)  of 1954 requires the self-employed to pay taxes on their net earnings to help fund Social Security, and later Medicare once it was started. 3 4 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Individuals' FICA contributions pay current benefits and build future ones that will be owed to them. FICA contributions are withheld from a wage earner's gross pay; the amount withheld depends on gross wages.  Employers match the FICA taxes paid by their employees. Wage earners cannot opt out of paying FICA taxes.  Since the 1930s, FICA has funded Social Security programs that provide benefits to retirees, children and surviving spouses, and the disabled. 
 
    Understanding FICA    
    History    
  In 1935, the United States Congress passed the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, known as FICA. Its purpose was to collect contributions to fund the new Social Security program established by the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the same year.
 
 
  Roosevelt believed that the money collected from all working Americans through FICA would belong directly to them. He didn't want the financial benefits for their retirement, disability, or death to depend on federal revenue. He feared that politicians would take and use the money for their own purposes. 5

  In 1965, the payroll tax to fund health care benefits was added when Medicare was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. 6 
 
 
  FICA contributions are mandatory. Although the rate can be set annually, it has remained mostly stable since 1990. The limit changes each year based on the National Average Wage Index. 7 8 
 
 
    Rates and Limits    
  According to the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) , FICA taxes are made up of old-age, survivors, and disability insurance taxes (Social Security) plus the hospital insurance tax (Medicare). Each applies different rates. 9 
 
 
  There's a maximum  wage base  for Social Security taxes on earnings, above which no tax is levied. The wage base is set at $160,200 for 2023 and $168,600 for 2024.
 
 
  There is no wage base limit for Medicare taxes. 10 
 
 
  For 2023 and 2024, the total Social Security  tax rate  of 12.4% is split between employee and employer. The employee pays 6.2% and the employer pays the other 6.2%.
 
 
  The total  Medicare tax  rate of 2.9% is also split between employee and employer. The employee pays 1.45% and the employer pays 1.45%. 9 
 
 
  Employees pay an additional 0.9% Medicare tax on wages over a threshold amount. For 2023 and 2024, that amount is $200,000 for individuals ($250,000 for  married couples filing jointly ). 11  So, depending on their wages, an employee's total Medicare tax could reach 2.35% (1.45% plus 0.9%). Employers are not required to match the additional Medicare tax. 9 
 
 
    The Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA)    
  Under SECA, the  self-employed  pay both the employee and employer portions of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. For example, as a sole proprietor, you'd be responsible for paying 12.4% of your income toward Social Security and 2.9% toward Medicare. 12 
 
 
  Moreover, you'd pay the additional Medicare tax of 0.9% on self-employment income over the threshold amount. 11 
 
 
  Though they pay more than wage earners, self-employed individuals do get a tax break. They can deduct the amount that represents the employer's share (half) as a business expense. 12 
 
 
   Important 
 FICA and SECA taxes do not fund  Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  benefits, even though that particular program is run by the  Social Security Administration (SSA) . SSI benefits come out of general tax revenues. 13 
 
 
 
    How to Calculate FICA    
    Example 1    
  An employee earning $50,000 will pay $3,825 in FICA contributions in 2024. That breaks down to $3,100 in Social Security tax and $725 in Medicare tax. The wage earner's employer would pay the same amount.

What Is a Quota?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Quota?    
  A quota is a government-imposed trade restriction that limits the number or monetary value of goods that a country can import or export during a particular period. Countries use quotas in international trade to help regulate the  volume of trade  between them and other countries. Countries sometimes impose quotas on specific products to reduce  imports  and increase domestic production. In theory, quotas boost domestic production by restricting foreign competition.
 
 
  Government programs that implement quotas are often referred to as  protectionism  policies. Additionally, governments can enact these policies if they have concerns over the quality or safety of products arriving from other countries.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Countries use quotas in international trade to help regulate the volume of trade between them and other countries. Within the United States, there are three forms of quotas: absolute, tariff-rate, and tariff-preference level. Tariffs are taxes one country imposes on the goods and services imported from another country. Because tariffs increase the cost of imported goods and services, they make them less attractive to domestic consumers. Highly restrictive quotas coupled with high tariffs can lead to trade disputes and other problems between nations.

    How a Quota Works    
  Quotas are different from  tariffs  or customs, which place taxes on imports or exports. Governments impose both quotas and tariffs as protective measures to try to control trade between countries, but there are distinct differences between them.
 
 
 
 
  Quotas focus on limiting the quantities (or, in some cases, cumulative value) of a particular good that a country imports or  exports  for a specific period, whereas tariffs impose specific fees on those goods. Governments design tariffs (also known as customs duties) to raise the overall cost to the producer or supplier seeking to sell products within a country. Tariffs provide a country with extra revenue and they offer protection to domestic producers by causing imported items to become more expensive.
 
 
  Quotas are more effective in restricting trade than tariffs, especially if domestic demand for something is not price-sensitive. Quotas may also be more disruptive to international trade than tariffs. Applied selectively to various countries, they can be utilized as a coercive economic weapon.
 
 
   Important 
 Quotas are a type of  nontariff barrier  governments enact to restrict trade. Other kinds of trade barriers include  embargoes , levies, and sanctions. 
 
 
 
    Import Quota Regulatory Agencies    
  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, a federal law-enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, oversees the regulation of international trade, collecting customs, and enforcing U.S. trade regulations. Within the United States, the three forms of quotas are absolute, tariff-rate, and tariff-preference level: 1 
 
 
 
 An absolute quota provides a definitive restriction on the quantity of a particular good that may be imported into the United States, although this level of restriction is not always in use. Under an absolute quota, once the quantity permitted by the quota is filled, merchandise subject to the quota must be held in a bonded warehouse or entered into a foreign trade zone until the opening of the next quota period. 
 Tariff-rate quotas allow a country to import a certain quantity of a particular good at a reduced  duty  rate. Once the tariff-rate quota is met, all subsequently imported goods are charged at a higher rate. 
 A separate set of negotiations create tariff-preference levels, such as those established through  Free Trade Agreements  (FTAs). 
 
 
    Goods Subject to Tariff-Rate Quotas    
  Various commodities are subject to tariff-rate quotas when entering the United States. 2  These eligible  commodities  include, but are not limited to, milk and cream, cotton fabric, blended syrups, Canadian cheese, cocoa powder, infant formula, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco.
 
 
    Other Types of Quotas    
    Business Quotas    
  In business, a quota can refer to a sales target that a company wants a salesperson or sales team to achieve for a specific period. Sales quotas are often monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Management can also set sales quotas by region or business unit. The most common type of sales quota is based on  revenue . 
 
 
    Quotas in Politics    
  To have an adequate representation of women and marginalized persons in political offices, governments may establish quotas. However, in democratic societies, quotas often draw as much criticism as it does support.
 
 
  Some argue that it promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion; whereas, others argue that it challenges the fabric of democracy, whereby voters elect their officials.

    What Is Just-in-Time (JIT)?    
  The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that aligns raw-material orders from suppliers directly with production schedules. Companies employ this inventory strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they need them for the production process, which reduces inventory costs. This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing is also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS) because the car manufacturer adopted the system in the 1970s. 1 Kanban is a scheduling system often used in conjunction with JIT to avoid overcapacity of work-in-process. The success of the JIT production process relies on steady production, high-quality workmanship, no machine breakdowns, and reliable suppliers. The terms short-cycle manufacturing, used by Motorola, and continuous-flow manufacturing, used by IBM, are synonymous with the JIT system. 2 3 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Daniel Fishel 
 
    How Does Just-in-Time Inventory (JIT) Work?    
  The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system  minimizes inventory and increases efficiency . JIT production systems cut inventory costs because manufacturers receive materials and parts as needed for production and do not have to pay storage costs. Manufacturers are also not left with unwanted inventory if an order is canceled or not fulfilled.
 
 
  One example of a JIT inventory system is a car manufacturer that operates with low inventory levels but heavily relies on its supply chain to deliver the parts it requires to build cars on an as-needed basis. Consequently, the manufacturer orders the parts required to assemble the vehicles only after an order is received.
 
 
  For JIT manufacturing to succeed, companies must have steady production, high-quality workmanship, glitch-free plant machinery, and reliable suppliers.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The just-in-time inventory system is different from the  just-in-case  system, where producers hold sufficient inventories to have enough products to absorb maximum market demand. 
 
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of JIT    
  JIT inventory systems have several advantages over traditional models. Production runs are short, which means that manufacturers can quickly move from one product to another. Also, this method reduces costs by minimizing warehouse needs. Companies also spend less money on  raw materials  because they buy just enough resources to make the ordered products and no more.

  The disadvantages of JIT inventory systems involve potential disruptions in the supply chain. If a raw-materials supplier has a breakdown and cannot deliver the goods promptly, this could conceivably stall the entire production line. A sudden unexpected order for goods may delay the delivery of finished products to end clients.
 
 
    Example of JIT    
  Famous for its JIT inventory system, Toyota Motor Corporation orders parts only when it receives new car orders. Although the company installed this method in the 1970s, it took 20 years to perfect it. 4

 Definition 
 Regulators use the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to compare large and dominant companies in an industry and determine whether that industry is close to being a monopoly. 
    What Is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)?    
  The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measures the size of companies relative to the size of the industry they're in. It calculates the amount of competitiveness by squaring the  market share  of each firm competing within a market and then summing the resulting numbers. It can range from close to zero to 10,000 with lower values indicating a less concentrated market.
 
 
  The (HHI is a common measure of market concentration. It's often used in pre- and post- merger and acquisition (M&A)  transactions.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is used to determine market competitiveness. A market with an HHI of less than 1,500 is considered a competitive marketplace. An HHI of 1,500 to 2,500 is moderately concentrated.  An HHI of 2,500 or greater is highly concentrated. The primary disadvantage of the HHI stems from the fact that it's such a simple measure and fails to take into account the complexities of various markets. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Crea Taylor 
 
    Formula and Calculation of the HHI    
  The HHI is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration. It's calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in a market and then summing the resulting numbers. It can range from close to zero to 10,000. The U.S. Department of Justice uses the HHI for evaluating potential merger antitrust issues. 1 
 H H I = s 1 2 + s 2 2 + s 3 2 + … s n 2 where: s n = the market share percentage of firm  n  expressed as a whole number, not a decimal \begin{aligned}&HHI=s^2_1+s^2_2+s^2_3+\dots s^2_n\\&\textbf{where:}\\&s_n=\text{the market share percentage of firm } n\\& \qquad\,\text{ expressed as a whole number, not a decimal}\end{aligned} ​ H H I = s 1 2 ​ + s 2 2 ​ + s 3 2 ​ + … s n 2 ​ where: s n ​ = the market share percentage of firm  n  expressed as a whole number, not a decimal ​ 
 
 
    What the HHI Can Tell You    
  The closer a market is to a  monopoly , the higher the market's concentration and the lower its competition. A firm would have 100% market share and the HHI would equal 10,000, indicating a monopoly, if it was the only one firm in an industry. Each would have roughly 0% market share if there were thousands of firms competing and the HHI would be close to zero, indicating nearly perfect competition.
 
 
 
 
  The U.S. Department of Justice considers a market with an HHI of less than 1,500 to be a competitive marketplace. An HHI of 1,500 to 2,500 would be a moderately concentrated marketplace and an HHI of 2,500 or greater would be a highly concentrated marketplace. 2

  Mergers that increase the HHI by more than 200 points in highly concentrated markets generally raise  antitrust  concerns because they're assumed to enhance market power under Section 5.3 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines jointly issued by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 2 
 
 
  The primary advantage of the HHI is the simplicity of the calculation that's necessary to determine it and the small amount of data required for its calculation. The primary disadvantage of the HHI stems from the fact that it's such a simple measure and it fails to take into account the complexities of various markets in a way that allows for a genuinely accurate assessment of competitive or monopolistic market conditions.

5/1 Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (5/1 Hybrid ARM) Examples,"What Is a 5/1 Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (5/1 ARM)?    
  A 5/1 hybrid  adjustable-rate mortgage  (5/1 ARM) begins with an initial five-year fixed interest rate period, followed by a rate that adjusts on an annual basis. The “5” in the term refers to the number of years with a fixed rate, and the “1” refers to how often the rate adjusts after that (once per year). As such, monthly payments can go up—sometimes dramatically—after five years. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 5/1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer an introductory fixed rate for five years, after which the interest rate adjusts annually. When ARMs adjust, interest rates change based on their marginal rates and the indexes to which they’re tied. Homeowners generally enjoy lower mortgage payments during the introductory period. A fixed-rate mortgage may be preferable for homeowners who prefer predictability with their mortgage payments and interest costs. 
 
    How a Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (Such as a 5/1 Hybrid ARM) Works    
  The 5/1 hybrid ARM may be the most popular type of adjustable-rate mortgage, but it’s not the only option. There are 3/1, 7/1, and 10/1 ARMs as well. These loans offer an introductory fixed rate for three, seven, or 10 years, respectively, after which they adjust annually. 2 
 
 
  Also known as a five-year fixed-period ARM or a five-year ARM, this mortgage features an interest rate that adjusts according to an index plus a margin. Hybrid ARMs are very popular with consumers, as they may feature an initial interest rate significantly lower than a traditional fixed-rate mortgage. Most lenders offer at least one version of such hybrid ARMs; of these loans, the 5/1 hybrid ARM is especially popular.
 
 
  Other ARM structures exist, such as the 5/5 and  5/6 ARMs , which also feature a five-year introductory period followed by a rate adjustment every five years or every six months, respectively. Notably, 15/15 ARMs adjust once after 15 years and then remain fixed for the remainder of the loan. Less common are  2/28  and  3/27 ARMs . With the former, the fixed interest rate applies for only the first two years, followed by 28 years of adjustable rates; with the latter, the fixed rate is for three years, with adjustments in each of the following 27 years. Some of these loans adjust every six months rather than annually.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Hybrid ARMs have a fixed interest rate for a set period of years, followed by an extended period during which rates are adjustable. 
 
 
 
    Example of a 5/1 Hybrid ARM    
  Interest rates change based on their marginal rates when ARMs adjust along with the indexes to which they’re tied. If a 5/1 hybrid ARM has a 3% margin and the index is 3%, then it adjusts to 6%.
 
 
  But the extent to which the fully indexed interest rate on a 5/1 hybrid ARM can adjust is often limited by an  interest rate cap structure . The fully indexed interest rate can be tied to several different indexes, and while this number varies, the margin is fixed for the life of the loan. 3 
 
 
  A borrower can save a significant sum on their monthly payments with a 5/1 hybrid ARM. Assuming a home purchase price of $300,000 with a 20% down payment ($60,000), a borrower with very good/excellent credit can save 50 to 150 basis points on a loan and more than $100 per month in payments on their $240,000 loan. Of course, that rate could rise, so borrowers should anticipate a rise in their monthly payment, be prepared to sell their home when their rate goes up, or be ready to  refinance .
 
 
   Note 
 When refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, it’s important to consider the new loan term carefully, as it could have a significant impact on how much you pay in total interest to own the home. 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of a 5/1 Hybrid ARM    
  In most cases, ARMs offer lower introductory rates than traditional mortgages with fixed interest rates. These loans can be ideal for buyers who plan to live in their homes for only a short period of time and sell before the end of the introductory period. The 5/1 hybrid ARM also works well for buyers who plan to refinance before the introductory rate expires. That said, hybrid ARMs like the 5/1 tend to have a higher interest rate than standard ARMs.
 
 
 
 
 
 Pros 
 
 
 Lower introductory rates than traditional fixed-interest mortgages 
 Interest rates possibly drop before the mortgage adjusts, resulting in lower payments 
 Good for buyers who will live in their homes for short periods of time 
 
 
 
 
 Cons 
 
 
 Higher interest rates than standard adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) 
 When mortgage adjusts, interest rates probably rise 
 Could be trapped in unaffordable rate hikes due to personal issues or market forces 
 
 
 
 
  There’s also a chance that the interest rate might decrease, lowering the borrower’s monthly payments when it adjusts. But in many cases, the rate will rise, increasing the borrower’s monthly payments.

    What Is the Nasdaq?    
  Nasdaq is a global electronic marketplace for buying and selling securities. Its name was originally an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. Nasdaq started as a subsidiary of the  National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) , now known as the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) .
 
 
  Nasdaq was launched after the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  urged NASD to automate the market for securities not listed on an exchange. The result was the first electronic trading system. Nasdaq opened for business in 1971. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Nasdaq is an online global marketplace for buying and trading securities—the world's first electronic exchange. It operates 29 markets, one clearinghouse, and five central securities depositories in the United States and Europe. Most of the world's technology giants are listed on the Nasdaq.

 Definition 
 The price-to-earnings ratio compares a company's share price with its earnings per share. Analysts and investors use it to determine the relative value of a company's shares in side-by-side comparisons. 
    What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio?    
  The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company's share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). Often called the price or earnings multiple, the P/E ratio helps assess the relative value of a company's stock. It's handy for comparing a company's valuation against its historical performance, against other firms within its industry, or the overall market.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the proportion of a company's share price to its earnings per share. A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates. Companies with no earnings or are losing money don't have a P/E ratio because there's nothing to put in the denominator. The two most used P/E ratios are forward and trailing P/E. P/E ratios are most valuable when comparing similar companies in the same industry or for a single company over time. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A P/E Ratio can help compare a company's valuation against historical performance, other firms within its industry, or the overall market. 
 Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu 
 
    Understanding the P/E Ratio    
  The P/E ratio is one of the most widely used by investors and analysts reviewing a stock's relative valuation. It helps to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. A company's P/E can also be benchmarked against other stocks in the same industry or against the broader market, such as the S&P 500 Index.
 
 
  Analysts interested in long-term valuation trends can look at the P/E 10 or P/E 30 measures, which average the past 10 or 30 years of earnings. These measures are often used when trying to gauge the overall value of a stock index, such as the S&P 500, because these longer-term metrics can show overall changes through several  business cycles .
 
 
  The P/E ratio of the S&P 500 going back to 1927 has had a low of roughly 6 in mid-1949 and been as high as 122 in mid-2009, right after the financial crisis. As of April 2024, the S&P 500's P/E ratio was 26.26. 1 
 
 
 
 
    P/E Ratio Formula and Calculation    
  The formula and calculation are as follows: 
 P/E Ratio = Market value per share Earnings per share \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market value per share}}{\text{Earnings per share}} P/E Ratio = Earnings per share Market value per share ​ 
 To  determine the P/E value , divide the stock price by the EPS. 
 The stock price (P) can be found simply by searching a stock’s ticker on a reputable financial website. Although this concrete value reflects what investors currently pay for the stock, the EPS is related to earnings reported at different times. 
 EPS is generally given in two ways. Trailing 12 months (TTM) represents the company's performance over the past 12 months. Another is found in earnings releases, which often provide EPS guidance. This is the company's advice on what it expects in future earnings. These different versions of EPS form the basis of trailing and forward P/E, respectively.

    What Is a Discount Rate?    
  The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges commercial banks and other financial institutions for short-term loans. The discount rate is applied at the Fed's lending facility, which is called the discount window.
 
 
  A discount rate can also refer to the interest rate used in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. In this case, investors and businesses can use the discount rate for potential investments.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 In banking, the discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges banks for short-term loans. Discount lending is a key monetary policy tool and part of the Fed's function as the lender-of-last-resort. In discounted cash flow analysis, the discount rate is the rate used to discount future cash flows. The discount rate expresses the time value of money in DCF and can make the difference between whether an investment project is financially viable or not. You can calculate the discount rate in DCF as long as you know the future and present values and the total number of years. 
 
 
 Fed's Discount Rate 
 
 
    How the Fed’s Discount Rate Works    
  Commercial banks in the U.S. have two primary ways to borrow money for their short-term operating needs. They can borrow and loan money to other banks without the need for any collateral using the market-driven  interbank rate , or they can borrow money for their short-term operating requirements from the  Federal Reserve Bank .
 
 
 
 
  Federal Reserve loans are processed through the  12 regional branches of the Fed . The loans are used by financial institutes to cover any cash shortfalls, head off any liquidity problems, or in the worst-case scenario, prevent the bank’s failure. This Fed-offered lending facility is known as the discount window.

  The loans are incredibly short-term: 24 hours or less. The rate of interest charged is the standard  discount rate . The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve set this discount rate. 1 
 
 
    The 3 Tiers of the Fed’s Discount Window Loans    
  The Fed's discount window program runs three tiers of loans, each using a separate but related rate. It also allows for emergency credit approvals for banks in distress.
 
 
  The Fed determines the discount rates for the first two tiers independently. The rate for the third tier is based on the prevailing rates in the market.
 
 
 
 First Tier : Called the primary credit program, this tier provides capital to financially sound banks with good credit records. This primary credit discount rate is usually set above existing market  interest rates  which may be available from other banks or other sources of similar short-term debt. 
 Second Tier :   Called the secondary  credit  program, it offers similar loans to institutions that do not qualify for the primary rate. It is usually set 50 basis points higher than the primary rate (one percentage point = 100 basis points). Institutions in this tier are smaller and may not be as financially healthy as the ones that use the primary tier.

"Goods and Services Tax (GST): Definition, Types, and How It's Calculated","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a value-added tax levied on goods and services and included in the price of a product. 
    What Is the Goods and Services Tax (GST)?    
  The goods and services tax (GST) is a value-added tax (VAT) levied on most goods and services sold for  domestic consumption . The GST is paid by consumers, but it is remitted to the government by the businesses selling the goods and services.
 
 
  Critics point out, however, that the GST may disproportionately burden people whose self-reported income are in the lowest and middle income brackets, making it a regressive tax. These critics argue that GST can therefore exacerbate income inequality and contribute to social and economic disparities. In order to address these concerns, some countries have introduced GST exemptions or reduced GST rates on essential goods and services, such as food and healthcare. Others have implemented GST credits or rebates to help offset the impact of GST on lower income households.
 
 
  Goods and services tax should not be confused with the  generation-skipping trust , also abbreviated GST (and its related taxation,  GSTT ).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The goods and services tax (GST) is a tax on goods and services sold domestically for consumption. The tax is included in the final price and paid by consumers at point of sale and passed to the government by the seller. The GST is usually taxed as a single rate across a nation. Governments prefer GST as it simplifies the taxation system and reduces tax avoidance. Critics of GST say it burdens lower income earners more than higher income earners. 
 
    Understanding the Goods and Services Tax (GST)    
  The goods and services tax (GST) is an  indirect federal sales tax  that is applied to the cost of certain goods and services. The business adds the GST to the price of the product, and a customer who buys the product pays the sales price inclusive of the GST. The GST portion is collected by the business or seller and forwarded to the government. It is also referred to as  Value-Added Tax  (VAT) in some countries.
 
 
 
 
  Most countries with a GST have a single unified GST system, which means that a single tax rate is applied throughout the country. A country with a unified GST platform merges central taxes (e.g., sales tax, excise duty tax, and service tax) with state-level taxes (e.g., entertainment tax, entry tax,  transfer tax ,  sin tax , and luxury tax) and collects them as one single tax. These countries tax virtually everything at a single rate.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 France was the first country to implement the GST in 1954; since then, an estimated 140 countries have adopted this tax system in some form or another. 1  Some of the countries with a GST include Canada, Vietnam, Australia, Singapore, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Nigeria, Brazil, and India. 2 
 
 
 
    Dual Goods and Services Tax Structures    
  Only a handful of countries, such as Canada and Brazil, have a dual GST structure. 3  Compared to a unified GST economy where tax is collected by the federal government and then distributed to the states, in a dual system, the federal GST is applied in addition to a local sales tax. In Canada, for example, the federal government levies a 5% tax and some provinces also  levy  a provincial sales tax (PST), which varies from 8% to 10%. 4 5  In this case, a consumer's receipt will clearly have the GST and PST rate that was applied to their purchase value.
 
 
  More recently, the GST and PST have been combined in some provinces into a single tax known as the  Harmonized Sales Tax  (HST). Prince Edward Island was the first to adopt the HST in 2013, combining its federal and provincial sales taxes into a single tax. 6  Since then, several other provinces have followed suit, including New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. 4  
 
 
    Critiques of the GST    
  GST is generally considered to be a  regressive tax , meaning that it takes a relatively larger percentage of income from lower-income households compared to higher-income households. 7  This is because GST is levied uniformly on the consumption of goods and services, rather than on income or wealth.
 
 
  Lower income households tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on consumables, such as food and household goods, which are subject to GST. As a result, GST can disproportionately burden lower income households.
 
 
  Because of this. some countries with GST have considered possible adjustments that could make the tax more progressive by taking a larger percentage from higher-income earners. 8     
 
 
    Example: India's Adoption of the GST    
  India established a dual GST structure in 2017, which was the biggest reform in the country's tax structure in decades. 9  The main objective of incorporating the GST was to eliminate tax on tax, or  double taxation , which cascades from the manufacturing level to the consumption level","By

 Definition 
 An exchange-traded fund pools a group of securities into a fund and can be traded like an individual stock on an exchange. 
    What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)?    
  An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds multiple underlying assets and can be bought and sold on an exchange, much like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of stocks—even specific investment strategies. Various ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, or hedging risk in an investor’s  portfolio . The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ), which tracks the  S&P 500 Index . 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An exchange-traded fund is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate throughout the trading day unlike mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes. ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer brokerage commissions than buying stocks individually.

    How ETFs Work    
  An ETF must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the United States, most ETFs are set up as  open-ended funds  and are subject to the  Investment Company Act  of 1940, except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. 2  Open-ended funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product.
 
 
  Vanguard's Consumer Staples ETF ( VDC ) tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index and has a minimum investment of $1.00. The fund holds shares of all 104 companies on the index, some familiar to most because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Proctor & Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo. 3 4 
 
 
  There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after the markets close. 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Volatility is limited with an ETF because its holdings are diversified. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors during  economic cycles .

    Types of ETFs    
 
 Passive ETFs:   Passive  ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a broader index—either a diversified index such as the S&P 500 or a more targeted sector or trend. 
 Actively managed ETFs:  These ETFs don't target an index. Instead, portfolio managers make decisions about which securities to buy and sell.  Actively managed  ETFs have benefits over passive ETFs but charge higher fees. 
 Bond ETFs:  Used to provide regular income to investors. Distribution depends on the performance of underlying bonds which may include government, corporate, and state and local bonds, usually called  municipal bonds . Unlike their underlying instruments,  bond   ETFs  do not have a maturity date.

"Joint Probability: Definition, Formula, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The term joint probability is often used to describe the likelihood that two or more events will occur at the same time. 
    What Is Joint Probability?    
  A joint probability is the chance that two or more events will happen at the same time. For a joint probability to work, both events must be independent of one another. For instance, it's the likelihood of flipping a coin and getting heads and rolling a die and getting a six. Another example is rolling two dice and both landing on a three. You can visualize joint probabilities using Venn diagrams. Joint probabilities help statisticians, data analysts, and financial professionals draft models, assess risk, and make investment decisions.

 A joint probability determines the likelihood that two events will take place at the same time. Joint probability is also called the intersection of two or more events. You can visualize joint probabilities using Venn diagrams. It's commonly used to make statistical models and risk management decisions. 
 
    Formula and Calculation of Joint Probability    
  Notation for joint probability can take a few different forms. The following formula represents the probability of events intersection:
 
 
   P   ( X ⋂ Y ) where: X , Y = Two different events that intersect P ( X  and  Y ) , P ( X Y ) = The joint probability of X and Y \begin{aligned} & P\ \left ( X\bigcap Y \right ) \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &X, Y = \text{Two different events that intersect}\\ &P(X \text{ and } Y), P(XY) = \text{The joint probability of X and Y}\\ \end{aligned} ​ P   ( X ⋂ Y ) where: X , Y = Two different events that intersect P ( X  and  Y ) , P ( X Y ) = The joint probability of X and Y ​ ﻿
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Although joint probability can help you determine the likelihood of two different events happening at the same time, it does not indicate how the two events may influence each other. 
 
 
 
    What Does Joint Probability Tell You?    
  Probability is a field closely related to  statistics  that deals with the likelihood of an event or phenomenon occurring. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an impossible chance of occurrence and 1 denotes the certain outcome of an event. 
 For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is 1/2 = 0.5. This means there is an equal chance of drawing a red and black card since there are 26 of each in a deck. As such, there is a 50-50 probability of drawing a red card versus a black card. 
 Joint probability measures two events that happen at the same time. It can only be applied to situations where more than one observation can occur at the same time. So the joint probability of picking a card that is both red and 6 from a deck is P(6 ∩ red) = 2/52 = 1/26 since a deck of cards has two red sixes—the six of hearts and the six of diamonds. Because the events red and 6 are independent, you can also use the following formula to calculate the joint probability: 
 
 
 P ( 6 ∩ r e d ) = P ( 6 ) × P ( r e d ) = 4 / 5 2 × 2 6 / 5 2 = 1 / 2 6 P(6 \cap red) = P(6) \times P(red) = 4/52 \times 26/52 = 1/26 P ( 6 ∩ r e d ) = P ( 6 ) × P ( r e d ) = 4 / 5 2 × 2 6 / 5 2 = 1 / 2 6 
 The symbol “∩” in a joint probability is referred to as an intersection. The probability of event X and event Y happening is the same thing as the point where X and Y intersect. Therefore, the joint probability is also called the intersection of two or more events. A  Venn diagram  is perhaps the best visual tool to explain an intersection:

  From the Venn above, the point where both circles overlap is the intersection, which has two observations: the six of hearts and the six of diamonds.
 
 
    Joint Probability vs. Conditional Probability    
  Joint probability should not be confused with  conditional probability , which is the probability that one event will happen given that another action or event happens. The conditional probability formula is as follows: 
 P ( X , g i v e n   Y )  or  P ( X ∣ Y ) P(X, given~Y) \text{ or } P(X | Y) P ( X , g i v e n   Y )  or  P ( X ∣ Y ) 
 This is to say that the chance of one event happening is conditional on another event happening. For example, from a deck of cards, the probability that you get a six, given that you drew a red card is P(6│red) = 2/26 = 1/13, since there are two sixes out of 26 red cards. 
 Joint probability only factors in the likelihood of both events occurring. Conditional probability can be used to calculate joint probability, as seen in this formula: 
 P ( X ∩ Y ) = P ( X ∣ Y ) × P ( Y ) P(X \cap Y) = P(X|Y) \times P(Y) P ( X ∩ Y ) = P ( X ∣ Y ) × P ( Y ) 
 The probability that A and B occurs is the probability of X occurring, given that Y occurs multiplied by the probability that Y occurs. Given this formula, the probability of drawing a 6 and a red at the same time will be as follows: 
 P ( 6 ∩ r e d ) = P ( 6 ∣ r","By

Applicable Federal Rate (AFR): What It Is and How To Use It,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR)?    
  According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), private loans must charge a minimum interest rate known as the applicable federal rate (AFR), published monthly by the IRS. Since private  loans  can vary by term length, the IRA publishes several AFRs by loan type. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Applicable federal rates (AFR) are an interest rate index published monthly by the IRS. Lenders use AFRs to determine how much interest to charge on below-market loans. Personal loans must have an interest rate at least the same as the applicable AFR, or the borrower will be charged additional taxes. 
 
    How the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) Is Determined by the IRS    
  The  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  uses the applicable federal rate (AFR) to help people initiating personal loans determine whether they're charging enough interest. If not, both the  lender  and borrower could be liable for additional  taxes  and penalties.
 
 
  Typically, a lender, such as a  bank  or  credit union , would issue a loan at an  interest rate  high enough to cover the cost of processing the loan and earn a profit. The loan rate also includes the embedded risk of lending to the borrower.
 
 
  However, when family members lend to one another, they might issue a loan at a below-market rate in an effort to help their family members. However, the IRS mandates a minimum interest rate that must be applied to a private  loan —the applicable federal rate (AFR).
 
 
  People interested in taking out a  personal loan  should review the AFR to see if they're charging or paying enough interest. For example, if you're making a  personal loan  to a family member, check that you're charging at least the AFR, or you'll get hit with a tax bill for the interest the IRS believes you should have received for the loan.
 
 
  To determine the monthly AFR, the IRS considers a number of economic factors, like U.S. Treasury obligations from the previous month. It publishes these rates under Section 1274(d) of the  Internal Revenue Code . 2 
 
 
 
 
    Types of Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs)    
  When you pull up the monthly applicable federal rate (AFR), you'll see several rates listed based on  loan type . In other words, you apply a different rate depending on the length of the loan.
 
 
   Short-term AFR: Loans with a term of three years or less Mid-term AFR: Loans with a term of four to nine years Long-term AFR: Loans with a term of over nine years 
 
 
  The U.S. Treasury Department determines the AFRs for each term based on the average yields for marketable debt securities with similar maturities. 3 
 
 
   Important 
 When you pull up the AFR rates, you'll also see various compounding interest periods (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly). 
 
 
 
    How to Use the AFR When Loaning Money    
  The easiest way to understand AFR is by providing an example of when most people will encounter the term.
 
 
    Below Market Rate    
  Imagine you loaned money to a family member but didn't charge them interest. If the IRS learns you didn't charge interest, the IRS would tax the interest you earned, but the amount of interest would count toward your  tax-free gift  limit for the year. 4 
 
 
  To avoid surprises when you file your taxes, use the AFR index published the month you provided your family member the loan. To find which rate to use, you'd consider the length of the loan: short-term (three years or less), mid-term (four to nine years), and long-term (more than nine years). 3 
 
 
    Loan at the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR)    
  Let's say that you're loaning your sister $10,000 to be repaid within one year. Since the  loan  term is three years or less, you would use the annual short-term AFR. As a result, your sister would pay you 4.16% based on the AFR as of April 2025. In other words, your sister would pay you $416 in interest by the end of the year. 1 
 
 
  If you charge your sister a rate less than 4.16% (the published AFR for your loan terms), you trigger a taxable event, meaning the $416 you earned would be considered  taxable income . The IRS might also impose penalties.
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  Paying attention to and charging the applicable federal rate might seem like just one extra step to complicate what should be a simple loan between a few people. However, the IRS uses the AFR to determine whether the interest charged is a  gift  or part of a loan. As a result, it's important to reference the AFR so you know how much interest to charge for a personal loan, or you'll be on the hook for additional taxes and penalties.

"Q Ratio or Tobin's Q: Definition, Formula, Uses, and Examples","What Is the Q Ratio or Tobin's Q?    
  The Q ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, measures the relationship between  market valuation  and  intrinsic value . In other words, it estimates whether a business or market is overvalued or  undervalued .
 
 
  The Q ratio is calculated by dividing the market value of a company by its assets' replacement cost. Thus, equilibrium is when market value equals replacement cost.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Q ratio was popularized by Nobel Laureate James Tobin and invented in 1966 by Nicholas Kaldor. The Q ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, measures whether a firm or an aggregate market is relatively over- or undervalued. It relies on the concepts of market value and replacement value. The simplified Q ratio is the equity market value divided by equity book value. 
 
    Formula and Calculation of the Q Ratio    
 
 Tobin’s Q = Total Market Value of Firm Total Asset Value of Firm \text{Tobin's Q}=\frac{\text{Total Market Value of Firm}}{\text{Total Asset Value of Firm}} Tobin’s Q = Total Asset Value of Firm Total Market Value of Firm ​ 
 
 
  The Q ratio is calculated as the market value of a company divided by the replacement value of the firm's assets. Since the replacement cost of total assets is difficult to estimate, another version of the formula is often used by analysts to estimate Tobin's Q ratio. It is as follows:
 
 
 
 Tobin’s Q = Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value \text{Tobin's Q} = \frac{\text{Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value}}{\text{Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value}} Tobin’s Q = Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value ​ 
 
 
  Often, the assumption is made the market value of liabilities and the book value of a company's liabilities are equivalent, since market value typically does not account for a firm's liabilities. This provides a simplified version of the Tobin's Q ratio as the following:
 
 
 
 Tobin’s Q = Equity Market Value Equity Book Value \text{Tobin's Q} = \frac{\text{Equity Market Value}}{\text{Equity Book Value}} Tobin’s Q = Equity Book Value Equity Market Value ​ 
 
 
    What the Q Ratio Can Tell You    
  The Tobin's Q ratio is a quotient popularized by  James Tobin  of Yale University, Nobel laureate in economics, who hypothesized that the combined  market value  of all the companies on the stock market should be about equal to their replacement costs. 
 While Tobin is often attributed as its creator, this ratio was first proposed in an academic publication by economist Nicholas Kaldor in 1966. In earlier texts, the ratio is sometimes referred to as ""Kaldor's v."" 1 
 A low Q ratio—between 0 and 1—means that the cost to replace a firm's assets is greater than the value of its stock. This implies that the stock is undervalued. Conversely, a high Q (greater than 1) implies that a firm's stock is more expensive than the  replacement cost  of its assets, which implies that the stock is  overvalued . 
 This measure of stock valuation is the driving factor behind investment decisions in Tobin's Q ratio. When applied to the market as a whole, we can gauge whether an entire market is relatively overbought or undervalued; we can represent this relationship as follows: 
 
 
 
 Q Ratio (Market) = Market Capitalization of all Companies Replacement Value of all Companies \text{Q Ratio (Market)} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization of all Companies}}{\text{Replacement Value of all Companies}} Q Ratio (Market) = Replacement Value of all Companies Market Capitalization of all Companies ​ 
 
 For either a firm or a market, a ratio greater than one would theoretically indicate that the market or company is overvalued. A ratio that is less than one would imply that it is undervalued. 
 Underlying these simple equations is an equally simple intuition regarding the relationship between price and value. In essence, Tobin’s Q Ratio asserts that a business (or a market) is worth what it costs to replace. The cost necessary to replace the business (or market) is its  replacement value . 
 It might seem logical that fair market value would be a Q ratio of 1.0. But, that has not historically been the case.  Prior to 1995 (for data as far back as 1945), the U.S. Q ratio never reached 1.0. During the first quarter of 2000, the Q ratio hit 2.15, while in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.66. As of the second quarter of 2020, the Q ratio was 2.12. 2 
 
 
   1.730 
 The Q ratio for the entire U.S. stock market, as of March 31, 2024. In other words, the market value of all public companies is 73% greater than the replacement cost of all their assets. 3 
 
    Replacement Value and the Q Ratio    
  Replacement value (or replacement cost) refers to the cost of replacing an existing asset based on its current market price. For example, the replacement value of a one-terabyte hard drive might be just $50 today, even if we paid $500 for the same storage spac","By

"Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), What It Was, How It Worked","Close 
 
 
 
    What Was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)?    
  The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was an initiative created and  run  by the U.S. Treasury to stabilize the country’s financial system, restore economic growth, and mitigate  foreclosures  in the wake of the  2008 financial crisis . TARP sought to achieve these targets by purchasing troubled companies’ assets and stock.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was instituted by the U.S. Treasury following the 2008 financial crisis. TARP stabilized the financial system by having the government buy mortgage-backed securities and bank stocks. From 2008 to 2010, TARP invested $426.4 billion in firms and recouped $441.7 billion in return. TARP was controversial at the time, and its effectiveness continues to be debated. 
 
    How the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Worked    
  Global credit markets came to a near standstill in September 2008 as several major financial institutions, such as  Fannie Mae ,  Freddie Mac , and American International Group (AIG), experienced severe financial problems.  Lehman Brothers  went bankrupt, and investment companies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley changed their  charters  to become commercial banks in an attempt to stabilize their capital situations. 1 2 
 
 
  To prevent the situation from completely spiraling out of control, Treasury Secretary  Henry Paulson  pioneered the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008, with the passage of the  Emergency Economic Stabilization Act . 3 4 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Alison Czinkota / Investopedia 
 
  TARP's original purpose was to increase the liquidity of the money markets and  secondary mortgage markets  by purchasing the  mortgage-backed securities (MBS) , and through that, reduce the potential losses of the institutions that owned them.
 
 
  Later, TARP's aim was modified slightly to allow the government to buy equity in banks and other financial institutions. TARP initially gave the Treasury purchasing power of $700 billion; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (simply referred to as  Dodd-Frank ) later reduced the $700 billion authorization to $475 billion. 5 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 TARP funds were used to purchase stock in banks, insurance companies, and auto-makers, and to loan funds to financial institutions and homeowners. 6 
 
 
 
  The U.S. government bought  preferred stock  in eight banks: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo. The banks were required to give the government a 5% dividend that would increase to 9% in 2013, encouraging banks to buy back the stock within five years. 7 
 
 
  From the program’s inception until October 3, 2010 (the deadline for extending funds), $245 billion was used to stabilize banks, $27 billion went to programs to increase credit availability, $80 billion went to the U.S. auto industry (specifically, GM and Chrysler), $68 billion was used to stabilize AIG, and $46 billion went to foreclosure-prevention programs, such as Making Home Affordable. 5 8 
 
 
  The provisions of TARP demanded that companies involved lose certain tax benefits and, in many cases, placed limits on executive compensation and forbade fund recipients from awarding bonuses to their top 25 highest-paid executives. 9  Even so, by 2009, bailed-out firms paid some $20 billion to key personnel—sardonically referred to as  TARP bonuses . 10 
 
 
    The Legacy of TARP    
  When the Treasury wrapped up TARP, the government concluded that its investments had earned more than $11 billion for taxpayers by 2010. 11  To be more specific, TARP recovered funds totaling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested. The government also claimed that TARP prevented the American auto industry from failing and saved more than one million jobs, helped stabilize banks, and restored credit availability for individuals and businesses. 12 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 TARP is still controversial. Advocates say it saved the U.S. financial system and shortened the financial crisis while critics charge the initiative just gave Wall Street an unnecessary boost. 
 
 
 
  Even so, economists, politicians, and financial professionals still debate TARP's merits and wonder if it had been necessary. Critics charge the program did little to help the housing markets, which remained depressed for years. Some say it did not go far enough—that the government should have insisted on an equity stake in the financial firms it was bailing out to control their future practices.
 
 
  Instead, critics opine that TARP's no-strings loans essentially acted as a reward for bad behavior, sending a message of ""act irresponsibly and we'll help you out""—and establishing a dangerous precedent of dependency.
 
 
  TARP also did not endear the government to the American public, wh","By

 Definition 
 The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes an investment's net present value (NPV) of cash flows equal to zero, estimating its annual growth rate. 
    What Is IRR?    
  IRR, or internal rate of return, is a metric used in financial analysis to estimate the profitability of potential investments. IRR is a  discount rate  that makes the  net present value (NPV)  of all cash flows equal to zero in a  discounted cash flow analysis .
 
 
  IRR calculations rely on the same formula as NPV does. Keep in mind that IRR is not the actual dollar value of the project. It is the annual return that makes the NPV equal to zero.
 
 
  Generally speaking, the higher an internal rate of return, the  more desirable an investment is  to undertake. IRR is uniform for investments of varying types and, as such, can be used to rank multiple prospective investments or projects on a relatively even basis. In general, when comparing investment options with other similar characteristics, the investment with the highest IRR probably would be considered the best.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 IRR is calculated using the same concept as net present value (NPV), except it sets the NPV equal to zero. The ultimate goal of IRR is to identify the rate of discount, which makes the present value of the sum of annual nominal cash inflows equal to the initial net cash outlay for the investment. IRR is ideal for analyzing capital budgeting projects to understand and compare potential rates of annual return over time. In addition to being used by companies to determine which capital projects to use, IRR can help investors determine the investment return of various assets.

    The Formula for IRR    
  The formula used to determine IRR is as follows: 
 0 = NPV = ∑ t = 1 T C t ( 1 + I R R ) t − C 0 where: C t = Net cash inflow during the period t C 0 = Total initial investment costs I R R = The internal rate of return t = The number of time periods \begin{aligned} &\text{0}=\text{NPV}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{C_t}{\left(1+IRR\right)^t}-C_0\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &C_t=\text{Net cash inflow during the period t}\\ &C_0=\text{Total initial investment costs}\\ &IRR=\text{The internal rate of return}\\ &t=\text{The number of time periods}\\ \end{aligned} ​ 0 = NPV = t = 1 ∑ T ​ ( 1 + I R R ) t C t ​ ​ − C 0 ​ where: C t ​ = Net cash inflow during the period t C 0 ​ = Total initial investment costs I R R = The internal rate of return t = The number of time periods ​

 Using the formula, one would set  NPV  equal to zero and solve for the discount rate, which is the IRR. 
 Note that the initial investment is always negative because it represents an outflow. 
 Each subsequent cash flow could be positive or negative, depending on the estimates of what the project delivers or requires as a capital injection in the future.

 Definition 
 Fiduciaries are persons or organizations who act on behalf of others and are required to put clients’ interests ahead of their own. 
  Fiduciaries are persons or organizations that act on behalf of others and are required to put the clients’ interests ahead of their own, with a duty to preserve good faith and trust. Fiduciaries are thus legally and ethically bound to act in the other’s best interests.
 
 
  A fiduciary may be responsible for the general well-being of another (e.g., a child’s legal guardian), but the task usually involves finances—for example, managing the assets of another person or a group of people. Money managers, financial advisors, bankers, insurance agents, accountants, executors, board members, and corporate officers all have fiduciary responsibilities.

Fiduciary duties appear in various business relationships, including between a trustee and a beneficiary, corporate board members and shareholders, and executors and legatees. An investment fiduciary is anyone with legal responsibility for managing somebody else’s money, such as a member of the investment committee of a charity. Registered investment advisors and insurance agents have a fiduciary duty to their clients. Broker-dealers may be subject to the less stringent standard set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation Best Interest, implemented in 2019.

    Understanding Fiduciaries    
  A fiduciary’s responsibilities and duties are ethical and legal. When a party knowingly accepts a fiduciary duty on behalf of another, they are required to act in the best interest of the principal (i.e., the client or party whose assets they are managing). This is what is known as a “prudent person standard of care,” which stems from an 1830 court ruling,  Harvard College vs. Armory , and is found in many state laws via the American Law Institute's Uniform Prudent Investor Act from 1994. 1 2  
 
 
  The  prudent-person rule  requires a fiduciary to act first and foremost with the needs of beneficiaries in mind. Strict care must be taken to ensure that no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and the principal.
 
 
 
 
  In many cases, no profit is to be made from the relationship unless explicit consent is granted when the relationship begins. For example, in the United Kingdom, fiduciaries cannot profit from their position, according to an English High Court ruling,  Keech vs. Sandford  (1726). 3  If the principal provides consent, then the fiduciary can keep whatever benefit they have received; these benefits can be either monetary or defined more broadly as an “opportunity.”

How Equity Portfolio Management Works,"Close 
 
 
 
  Many investment research analysts frequently turn into  portfolio managers  over time. After all, the goal of virtually all  investment analysis  is to make an investment decision or advise someone to make one.  Analyzing equities  and managing equity  portfolios  are closely linked: That's why most analysts have a good educational background in both equity analysis and subjects like  modern portfolio theory  (MPT).
 
 
  However, in finance—as in many professions—the real-world application of theoretical or academic concepts can involve thinking beyond one's specialty and training. Running a group of stock portfolios involves attention to detail, software skills, and administrative efficiency.
 
 
  In short, you need to know the mechanics of equity portfolio management to create and handle a group of distinct portfolios, ensuring they not only perform well but that they perform as a homogeneous element.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Certain mechanical elements to portfolio management must be learned before actually constructing and running equity portfolios.  Portfolio managers may be constrained by the style, values, and approach of the investment firm they work for. Understanding the tax consequences of portfolio management activity is of primary importance in building and managing portfolios over time. Portfolio modeling is a good way to apply the analysis and evaluation of a key set of stocks to a set of portfolios in one group or style.  Portfolio modeling can be an efficient link between equity analysis and portfolio management. 
 
    Limits on Portfolio Managers    
  Professional portfolio managers who work for an  investment management  company do not usually have a choice about the general investment philosophy that governs the portfolios they manage. An investment firm may have strictly defined parameters for stock selection and asset management. For example, a company may define itself as having a value investment selection style, and it uses certain trading guidelines to follow that style.
 
 
  Moreover, portfolio managers are usually constrained by  market capitalization  guidelines.  Small-cap  managers may be limited to selecting stocks in the $250 million to $1 billion market cap range.
 
 
 
 
  There may also be a ""house style"" in selection vis-a-vis economic trends. Some portfolio managers use a  bottom-up  approach in which investment decisions are made by selecting stocks without consideration to sectors or  economic forecasts . Others are  top-down  oriented, using entire sectors or macroeconomic trends as a starting point for analysis and stock selection. Many styles use a combination of these approaches.
 
 
  Of course, the individual manager's own perspectives, input, opinions, philosophies, techniques, and convictions have a role, too. That is why they are one of the highest-paid jobs in the investment industry. Yet, the first step in portfolio management is to understand their particular organization's investment universe and mantra and comply with it.
 
 
    Portfolio Managers and Tax Considerations    
  Understanding the tax consequences of portfolio management activity is of primary importance in building and running portfolios over time.
 
 
  Many institutional portfolios, such as those for retirement or pension funds, do not incur taxes every year. Their tax-sheltered status gives their portfolio managers more flexibility than they'd have with taxable portfolios.
 
 
  Non-taxable portfolios can allow themselves greater exposure to  dividend  income and short-term  capital gains  than their taxable counterparts. Managers of taxable portfolios may need to pay special attention to stock  holding periods ,  tax lots , short-term capital gains,  capital losses ,  tax selling , and dividend income generated by their holdings. They may hold themselves to a lower portfolio turnover rate (compared to non-taxable portfolios) to avoid taxable events.
 
 
    Building a Portfolio Model    
  Whether a manager is running one portfolio or 1,000 of them in a single equity  investment product  or style, building and maintaining a portfolio model is a common aspect of equity portfolio management.
 
 
  A portfolio model is a standard against which individual portfolios are matched. Generally, portfolio managers will assign a percentage weighting to every stock in the portfolio model. Then, individual portfolios are modified to match up against this weighting mix.
 
 
   Important 
 Portfolio models are often created using specialized investment management software, though general programs such as Microsoft Excel can work as well. 
 
 
 
  For example, after doing some mix of company analyses,  sector analyses , and  macroeconomic analyses , the portfolio manager may decide that it needs a relatively large weight of a particular stock. In this portfolio manager's style, a relatively large weighting is 4% of the total portfolio value. By reducing the weighting of other stocks","By

Net Worth: What It Is and How to Calculate It,"Definition 
 Net worth is the monetary value of the assets owned by an individual or business entity after subtracting the total value of their liabilities. 
    What Is Net Worth?    
  Net worth is the value of an individual's or company's  assets  minus their  liabilities . The figure for net worth provides a snapshot of a person's or company's financial position and well-being.
 
 
  Net worth is used to qualify certain people or entities for particular investment strategies or financial products such as hedge funds, structured products, other complex or alternative investments, or loans.
 
 
  Net worth has also become a fixation of popular culture with lists ranking the people with the  highest net worth  as well as the net worth of various celebrities.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Net worth compares assets to liabilities. A positive net worth is healthy, a negative net worth is not (although it may be temporary). Individuals, corporations, sectors, and even countries can have a net worth. Net worth is commonly referred to in business as book value or shareholders’ equity. People with substantial net worth are called high-net-worth individuals. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Knowing your net worth helps you understand your current financial situation and plan accordingly for the future. 
 Joules Garcia / Investopedia 
 
    How to Calculate Net Worth    
  Net worth is calculated by subtracting all liabilities from all assets.
 
 
   Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth

  An asset is anything owned that has monetary value. Liabilities are obligations that deplete financial resources. They include loans,  accounts payable (AP) , and mortgages.
 
 
 
 
  Net worth can be described as either positive or negative. Positive net worth means that assets exceed liabilities. Negative net worth indicates that liabilities exceed assets.
 
 
  Positive and increasing net worth indicates good  financial health . Decreasing net worth is cause for concern because it might signal a decrease in assets relative to liabilities.
 
 
  The best ways to improve net worth are to reduce liabilities while assets stay constant or rise in value, or increase assets while liabilities remain constant or decrease.
 
 
   Tip 
 Keeping track of your net worth over time is a good way to keep the focus on your efforts to save and to control your spending. Knowing your net worth and which way it's moving gives you a perspective on changes you may need to make for your financial goals and security. 
 
 
 
    Negative Net Worth    
  A  negative net worth  results when the value of your debts exceeds the value of your assets.
 
 
  So, for example, your net worth will be negative if the sum of your credit card bills, utility bills, outstanding mortgage payments, auto loan bills, and student loans is greater than the sum of your cash, savings, investments, and other property.
 
 
  Negative net worth is a sign that an individual or family needs to focus its energy on debt reduction. A tough budget, the use of debt reduction strategies (like the  debt snowball or debt avalanche ), and perhaps debt negotiation can sometimes help people climb out of a negative net worth hole and start building up their financial resources.
 
 
    It's Not Uncommon    
  A negative net worth isn’t uncommon early in life. Student loans mean that even those young people who are careful with their money can start out owing more than they own.
 
 
  Family responsibilities or an unexpected illness can also push people into the red.
 
 
   Filing for bankruptcy protection  to eliminate some of the debt and prevent creditors from trying to collect on it might be the most appropriate solution when nothing else has worked.
 
 
  Some liabilities  can’t be discharged , however. They include child support, alimony, taxes, and often  student loans . And many types of bankruptcy will stay on an individual’s  credit report  for 10 years. 1 
 
 
    Net Worth in Business    
  Net worth is known as book value or  shareholders’ equity  in business. The  balance sheet  is also known as a net worth statement.
 
 
  The value of a company’s equity equals the difference between the value of total assets and total liabilities. The values on a company’s balance sheet highlight historical costs or book values rather than current market values.
 
 
  Lenders scrutinize a business’s net worth to determine whether it’s financially healthy. A  creditor  might not be too confident in a company’s ability to repay its loans if total liabilities exceed total assets.

The Supply Chain: From Raw Materials to Order Fulfillment,"What Is a Supply Chain?    
  A supply chain is a network of individuals and companies that are involved in creating a product and delivering it to the consumer. Links on the chain begin with the producers of the raw materials and they end when the van delivers the finished product to the user.
 
 
   Supply chain management  is a crucial process because an optimized supply chain results in lower costs and a more efficient production cycle. Companies seek to improve their supply chains so they can reduce their costs and remain competitive.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A supply chain is a network of companies and people that are involved in the production and delivery of a product or service. The components of a supply chain include producers, vendors, warehouses, transportation companies, distribution centers, and retailers. The functions of a supply chain include product development, marketing, operations, distribution, finance, and customer service. Many supply chains are global in scale. Effective supply chain management results in lower costs and faster production cycles. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Michela Buttignol 
 
    Understanding a Supply Chain    
  A supply chain includes every step that's involved in getting a finished product or service to the customer. The steps may include sourcing raw materials, moving them to production, then transporting the finished products to a distribution center or retail store where they can be delivered to consumers.
 
 
  The entities involved in the supply chain include producers, vendors, warehouses, transportation companies, distribution centers, and retailers.
 
 
  The supply chain begins operating when a business receives an order from a customer. Its essential functions include product development, marketing, operations, distribution networks, finance, and customer service.
 
 
  It can lower a company's overall costs and boost its profitability when supply chain management is effective. It can affect the rest of the chain and can be costly if one link breaks.
 
 
 
 
    What Are the Main Supply Chain Models?    
  The supply chain model that a company selects will depend on how the company is structured and its specific needs.
 
 
 
 Continuous Flow Model:  This traditional supply chain model works well for companies that produce the same products with little variation. The products should be in high demand and require little to no redesign. This lack of fluctuation means managers can streamline production times and keep tight control over inventory. Managers must regularly replenish raw materials to prevent production  bottlenecks  in a continuous flow model. 
 Fast Chain Model:  This model works best for companies that sell products based on the latest trends. Businesses that use this model must get their products to market quickly to take advantage of the prevailing trend. They must rapidly move from idea to prototype to production to consumer.  Fast fashion  is an example of an industry that uses this supply chain model. 
 Flexible Model:  Companies that manufacture seasonal or holiday merchandise often use the flexible model. They experience surges in demand for their products followed by long periods of little to no demand. Using the flexible model ensures that they're able to gear up quickly to begin production and shut down efficiently as soon as demand tapers off. Profit depends on being accurate in forecasting their need for raw materials, inventory, and labor. 
 
 
    What Are Supply Chain Management Best Practices?    
  Successful supply chain management systems benefit from several practices:
 
 
   They support continuous improvement. They aim for increased velocity. They encourage collaboration among the individual businesses in the supply chain. They seek new technologies that improve their processes. They have metrics in place that allow employees to measure the success or failure of each step in the supply chain. 
 
 
    Supply Chain Management vs. Business Logistics Management?    
  The terms  supply chain management  (SCM) and business logistics management or simply  logistics  are often used interchangeably but logistics is one link in the supply chain.
 
 
  Logistics deals with the planning and control of the movement and storage of goods and services from their point of origin to their final destination.
 
 
  Successful logistics management ensures that there's no delay in delivery at any point in the chain and that products and services are delivered in good condition. This helps keep the company's costs down.
 
 
    What Is the Flow of Manufacturing Costs?    
  Efficient supply chain systems can get each piece of the product to the location where it's needed when it's needed. This requires control of the flow of manufacturing costs.
 
 
  The flow of manufacturing costs is most relevant to businesses that produce products that require many parts from several vendors. A clothing manufacturer might need deliveries of","By

"New Economy: Definition, History, and Examples of Companies","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the New Economy?    
  New economy is a buzzword to describe new, high-growth industries that are on the cutting edge of technology and are believed to be the driving force of  economic growth  and productivity. A new economy was first declared in the late 1990s as hi-tech tools, particularly the Internet and increasingly powerful computers, made their way into the consumer and business marketplace. The new economy was seen as a shift from a manufacturing and commodity-based economy to one that used technology to create new products and services at a rate that the traditional manufacturing economy could not match.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 New economy is a  buzzword  that was used to add to the hype of what tech companies in the 1990s were promising in terms of new ways of doing business and earning a living. 
 As originally coined, the new economy is here, with more people using technology in their daily lives. 
 The companies at the forefront of the new economy have become larger than many of the traditional manufacturing companies they were predicted to replace in terms of importance. 
 More recently, the term new economy has also been used to refer to a redesign of the capitalist system around environmental and social goals. 
 
 
    Understanding the New Economy    
  The idea that a new economy had arrived was part of the hysteria surrounding the  tech bubble  of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The new economy was variously heralded as the  knowledge economy , the data economy, the ecommerce economy, and so on. Unfortunately for the long-term health of the new economy arising in the 90s, investors and financial institutions bid up technology sector stock prices to unprecedented highs without fully considering the fundamentals. The excitement around the tech sector did more harm than good, and the rate at which these firms were pushed to become the next Microsoft likely destroyed many potentially good business ideas in the pursuit of great ones. 1 
 
 
  Although the tech bubble has long since burst, many of the remaining firms like Google (Alphabet), Amazon, and Meta (formerly Facebook) remain very innovative and at the forefront of technology. Now the new economy is often used to describe different aspects of the technology sector beyond simple Internet presence and functionality. Since the tech boom of the 90s, we've seen the growth of many new and exciting subsectors in tech. These include the  sharing economy , the streaming economy, the  gig economy , cloud computing,  big data , and  artificial intelligence . As of 2024, the companies involved in tech, particularly Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple, have overtaken most companies in the world in terms of market cap. 2 
 
 
    Are We in the New Economy?    
  The question ever since the bursting of the tech bubble is, of course, whether or not the new economy is here or still on the horizon. Certainly the traditional manufacturing economy is being increasingly automated using innovations coming out of the tech sector. Of course, we still buy and sell products, but the service economy—enabled by technology—is becoming an ever-growing part of the global economy.
 
 
 
 
  So we are definitely living in an economy that is qualitatively different from the one in the 1980s. Less people are employed in direct manufacturing and many of us are more anxious of being replaced by a machine than the old fear of having our job outsourced to a nation with a cheaper cost structure. Now that the new economy appears to be here, many people are not as confident that it was the one they wanted after all. 
 
 
    New Economy and the Restructuring of Capitalism    
  Although the term new economy developed as an investment buzzword around the promise of early Internet companies to change the world, the term has also been associated with calls to redesign the global economic system. The demand for a new economy in term of a total redesign of global capitalism has been put forth by people who see this as a necessary step to meet social and environmental goals. In this context, a new economy is one that focuses less on driving profits to shareholders through management and more on good corporate citizenship, positive community impacts, and distributing asset ownership differently.
 
 
  A complete overhaul of capitalism is quite challenging given the entrenched interests, although some investors have found ways to work within the system with  ESG investing . This approach rewards companies that act in ways that are more socially and environmentally beneficial even if doing so limits bottom line profits. The impact of this movement is just starting to be felt in the publicly traded market and has yet to reach private equity and the more aggressive corners of finance.
 
 
  While the new economy in the technology sense was largely welcomed and is just now being regretted by those who were negatively impacted, a new economy in terms of r","By

 Definition 
 Gross margin is the percentage of money a company keeps from its sales after covering the direct costs of producing its goods or services. It shows how efficiently a business turns revenue into profit before accounting for overhead and other expenses. 
    What Is Gross Margin?    
  Gross margin is the percentage of a company's revenue that's retained after direct expenses such as labor and materials have been subtracted. It's an important profitability measure that looks at a company's  gross profit  as compared to its revenue.
 
 
   Gross profit is determined  by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue. The higher the gross margin, the more revenue a company retains. It can then use the revenue to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Gross margin measures a company's gross profit compared to its revenues as a percentage. A higher gross margin means a company retains more capital. A company may cut labor costs or source cheaper suppliers if its gross margin drops. Gross margin focuses on revenue and COGS, unlike the net profit margin, which takes all of a business's expenses into account. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    Formula and Calculation of Gross Margin    
   Gross Margin = ( Net sales-COGS Net Sales ) × 1 0 0 \begin{aligned}&\text{Gross Margin}=\bigg(\frac{\text{Net sales-COGS}}{\text{Net Sales}}\bigg)\times100\end{aligned} ​ Gross Margin = ( Net Sales Net sales-COGS ​ ) × 1 0 0 ​ 
 Net Sales is the equivalent to revenue or the total amount of money generated from sales for the period. It can also be referred to as net sales because it can include discounts and deductions from returned merchandise. Revenue is typically called the top line because it appears at the top of the income statement. Costs are subtracted from revenue to calculate net income or the bottom line. 
 COGS stands for ""cost of goods sold."" The direct costs associated with producing goods include both direct labor costs and any costs of materials used in producing or manufacturing a company’s products. 
 Imagine that a business collects $200,000 in sales revenue. Let's assume that the cost of goods consists of the $100,000 it spends on manufacturing supplies. The gross profit is, therefore, $100,000 after subtracting its COGS from sales. The gross margin is 50% or ($200,000 - $100,000) ÷ $200,000.
 
 
 
 
    What Gross Margin Can Tell You    
  A company's gross margin is the percentage of  revenue  after COGS. It's calculated by dividing a company's gross profit by its sales. Gross profit is a company's revenue less the cost of goods sold. A company's gross margin is 35% if it retains $0.35 from each dollar of revenue generated.

  Companies use gross margin to measure how their production costs relate to their revenues. A company might strive to slash labor costs or source cheaper suppliers of materials if its gross margin is falling, or it may decide to increase prices as a revenue-increasing measure.

"Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Explained, With Pros and Cons","Definition 
 A non-disclosure agreement is a legal contract that protects confidential information by preventing those who sign it from disclosing the information to others. 
    What Is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)?    
  A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between two parties: one that holds sensitive information and the other that will receive that sensitive information.
 
 
  The latter agrees that the information they receive won't be made available to others. An NDA is also referred to as a confidentiality agreement.
 
 
  Non-disclosure agreements are common for businesses entering into negotiations with other businesses.
 
 
  They allow the parties to share sensitive information without fear that it will end up in the hands of competitors. It may be called a mutual non-disclosure agreement in this case.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An NDA acknowledges a confidential relationship between two or more parties and protects the information they share from disclosure to outsiders. The NDA is commonly implemented before discussions between businesses about potential joint ventures begin. Employees are often required to sign NDAs to protect an employer's confidential business information. An NDA may also be referred to as a confidentiality agreement. Mutual and non-mutual agreements are two primary types of non-disclosure agreements. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Violating an NDA can lead to legal action, including lawsuits. 
 Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    Understanding Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)    
  The NDA serves a purpose in a  variety of situations . NDAs are generally required when two companies enter into discussions about  doing business together  but want to protect their interests and the details of any potential deal.
 
 
 
 
  The language of the NDA forbids all involved from releasing information regarding any business processes or plans of the other party or parties.
 
 
  Some companies also require that new employees sign NDAs if they have access to sensitive information about the company.
 
 
  Some companies require all employees to sign an agreement while others require only certain employees, e.g., those in select departments, to sign them.
 
 
  NDAs may also be implemented before discussions take place between a company seeking funding and potential investors. The NDA is meant to prevent competitors from obtaining their  trade secrets  or business plans in such cases.
 
 
  Many investors are reluctant to sign NDAs, however. Not only will this potentially prevent them from sourcing future deals with other companies but the agreement may be very difficult to enforce in proving wrongdoing.
 
 
  Most investors simply won't sign the agreement so as to avoid being burdened by a legal contract even after declining an investment opportunity.
 
 
  The information that's being protected may include a  marketing strategy  and sales plan, names of potential customers, details about a manufacturing process, or proprietary software.
 
 
  If an NDA is breached, the initiating party may seek court action to prevent any further disclosures and sue the offending party for monetary damages.
 
 
    Types of NDAs    
  NDAs come in various forms, each providing for different rules and purposes.
 
 
    The Mutual Agreement    
  Consider a situation where two businesses are discussing the possibility of partnering. As part of strategic discussions, each company may disclose information about its  operations  to better inform the other side of its capabilities.
 
 
  In such situations, both parties often agree to share no information with others—the agreement is mutual.
 
 
    The Non-Mutual Agreement    
  This type of agreement is also referred to as a unilateral NDA. It usually applies to new employees who have access to sensitive information about the company.
 
 
  The employee is the only party signing the agreement and is prevented from sharing confidential information in such cases. They are the only one bound to confidentiality because they're the only party receiving sensitive information.
 
 
    The Disclosure Agreement    
  Increasingly, individuals are asked to sign the opposite of a non-disclosure agreement. A doctor may require a patient to sign a disclosure agreement that allows the doctor to share the patient's medical details with an  insurer .
 
 
  The disclosure agreement provides the doctor with the authority to share personal information and prevents them from being sued for doing so.

"What Was Form 1040EZ, and Why Is It No Longer Used?","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Form 1040EZ, which is no longer used, was the shortest and most straightforward version of Form 1040. 
    What Was Form 1040EZ: Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers with No Dependents?    
  IRS Form 1040EZ: Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers with No Dependents was the shortened version of the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  Form 1040. This form was for taxpayers with basic tax situations and offered a fast and easy way to file income taxes. 
 
 
  The form was discontinued as of the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned  Form 1040 . 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Form 1040EZ was a shortened version of Form 1040 for taxpayers with basic tax situations. The form was discontinued as of the 2018 tax year and replaced with the redesigned Form 1040. Form 1040EZ could only be used by people with no dependents who were younger than age 65 and earned less than $100,000 per year. 1040EZ was about one-fifth as long as the full 1040 form, with fewer deductions and tax credits. 
 
    Eligibility for Form 1040EZ    
  To use the form, a taxpayer had to have taxable income of less than $100,000, less than $1,500 of interest income, and claim no dependents. 2  Other requirements for filing the Form 1040EZ included:c
 
 
 
 The taxpayer and their spouse, if married filing jointly, had to be under age 65 at the end of the relevant filing period. 
 They could not be  blind as of the end of the relevant filing period . 
 The filer could take no deductions for student loan interest, educator expenses, tuition and fees, or itemized deductions. 
 If the filer received interest income, they could not have been required to file Schedule B, didn’t have amounts in boxes 11, 12, or 13 of Form 1099-INT or boxes 6 and 10 of Form 1099-OID, and didn’t earn any interest as a nominee. 
 Tax credits for retirement savings, health coverage, and education were not allowed. 
 The tax filer could not have received any advance  earned income  credit (EIC) although they would have been allowed to claim the EIC when filing Form 1040EZ. 
 The filer could not be a debtor in any Chapter 11  bankruptcy  case that was filed after October 16, 2005. 
 The filer (and their spouse, if married filing jointly), didn’t receive any advance payments of the premium tax credit offered for health coverage plans sold on the Marketplace. 
 The filer didn’t owe any household employee taxes on wages paid to household employees. 2 
 
 
 
 
    Limitations of Form 1040EZ    
  Form 1040EZ was ultimately scrapped due to the limitations of the form. The IRS opted for the building block approach of allowing taxpayers to more easily add allowances or credits as applicable to their return. In addition, Form 1040EZ had several other drawbacks.
 
 
  First, the form could only be used by those who earned less than a certain amount of income. The types of eligible income was also limited. Anyone who had income from sources other than wages, salaries, tips, taxable scholarships, or fellowship grants could not use Form 1040EZ. This precluded any taxpayer who received foreign income (or filed using a foreign address) from using the form. In addition, any taxpayer hoping to claim a dependent could also not use Form 1040EZ.
 
 
  With Form 1040EZ, taxpayers were not allowed to itemize their deductions nor were they able to take other types of deductions, such as the student loan interest deduction or deductions for  individual retirement account (IRA)  contributions.
 
 
    Form 1040EZ vs. Form 1040    
  Form 1040EZ had only a few credits or  deductions  available to taxpayers. Filers were able to include an  earned income credit  and elect nontaxable combat pay. 2 
 
 
  For most tax years, Form 1040 had 80% more lines than form 1040EZ. One significant difference was that Form 1040 had fields to include information about dependents, while 1040EZ did not allow individuals to claim  dependents . Similar to the standard form, the EZ version had sections to record wages, salaries and tips, and taxable interest under $1,500. The filer was also able to include unemployment compensation payments. 3 4 
 
 
   1982 
 The first year that Form 1040EZ was introduced. 5 
 
  Form 1040EZ allowed filers to claim income from wages, tips, salaries, taxable grants or scholarships, the Alaska Permanent Fund, and unemployment compensation. 4 
 
 
  Form 1040, in contrast, had at least 16 income categories. 3  Categories available on the standard form included  dividend  payments, retirement account distributions, and farm and rental income. Form 1040 also allowed the entry of  Social Security benefits , alimony, and other forms of income. This form also had a long list of deductions, ranging from education costs to healthcare savings plan contributions. 3 
 
 
    Transition Away From Form 1040EZ    
  In 2018, the IRS replaced Forms 1040A and 1040EZ with a redesigned Form 1040. This new Form 1040 included six new numbered schedules in addition to the","By

"Juris Doctor (JD): Definition, Requirements, History, and Jobs","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Juris Doctor (JD)?    
  A Juris Doctor (JD) is a three-year professional degree that confers recognition that the holder has a professional degree in law. Upon completion of a JD. program and passing the bar exam, individuals are eligible to practice law in their jurisdiction. This means they can represent clients, provide legal advice, and advocate for their clients in court.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The American law degree, called a Juris Doctor (JD), is a three-year professional degree. Law school applicants must already have a bachelor's degree. It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass the bar exam to practice law. Drexel, Rutgers, Columbia, and Fordham are among the schools that offer a two-year J.D. degree option. 
 
    Understanding Juris Doctor (JD)    
  A JD degree is a professional graduate degree in law. It is the standard degree required to practice law in the United States and in most other common law jurisdictions. Most JD programs typically involves three years of full-time study or its equivalency in part-time studies.
 
 
  Some schools offer a joint J.D. and  MBA  degree so that students can complete both degrees in less time than it would take to complete each separately. Other combined graduate degrees include public policy, medicine, and bioengineering.
 
 
  Law school applicants must already have a  bachelor's degree . It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass the  bar  exam to practice law. Each state and the District of Columbia has its own bar exam.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Obtaining a JD degree is different than passing the bar. Most often, students pursue the materials needed to pass the bar as part of their JD studies. 
 
 
 
    History of the JD Degree    
  The first lawyers trained in the United States underwent an apprenticeship and training with a lawyer who served as a mentor. The first formal law degree granted in the country was a Bachelor of Law from the College of William and Mary in 1793. Harvard University changed the name of the degree to the Latin ""Legum Baccalaureus,"" known as the LL.B., and led the 19th-century movement for a scientific study of law. 1 2  The LL.B. remains the standard degree in most of the Commonwealth of Nations.

  The faculty of Harvard Law School first suggested changing the degree from LL.B. to J.D. in 1902 to reflect the professional nature of the degree. In 1903, the University of Chicago, which was one of only five law schools that required students to have a bachelor's degree before enrollment, granted the first J.D. degree. 1  Many law schools offered both an LL.B. to students who entered without a bachelor's degree and a J.D. to students entering with a bachelor's degree.
 
 
  By the early 1960s, most students entered law school with a bachelor's degree. In 1965, the American Bar Association recommended the standard law degree be the J.D., and that decree took effect by the end of the decade. 3 
 
 
    Requirements for a JD Degree    
  In order to get into law school, you must have an undergraduate degree, have passed the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), request your official transcripts from your undergraduate institution(s), obtain letters of recommendation, and write a personal statement.
 
 
    Complete a Bachelor's Degree    
  While many graduate programs require the completion of certain prerequisite courses, there are no such requirements for prospective law students. However, you must have earned (or be on track to earn) an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution. Your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) is a key indicator law schools consider when evaluating applicants.
 
 
    Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT)    
  You'll also need to take the LSAT. The basic fee for the LSAT during the 2024-2025 academic year is $238 plus $207 for Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and an additional $45 fee for each CAS report sent to the law schools you apply to. Most people end up paying $500 or more in total LSAT fees. 4 
 
 
  It is generally recommended that you spend at least three months studying for the exam, although many people dedicate up to a year studying for the exam. There are many resources online to help you study for the LSAT, including free resources. Organized prep courses that guide you through the different components of the LSAT can be quite expensive. Some individuals opt to hire a private tutor to help them prepare for the LSAT.

"Basket of Goods: Definition, CPI Calculation, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A basket of goods is a collection of consumer items and services used to measure inflation by tracking price changes over time. 
    What Is a Basket of Goods?    
  A basket of goods is a collection of items that represent consumer spending patterns. It is made up of a fixed set of goods and services whose prices are used to measure inflation. These prices are monitored each month by federal governments so they can set and make changes to their  inflation targets . For example, the  consumer price index (CPI) , a common measure of inflation, measures the price change over time for a basket of goods and services. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks this basket of goods in the United States. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A basket of goods represents consumer spending and is used to track changes in the prices of consumer goods and services over time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks 80,000 prices monthly to assess inflation for more than 200 categories of products and services. 1 The prices of goods and services are gathered mostly from visits by BLS data collectors to some 23,000 retail and service outlets in 75 urban areas. Data on rents are collected from about 50,000 landlords or tenants. 2 CPI calculations factor in consumer substitution of items rising in price with alternatives and filter out price increases reflecting product improvements. 
 
    Understanding a Basket of Goods    
  The concept of a basket of goods is central to understanding economic  trends  and measuring  inflation . By tracking a representative sample of items, economists can gauge changes in the cost of living and consumer prices over time.
 
 
  The composition of this basket can vary by country and can be influenced by numerous factors, including technological advancements, government policies, and shifts in consumer behavior. This  basket  can also change over time; we'll look at this more closely in the article.
 
 
  The basket of goods can also highlight the interconnection between various  economic sectors . For example, changes in transportation costs can affect food prices due to shipping expenses, while fluctuations in utility costs can influence housing affordability.
 
 
 
 
  Policymakers rely on these types of relationships to better understand the implications of the policies they consider implementing.
 
 
    Basket of Goods Deconstructed    
  With 80,000 prices sampled monthly for more than 200 categories of products and services, the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  is using a huge basket, because its goal is to get an accurate measure of price changes for consumer goods and services across the U.S. economy. 1 
 
 
  Broad  consumer spending  categories like food, energy, apparel, and services include subcategories tracking inflation for everything from apples and premium unleaded gasoline to men's underwear and funerals. 3 
 
 
  The prices of goods and services are gathered mostly from visits by BLS data collectors to some 23,000 retail and service outlets in 75 urban areas. Data on rents are collected from about 50,000 landlords or tenants. 4 
 
 
  Items for sampling at each outlet are selected randomly based on odds proportional to how much spending they attract relative to category alternatives in terms of brand, variety, and size or weight. Items remain in the sample for four years. 5 
 
 
    How the Government Calculates CPI    
  After the prices are collected, BLS product specialists make adjustments to ensure the price changes are measuring inflation rather than the cost of product improvements in items such as autos, consumer appliances, and electronics.
 
 
  The prices are used to calculate basic indexes for 211 goods, services, and housing item categories for 32 geographic areas subdividing all U.S. urban areas. The BLS then calculates more than 7,776 item-area combination basic indexes in a way that factors in the substitution of cheaper items for more expensive ones within and between spending categories. 6 
 
 
  All those item-area indexes are then weighed based on recent two-year results from a detailed  consumer spending  survey to calculate two versions of the consumer price index: 6 
 
 
 
 The  CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)  reflects the spending patterns of over 90% of the U.S. population living in areas where the BLS collects price data. It is the basis of the headlines about the rate of change in consumer prices, or the inflation rate. 4 
 The  CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)  covers approximately 30% of the population and is limited to households with income derived predominantly from clerical or wage-paying occupations. 4 
 
 
  The CPI-W is used to adjust  Social Security  payments and federal income tax brackets for inflation. 7 8

"Mutually Exclusive: What It Means, With Examples","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Mutually exclusive events or factors cannot coexist in the same place and time. 
    What Is Mutually Exclusive?    
  The concept of mutually exclusive events or factors comes from the field of statistics, where it describes two or more things that cannot happen simultaneously. That is, one must supersede the others, like war and peace or making a left turn and a right turn at the same time.
 
 
  Mutual exclusivity has been extended into the world of business and finance, where it informs the decision-making processes on opportunities to be pursued or dropped.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The concept of mutual exclusivity often arises in the business world in the processes of budgeting and dealmaking. 
 If considering mutually exclusive options, a company weighs the  opportunity cost , or the benefits that will be lost if another option is chosen. 
 The  time value of money  (TVM) is also considered when choosing among mutually exclusive choices. 
 A choice is not mutually exclusive if two or more options can exist simultaneously. 
 
 
    Understanding Mutually Exclusive    
  Mutually exclusive events cannot happen simultaneously, but should not be considered independent events. Independent events have no impact on the viability of other options. For a basic example, consider the rolling of dice. You cannot roll a five and a three simultaneously on a single die. However, you can roll a five and a three on two dice.
 
 
  The fact that one die cannot roll two different numbers means the outcome is mutually exclusive. Rolling a five on one and a three on the other means they are not mutually exclusive outcomes.
 
 
    Opportunity Cost    
  When faced with a choice between mutually exclusive options, a company must consider the  opportunity cost , which is what the company would be giving up to pursue each option. The concepts of opportunity cost and mutual exclusivity are inherently linked because each mutually exclusive option requires the sacrifice of whatever profits could have been generated by choosing the alternate option.

  The  time value of money  (TVM) and other factors make mutually exclusive analysis a bit more complicated. For a more comprehensive comparison, companies use  net present value  (NPV) and  internal rate of return  (IRR) formulas to mathematically determine which project is most beneficial when choosing between two or more mutually exclusive options.
 
 
    Example of Mutually Exclusive    
  The concept of mutual exclusivity is often applied in  capital budgeting . Companies may have to choose between multiple projects that will add value to the company upon completion. Some of these projects are mutually exclusive.
 
 
  For example, assume a company has a budget of $50,000 for expansion projects. If available Projects A and B each cost $40,000 and Project C costs only $10,000, then Projects A and B are mutually exclusive. If the company pursues A, it cannot also afford to pursue B and vice versa. Project C may be considered independent. Regardless of which other project is pursued, the company can still afford to pursue C as well. The acceptance of either A or B does not impact the viability of C, and the acceptance of C does not impact the viability of either of the other projects.
 
 
  Moreover, when looking at opportunity costs, consider the analysis of Projects A and B. Assume that Project A has a potential return of $100,000, while Project B will only return $80,000. Since A and B are mutually exclusive, the opportunity cost of choosing B is equal to the profit of the most lucrative option (in this case, A) minus the profits generated by the selected option (B); that is, $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000. Because option A is the most lucrative option, the opportunity cost of going for option A is $0.
 
 
   What Is Meant by Mutually Exclusive? 
 Mutually exclusive means two events that cannot simultaneously occur. For example, in corporate finance, a company might consider spending a certain amount of capital on one of two projects. Because of the cost and available funds, only one project can be spent on, making them mutually exclusive. 
 
 
   What's the Difference Between Mutually Exclusive and Independent? 
 Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time, while independent events have no influence on each other's occurrence. 
 
 
   What Is an Example of Mutually Exclusive in Everyday Life? 
 Consider a road. You can choose to go left or right at a fork, but not both. 
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  Things that are mutually exclusive are not able to occur simultaneously. In business, this is typically concerning the undert","By

"Kurtosis: Definition, Types, and Importance","Definition 
 Kurtosis is a measurement used in financial analysis to gauge an investment’s risk of price volatility. 
    What Is Kurtosis?    
  Kurtosis is a statistical measure used to describe a characteristic of a dataset. It generally takes the form of a bell when normally distributed data is plotted on a graph. This is called the bell curve. The plotted data that are farthest from the  mean  of the data usually form the tails on each side of the curve. Kurtosis indicates how much data resides in the tails. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Kurtosis describes the “fatness” of the tails found in probability distributions. There are three kurtosis categories: mesokurtic (normal), platykurtic (less than normal), and leptokurtic (more than normal). Kurtosis risk is a measurement of how often an investment’s price moves dramatically. A curve’s kurtosis characteristic tells you how much kurtosis risk there is for the investment you’re evaluating. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Jessica Olah / Investopedia 
 
    How Kurtosis Works    
  Kurtosis is a measure of the combined weight of a distribution’s tails relative to the center of the distribution curve referred to as the mean. It shows a peak when a set of approximately normal data is graphed via a histogram with most of the data residing within three standard plus or minus deviations of the mean. The tails extend farther than the three standard deviations of the normal bell-curved distribution when high kurtosis is present, however.
 
 
  Kurtosis is sometimes confused with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution but kurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution’s tails in relation to its overall shape. A distribution can be sharply peaked with low kurtosis and a distribution can have a lower peak with high kurtosis so kurtosis measures “tailedness” not “peakedness.”
 
 
  Distributions with a large kurtosis have more tail data than normally distributed data, which appears to bring the tails in toward the mean. Distributions with low kurtosis have fewer tail data, which appears to push the tails of the bell curve away from the mean.
 
 
 
 
  High kurtosis of the return distribution curve implies that there have been many positive or negative price fluctuations in the past away from the average returns for the investment. An investor might experience extreme price fluctuations with an investment with high kurtosis. This phenomenon is known as kurtosis risk.
 
 
    Formula and Calculation of Kurtosis    
  There are several different methods for calculating kurtosis.
 
 
    Calculating With Spreadsheets    
  The simplest way to calculate is to use the Excel or Google Sheets formula. Assume you have the following sample data: 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, and 8 residing in cells A1 through A10 on your spreadsheet. The spreadsheets use this formula for calculating kurtosis: 1 
 n ( n + 1 ) ( n − 1 ) ( n − 2 ) ( n − 3 ) × ( ∑ x i − x ˉ s ) 4 − 3 ( n − 1 ) 2 ( n − 2 ) ( n − 3 ) \begin{aligned}& \frac { n ( n + 1 ) }{ (n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) } \times \Big ( \sum \frac { x_i - \bar{x} }{ s } \Big ) ^ 4 - \frac { 3 (n - 1) ^ 2 }{ (n - 2)(n - 3)} \\\end{aligned} ​ ( n − 1 ) ( n − 2 ) ( n − 3 ) n ( n + 1 ) ​ × ( ∑ s x i ​ − x ˉ ​ ) 4 − ( n − 2 ) ( n − 3 ) 3 ( n − 1 ) 2 ​ ​ 
 We’ll use the following formula in Google Sheets which calculates it for us, assuming the data resides in cells A1 through A10: 2 
 = KURT(A1:A10) \begin{aligned}&= \text{KURT(A1:A10)} \\\end{aligned} ​ = KURT(A1:A10) ​ 
 The result is a kurtosis of -0.1518, indicating that the curve has lighter tails and is platykurtic.
 
 
    Calculating by Hand    
  Calculating kurtosis by hand is a lengthy endeavor and it takes several steps to get to the results. We’ll use new data points and limit their number to simplify the calculation. These data points are 27, 13, 17, 57, 113, and 25.
 
 
   Important 
 It’s important to note that a sample size should be much larger than this. We're using six numbers to reduce the calculation steps. A good rule of thumb is to use 30% of your data for populations under 1,000. You can use 10% for larger populations. 3 
 
 
 
  You must first calculate the mean. Add up the numbers and divide by six to get 42. Next use the following formulas to calculate two sums: s2 (the square of the deviation from the mean) and s4 (the square of the deviation from the mean squared). Note that these numbers do not represent standard deviation. They represent the variance of each data point. 4 5 
 s2 = ∑ ( y i − y ˉ ) 2 s4 = ∑ ( y i − y ˉ ) 4 where: y i = ith variable of the sample y ˉ = Mean of the sample \begin{aligned}&\text{s2} = \sum ( y_i - \bar{y} ) ^ 2 \\&\text{s4} = \sum ( y_i - \bar{y} ) ^ 4 \\&\textbf{where:} \\&y_i = \text{ith variable of the sample} \\&\bar{y} = \text{Mean of the sample} \\\end{aligned} ​ s2 = ∑ ( y i ​ − y ˉ ​ ) 2 s4 = ∑ ( y i ​ − y ˉ ​ ) 4 where: y i ​ = ith variable of the sample y ˉ ​ = Mean of the sample ​

    What Is a Prospectus?    
  A prospectus is a written document used in finance to inform the public of the relevant details about an offering of securities, such as stocks,  bonds , and  mutual funds . The prospectus is part of a company's registration statement, which must be filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . 1 
 
 
  Key details on a prospectus include the number of units, the offering price, and how the company intends to use the capital it raises from the sale. Companies update their prospectuses each year. Investors can obtain prospectus reports by visiting the SEC EDGAR database. 2  However, investors will also find that the  best online brokerage and trading platforms  provide access to prospectus reports, which may be easier to read.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A prospectus is a document companies use to give the public relevant information about an offering of securities. The information in a prospectus includes the company's profile, the securities offered, investment objectives, the use of capital, and risk factors. Investors can use the prospectus to help them make important investment decisions. Companies must file prospectuses with the SEC and use them as marketing and sales tools. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Components of a Prospectus    
  The prospectus is a required disclosure document. As such, it must include all material information about the company, the offering, and any other relevant details.
 
 
 
 Company information:  The prospectus should outline information about the company, how it operates, and its products and services.

 Withholding tax is the income tax an employer deducts from an employee's paycheck. 
    What Is Withholding Tax?    
  The term ""withholding tax"" refers to the money that an employer deducts from an employee’s gross wages and pays directly to the government. The amount withheld is a credit against the income taxes the employee must pay during the year.
 
 
  The vast majority of people who are employed in the United States are subject to tax withholding. Nonresident aliens are also subject to withholding taxes on earned income as well as on other income such as interest and  dividends  from the securities of U.S. companies that they own. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Withholding  tax is a set amount of income tax that an employer withholds from an employee’s paycheck. 
 Employers remit withholding taxes directly to the IRS in the employee's name. 
 The tax withholding is a credit against the employee’s annual income tax bill. 
 If too much money is withheld, an employee receives a tax refund; if too little is withheld, they may have to pay the IRS more with their tax return. 
 Withholding tax is deducted from payments to U.S. residents and nonresidents who earn money from American sources.

    Understanding Withholding Tax    
  Tax withholding is a way for the U.S. government to maintain its pay-as-you-go (or  pay-as-you-earn ) income tax system. This means taxing individuals at the source of  income  rather than trying to collect income tax after wages are earned. 
 
 
    Here's How It Works    
  Whenever an employee gets paid, their employer withholds a certain percentage of their paycheck as  income tax . This is then paid by the employer to the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) .
 
 
 
 
  The amount deducted appears on the employee's paystub and the total amount deducted annually can be found on  Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement . Employers send W-2s to their employees each year to help them file their annual income tax returns.
 
 
  The amount deducted depends on a  number of factors . These considerations include the amount an employee earns, filing status, any withholding allowances claimed by the employee, and whether an employee requests that additional income be withheld. If merited, any excess is paid back to the employee by the IRS as a tax refund. 1 
 
 
   Tip 
 The IRS suggests verifying your withholding tax early in the year and whenever any changes are made to the tax law. You should also check it whenever you have changes in your lifestyle (filing status, marriage, divorce), wages, or when tax credits and deductions are changed. 1 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  The majority of U.S. states also have  state income taxes  and employ tax withholding systems to collect taxes from their residents. States use a combination of the IRS W-4 Form and their own worksheets, which residents fill out to establish their withholding.
 
 
   Nine states  do not impose income tax on residents. They are: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Withholding tax only applies to capital gains for high-earners living in Washington.
 
 
  New Hampshire residents pay tax on interest and dividend income only. 2  However, they voted to gradually phase out this practice by 2027. 3 4 
 
 
    History of Withholding Taxes    
  Tax withholding first occurred in the U.S. in 1862 at the order of President Abraham Lincoln to help finance the Civil War. The federal government also implemented  excise taxes  for the same purpose. Tax withholding and income tax were abolished after the Civil War in 1872. 5 6 
 
 
  The current system was accompanied by a large tax hike when it was implemented in 1943. 5  At the time, it was thought that it would be difficult to collect taxes without getting them from the source. Most employees are subject to withholding taxes when they are hired and fill out a  W-4 Form . The form estimates the amount of taxes that will be due. 7 
 
 
  The withholding tax is one of two types of  payroll taxes . The other type is paid to the government by the employer and is based on an individual employee’s wage","0 seconds of 1 minute, 30 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholdingtax.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
How Importing and Exporting Impacts the Economy,"Overseas products or imports provide more choices to consumers. They help them manage their strained household budgets because they're usually manufactured more cheaply than any domestically produced equivalent so they cost less. It can distort a nation’s  balance of trade  and devalue its currency, however, when there are too many imports coming into a country in relation to its exports.
 
 
  The devaluation of a country's currency can have a huge impact on the everyday life of a country's citizens. The value of a currency is one of the biggest determinants of a nation’s economic performance and its gross domestic product (GDP). Maintaining the appropriate balance of imports and exports is crucial for a country. Its importing and  exporting activity  can influence the country's GDP, its exchange rate, and its level of inflation and interest rates.
 
 
  Price changes in imports and exports are tracked by the  Import/Export Index (MXP)  released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A country's importing and exporting activity can influence its GDP, its exchange rate, and its level of inflation and interest rates. A rising level of imports and a growing trade deficit can have a negative effect on a country's exchange rate. A weaker domestic currency stimulates exports and makes imports more expensive. A strong domestic currency hampers exports and makes imports cheaper. Higher inflation can also impact exports by having a direct impact on input costs such as materials and labor. 
 
    Effect on Gross Domestic Product    
  Gross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measurement of a nation's overall economic activity. Imports and exports are important components of the  expenditure method  of calculating  GDP . The formula for GDP is: 
 GDP = C + I + G + ( X − M ) where: C = Consumer spending on goods and services I = Investment spending on business capital goods G = Government spending on public goods and services X = Exports M = Imports \begin{aligned} &\text{GDP} = C + I + G + ( X - M ) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &C = \text{Consumer spending on goods and services} \\ &I = \text{Investment spending on business capital goods} \\ &G = \text{Government spending on public goods and services} \\ &X = \text{Exports} \\ &M = \text{Imports} \\ \end{aligned} ​ GDP = C + I + G + ( X − M ) where: C = Consumer spending on goods and services I = Investment spending on business capital goods G = Government spending on public goods and services X = Exports M = Imports ​ 
 
 
 Exports minus imports (X – M) equals net exports in this equation. The net exports figure is positive when exports exceed imports. This indicates that a country has a trade surplus. The net exports figure is negative when exports are less than imports. This indicates that the nation has a  trade deficit . 
 A trade surplus contributes to  economic growth  in a country. It means that there's a high level of output from a country's factories and industrial facilities as well as a greater number of people that are being employed to keep these factories in operation when there are more exports. It also equates to a flow of funds into the country which stimulates  consumer spending  and contributes to economic growth when a company is exporting a high level of goods. 
 It represents an outflow of funds from that country when a country is importing goods. Local companies are the importers and they make payments to overseas entities, the exporters. A high level of imports indicates robust domestic demand and a growing economy.  It's even more favorable for a country if these imports are mainly productive assets such as machinery and equipment because productive assets will improve the economy's productivity over the long run. 
 
 
   Important 
 A healthy economy is one where both exports and imports are experiencing growth. This typically indicates economic strength and a sustainable trade surplus or deficit. It may indicate that foreign economies are in better shape than the domestic economy if exports are growing but imports have declined significantly. It may indicate that the domestic economy is faring better than overseas markets if exports fall sharply but imports surge. 
 
 
 
  The U.S. trade deficit tends to worsen when the economy is growing strongly. This is the level at which U.S. imports exceed U.S. exports. The U.S.’s chronic trade deficit hasn't impeded it from continuing to have one of the most productive economies in the world, however. 1 
 
 
  A rising level of imports and a growing trade deficit can hurt one key economic variable, however: a country's exchange rate, the level at which their domestic currency is valued versus foreign currencies. 2 
 
 
    Impact on Exchange Rates    
  There's a constant feedback loop between international trade and the way a country's  currency is valued . The exchange rate affects the trade surplus or deficit which in turn affects the exchange rate.

Volatility: Meaning in Finance and How It Works With Stocks,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Volatility is a statistical measurement of the degree of variability of the return of a security or market index. 
    What Is Volatility?    
  Volatility is a measurement of how varied the returns of a given security or market index are over time. It is often measured from either the standard deviation or variance between those returns. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.
 
 
  In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big price swings, either up or down. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than 1% over a sustained period of time, it is called a volatile market.
 
 
  An asset’s volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Volatility represents how greatly an asset’s prices swing around the mean price. 
 There are several ways to measure volatility, including beta coefficients, option pricing models, and  standard deviation  of returns. 
 Volatile assets are often considered riskier than less volatile assets because the price is expected to be less predictable. 
 Implied volatility measures how volatile the market will be, while historical volatility measures price changes over past time periods. 
 Volatility is an important variable in the calculation of options prices. 
 
 
    Understanding Volatility    
  Volatility often refers to the amount of uncertainty or  risk  related to the size of changes in a security’s value.
 
 
  A higher volatility means that a security’s value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can move dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that a security’s value does not fluctuate dramatically, and tends to be steadier.

  One way to measure an asset’s variation is to quantify the daily returns (percent move on a daily basis) of the asset. Historical volatility is based on historical prices and represents the degree of  variability  in the returns of an asset. 1  This number is without a unit and is expressed as a percentage. 2 
 
 
 
 
  While  variance  captures the  dispersion  of returns around the mean of an asset in general, volatility is a measure of that variance bounded by a specific time period. Thus, we can report daily, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility. It is useful to think of volatility as the annualized  standard deviation .
 
 
    How to Calculate Volatility    
  Volatility is often calculated using variance and standard deviation (the standard deviation is the square root of the variance). Since volatility describes changes over a specific period of time, you simply take the standard deviation and multiply that by the square root of the number of periods in question:
 
 
  Volatility = σ√T
 
 
  where:
 
 
   σ = standard deviation of returns T = number of periods in the time horizon 
 
 
    Volatility and Stocks    
  For simplicity, let’s assume we have monthly stock  closing prices  of $1 through $10. For example, month one is $1, month two is $2, and so on. To calculate variance, follow the five steps below.
 
 
 
 Find the  mean  of the data set.  This means adding each value and then dividing it by the number of values. If we add $1, plus $2, plus $3, all the way to up to $10, we get $55. This is divided by 10 because we have 10 numbers in our data set. This provides a mean, or average price, of $5.50. 
 Calculate the difference between each data value and the mean.  This is often called deviation. For example, we take $10 - $5.50 = $4.50, then $9 - $5.50 = $3.50. This continues all the way down to the first data value of $1. Negative numbers are allowed. Since we need each value, these calculations are frequently done in a spreadsheet. 
 Square the deviations.  This will eliminate negative values. 
 Add the squared deviations together.  In our example, this equals 82.5. 
 Divide the sum of the squared deviations (82.5) by the number of data values.  In this case, the resulting variance is $8.25. 
 
 
  Next, take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation. This equals $2.87. This is a measure of risk and shows how values are spread out around the average price. It gives traders an idea of how far the price may deviate from the average.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Sabrina Jiang / Investopedia 
 
  If prices are randomly sampled from a normal  distribution , then about 68% of all data values will fall within one standard deviation. Ninety-five percent of data values will fall within two standard deviations (2 × 2.87 in our example), and 99.7% of all values will fall withi","By

CBOE Volatility Index (VIX): What Does It Measure in Investing?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the Fear Index, measures expected market volatility using a portfolio of options on the S&P 500. 
    What Is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)?    
  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time index that represents the market’s expectations for the relative strength of near-term price changes of the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Because it is derived from the prices of SPX index options with near-term expiration dates, it generates a 30-day forward projection of volatility.  Volatility , or how fast prices change, is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment, and in particular the degree of fear among market participants.
 
 
  The index is more commonly known by its ticker symbol and is often referred to simply as “the VIX.” It was created by the CBOE Options Exchange and is maintained by CBOE Global Markets. It is an important index in the world of trading and investment because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors’ sentiments.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Investors use the VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. Traders can also trade the VIX using a variety of options and exchange-traded products, or they can use VIX values to price derivatives. The VIX generally rises when stocks fall, and declines when stocks rise. 
 
    How Does the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Work?    
  The VIX attempts to measure the magnitude of price movements of the S&P 500 (i.e., its volatility). The more dramatic the price swings are in the index, the higher the level of volatility, and vice versa.
 
 
  In addition to being an index to measure volatility, traders can also trade VIX futures, options, and ETFs to hedge or speculate on volatility changes in the index.
 
 
  In general, volatility can be measured using two different methods. The first method is based on historical volatility, using statistical calculations on previous prices over a specific time period. This process involves computing various statistical numbers, like  mean  (average),  variance , and finally, the  standard deviation  on the historical price data sets.

  The second method, which the VIX uses, involves inferring its value as implied by options prices. Options are derivative instruments whose price depends upon the probability of a particular stock’s current price moving enough to reach a particular level (called the  strike price  or  exercise price ).
 
 
  Since the possibility of such price moves happening within the given time frame is represented by the volatility factor, various option pricing methods (like the  Black-Scholes model ) include volatility as an integral input parameter.
 
 
  Since option prices are available in the open market, they can be used to derive the volatility of the underlying security. Such volatility, as implied by or inferred from market prices, is called forward-looking  implied volatility  (IV).
 
 
    Extending Volatility to Market Level    
  The VIX was the first benchmark index introduced by CBOE to measure the market’s expectation of future volatility.
 
 
  Being a forward-looking index, it is constructed using the implied volatilities on S&P 500  index options  and represents the market’s expectation of 30-day future volatility of the S&P 500 Index, which is considered the leading indicator of the broad U.S. stock market. 1 
 
 
  Introduced in 1993, the VIX is now an established and globally recognized gauge of U.S. equity market volatility. It is calculated in real time based on the live prices of the S&P 500 Index. Calculations are performed and values are relayed from 3 a.m. to 9:15 a.m., and from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. EST. CBOE began the dissemination of the VIX outside of U.S. trading hours in April 2016. 1 
 
 
    Calculation of VIX Values    
  VIX values are calculated using the CBOE-traded standard SPX options, which expire on the third Friday of each month, and the weekly SPX options, which expire on all other Fridays. Only SPX options are considered whose expiry period lies within more than 23 days and less than 37 days. 2 
 
 
  While the formula is mathematically complex, it theoretically works as follows: It estimates the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index by aggregating the weighted prices of multiple SPX puts and calls over a wide range of strike prices. 3

What Are Stock Fundamentals?,"What Are Stock Fundamentals?    
  Stock fundamentals are key metrics for a company, such as cash flow and  return on assets  (ROA). Analysts often perform  fundamental analysis  to analyze a stock by looking at its fundamentals. This involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Fundamental analysis involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock. Some of the fundamentals of stocks include cash flow, return on assets, and conservative gearing. Performing fundamental analysis can be challenging because it requires digging through financial statements to know when the stock price is wrong. 
 
    How Stock Fundamentals Work    
  In the broadest terms, fundamental analysis involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or  perceived value  of a stock. This is, of course, anything aside from the trading patterns of the stock itself, As the name implies, it means getting down to basics.
 
 
  Fundamental analysis focuses on creating a portrait of a company, identifying the fundamental value of its shares, and buying or selling the stock based on that information. Some of the indicators commonly used to assess company fundamentals include: 1 
 
 
 
 Cash flow 
 Return on assets 
 Conservative gearing 
 History of profit retention for funding future growth 
 The soundness of capital management for the maximization of shareholder earnings and returns 
 
 
  Fundamental analysts have a staid approach to analyzing stock performance. They look at a variety of factors that they believe influence a stock's performance. These include the industry as a whole, the competition, a company's management structure, its income and  revenue , as well as its growth potential.
 
 
    Example of Stock Fundamentals    
  All of the data is public and readily available, generally through a company's  financial statements . The goal is to ultimately identify which stocks are priced correctly—and incorrectly—by the market.
 
 
 
 
  To help you visualize it, let's use the following analogy. Think of the  stock market  as a shopping mall, where stocks are the items for sale in the retail outlets. Their sights are set solely on the products in the mall. Shoppers are dismissed as an unreliable, emotional herd with no inkling of the  real value  of the goods for sale.
 
 
  Fundamental analysts move slowly through the stores seeking the best deals. Once the crowd moves on from, say, the personal computers (PCs), they will take a closer look at the ones that were passed over.
 
 
  Fundamental analysts may take a stab at determining the  scrap value  of the PC stripped down to its hard disk, memory cards, monitor, and keyboard. In the stock market, this is akin to calculating the book value, or  liquidation  price, of a company.
 
 
  These analysts also take a very close look at the quality of the PC. Is it going to last or will it break down within a year? The fundamental analysts will pore over the specifications, scrutinize the manufacturer's  warranty , and consult  consumer reports . Similarly, equity analysts check a company's balance sheet for financial stability.
 
 
  Then, the fundamental analysts may try to understand the performance of the PC in terms of, say, processing power, memory, or image resolution. These are like the forecast  earnings  and dividends identified from a company's income statement.
 
 
  Finally, the fundamental analysts will put together all the data and come up with the  intrinsic value , or value independent of the current sale price. If the sale price is less than the calculated intrinsic value, the fundamentalists will buy PCs. If not, they will either sell the PCs they already own or wait for prices to fall before buying more.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Performing fundamental analysis can be a lot of hard work. But that is, arguably, the source of its appeal. By taking the trouble to dig into a company's financial statements and assessing its future prospects, investors can learn enough to know when the stock price is wrong.
 
 
  These conscientious investors are able to spot the market's mistakes and make themselves money. At the same time, buying companies based on intrinsic,  long-term  value protects investors from the dangers of day-to-day market fluctuations.
 
 
  However, the fact that fundamental analysis shows that a stock is  undervalued  does not guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value any time soon. Things are not so simple. In reality, real share price behavior relentlessly calls into question almost every stock holding, and even the most independently-minded investor can start doubting the merits of fundamental analysis. There is no magic formula for figuring out intrinsic value.

 Definition 
 A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate and sells shares to raise capital to do so. 
    What Is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)?    
  Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate across a wide range of property sectors. These investments allow you to earn  income  from  real estate  without having to buy, manage, or finance properties themselves.
 
 
  Created by a 1960 law, REITs were designed to make real estate investing more accessible so smaller  investors  could invest in a portfolio of skyscrapers, shopping malls, or apartment complexes with the same ease as buying stocks. By pooling capital from many investors, REITs have changed and funded much of American real estate, often in ways few in the public understand. Below, we’ll explore how they work, what benefits and risks you need to know about, and how to invest in them.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 REITs own, run, use, work, or finance income-producing properties. REITs generate a steady income stream for investors but offer little capital appreciation. Most REITs are publicly traded like stocks, which makes them highly liquid, unlike traditional real estate investments.  A sizeable minority of REITs are private funds whose shares are only eligible to accredited investors. REITs invest in apartment buildings, cell towers, data centers, hotels, medical facilities, offices, retail centers, and warehouses.

  Congress established REITs in 1960 through an amendment to the Cigar Excise Tax Extension. 1  The provision enabled firms to pool capital from investors to buy large  real estate portfolios . 2  REITs operate like mutual funds—firms manage pools of funds for the sake of many investors—but for real estate instead of stocks and bonds. Investors earn returns in two ways: from dividends or an increase in the value of the REIT’s shares. 3 
 
 
  Central to REITs is that they take the quintessential example of illiquid assets—real estate—and make them liquid. REITs invest in all kinds of properties: apartment complexes, data centers, healthcare facilities, hotels, infrastructure (fiber cables, cell towers, and energy pipelines), office buildings, retail centers, self-storage units, timberland, and warehouses. REITs tend to specialize in specific real estate sectors, like commercial properties. However, many hold diversified portfolios of many kinds of properties. 4 
 
 
 
 
  As you can see below, the amount investors have pooled in REITs has risen significantly in the past quarter century—almost exactly tenfold. Also notable is the undulation of the line graph as market bubbles inflate, crises and recessions arrive, and interest rates shift. Often thought of as the most stable of stock assets—after all, the sector includes the ground beneath your feet—the value of real estate and, thus, the returns from REITs are certainly not.
 
 
 
 
    What Qualifies As a REIT?    
  Most REITs lease space, collect rent on properties, and distribute that income as dividends to shareholders. A small percentage of REITs, called mortgage REITs, earn money from financing real estate, not owning it. In the mid-2020s, they account for about 4% of REIT assets in the United States.
 
 
  To qualify as a REIT, a company must meet several requirements set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 5  These include the following:

 A general ledger stores and organizes the data that are itemized in a firm’s financial statements. 
    What Is a General Ledger?    
  A general ledger represents the record-keeping system for a company’s financial data, with debit and credit account records validated by a trial balance. It provides a record of each financial transaction that takes place during the life of an operating company and holds account information that is needed to prepare the company’s financial statements. Transaction data is segregated by type into accounts for assets, liabilities, owners’ equity, revenues, and expenses.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A general ledger is the foundation of a company’s double-entry accounting system. General ledger accounts encompass transaction data needed to produce an income statement, balance sheet, and other financial reports. General ledger transactions summarize transactions made as journal entries to sub-ledger accounts. The trial balance is a report that lists every general ledger account and its balance, making adjustments easier to check and errors easier to locate.

    How a General Ledger Works    
  A general ledger is the foundation of a  system employed by accountants  to store and organize financial data used to create the firm’s financial statements. Transactions are posted to individual sub-ledger accounts as defined by the company’s  chart of accounts .
 
 
  The transactions are then closed out or summarized in the general ledger, and the accountant generates a trial balance. This balance serves as  a report of each ledger account’s balance . The trial balance is checked for errors and adjusted by posting additional necessary entries, and then the adjusted trial balance is used to generate the financial statements.
 
 
    How a General Ledger Functions With Double-Entry Accounting    
  A general ledger is used by businesses that employ the  double-entry  bookkeeping method, which means that each financial transaction affects at least two sub-ledger accounts, and each entry has at least one debit and one credit transaction. Double-entry transactions, called journal entries, are posted in two columns, with debit entries on the left and credit entries on the right, and the  total of all debit and credit entries  must balance. 1 
 The  accounting equation , which underlies double-entry accounting, is as follows: 
 
 Assets − Liabilities = Stockholders’ Equity \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Stockholders' Equity} Assets − Liabilities = Stockholders’ Equity 
 
 The  balance sheet  follows this format and shows information at a detailed account level. For example, the balance sheet shows several asset accounts, including cash and accounts receivable, in its short-term assets section. 
 The double-entry accounting method works based on the accounting equation’s requirement that transactions posted to the accounts on the left of the equal sign in the formula must equal the total of transactions posted to the account (or accounts) on the right.  
 
 Even if the equation is presented differently (such as Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity),  the balancing rule always applies . 
 The table below is a simple example of what a double-entry general ledger may look like.

"What Is a Junk Bond? Definition, Credit Ratings, and Example","What Is a Junk Bond?    
  Junk bonds are bonds that carry a higher risk of default than most bonds issued by corporations and governments. A bond is a debt or promise to pay investors interest payments along with the return of invested principal in exchange for buying the bond. Junk bonds represent bonds issued by companies that are financially struggling and have a high risk of  defaulting  or not paying their interest payments or repaying the principal to investors.
 
 
  Junk bonds are also called  high-yield  bonds since the higher yield is needed to help offset any risk of default.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A junk bond is debt that has been given a low credit rating by a ratings agency, below investment grade. As a result, these bonds are riskier since chances that the issuer will default or experience a credit event are higher. Because of the higher risk, investors are compensated with higher interest rates, which is why junk bonds are also called high-yield bonds. 
 
    Junk Bonds Explained    
  From a technical viewpoint, a high-yield, or ""junk"" bond is very similar to regular corporate bonds. Both represent debt issued by a firm with the promise to pay interest and to return the principal at maturity. Junk bonds differ because of their issuers' poorer credit quality.
 
 
  Bonds are fixed-income debt instruments that corporations and governments issue to investors to raise capital. When investors buy bonds, they're effectively loaning money to the issuer who promises to repay the money on a specific date called the maturity date. At maturity, the investor is repaid the principal amount invested. Most bonds pay investors an annual interest rate during the life of the bond, called a coupon rate.
 
 
  For example, a bond that has a 5% annual coupon rate means that an investor who purchases the bond earns 5% per year. So, a bond with a $1,000 face—or par—value will receive 5% x $1,000 which comes to $50 each year until the bond matures.
 
 
    Higher Risk Equates to Higher Yield    
  A bond that has a high risk of the underlying company defaulting is called a junk bond. Companies that issue junk bonds are typically start-ups or companies that are struggling financially. Junk bonds carry risk since investors are unsure whether they'll be repaid their principal and earn regular interest payments. As a result, junk bonds pay a higher yield than their safer counterparts to help compensate investors for the added level of risk. Companies are willing to pay the high yield because they need to attract investors to fund their operations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pros 
 
 
 Junk bonds return higher yields than most other fixed-income debt securities. 
 Junk bonds have the potential of significant price increases should the company's financial situation improve. 
 Junk bonds serve as a risk indicator of when investors are willing to take on risk or avoid risk in the market. 
 
 
 
 
 Cons 
 
 
 Junk bonds have a higher risk of default than most bonds with better credit ratings. 
 Junk bond prices can exhibit volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the issuer's financial performance. 
 Active junk bond markets can indicate an overbought market meaning investors are too complacent with risk and may lead to market downturns. 
 
 
 
 
    Junk Bonds as a Market Indicator    
  Some investors buy junk bonds to profit from potential price increases as the financial security of the underlying company improves, and not necessarily for the return of interest income. Also, investors that predict bond prices to rise are betting there will be increased buying interest for high-yield bonds—even these lower rated ones—due to a change in  market risk sentiment . For example, if investors believe economic conditions are improving in the U.S. or abroad, they   might purchase junk bonds of companies that will show improvement along with the economy.
 
 
  As a result, increased buying interest of junk bonds serves as a market-risk indicator for some investors. If investors are buying junk bonds, market participants are willing to take on more risk due to a perceived improving economy. Conversely, if junk bonds are selling off with prices falling, it usually means that investors are more  risk averse  and are opting for more secure and stable investments.
 
 
  Although a surge in junk bond investing usually translates to increased optimism in the market, it could also point to too much optimism in the market.
 
 
  It's important to note that junk bonds have much larger price swings than bonds of higher quality. Investors looking to purchase junk bonds can either buy the bonds individually through a broker or invest in a junk bond fund managed by a professional portfolio manager.
 
 
    Improving Financials Affect Junk Bonds    
  If the underlying company performs well financially, its bonds will have improved credit ratings and usually attract buying interest from investors.

 The interest coverage ratio reveals a company’s solvency and ability to pay interest on its debt. 
    What Is the Interest Coverage Ratio?    
  The interest coverage ratio is a debt and profitability ratio. It shows how easily a company can pay  interest  on its outstanding  debt . The ratio divides a company’s  earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)  by its interest expense over a specific period.
 
 
  The interest coverage ratio may be called the  times interest earned (TIE) ratio . It helps lenders, investors, and creditors determine a company’s riskiness for future borrowing.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The interest coverage ratio measures how well a company can pay the interest due on outstanding debt. The ratio is found by dividing a company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense during a given period. The interest coverage ratio helps lenders, investors, and creditors determine a company’s riskiness for future borrowing. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A higher ICR suggest a stronger ability to pay interest and a lower risk of default. 
 Laura Porter / Investopedia 
 
    Formula and Calculation    
   
 Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT Interest Expense where: EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxes \begin{aligned} &\text{Interest Coverage Ratio}=\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{EBIT}=\text{Earnings before interest and taxes} \end{aligned} ​ Interest Coverage Ratio = Interest Expense EBIT ​ where: EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxes ​ 
 The “coverage” represents the number of times a company can successfully  pay its obligations  with its earnings.  A low ratio may signal that the company has high debt expenses with minimal capital. For example, when a company’s interest coverage ratio is 1.5 or lower, it can only cover its obligations a maximum of one and a half times. Its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable in the long run. 
 Companies need earnings to cover interest payments and survive unforeseeable financial hardships. A company’s ability to meet its interest obligations is an aspect of its  solvency  and a factor in the return for  shareholders .
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 When corporate interest rates rise, interest coverage ratios may decline. Rising rates limit profits and hurt a company’s ability to borrow, invest, and hire new employees. 1 
 
 
 
    Earnings Variations    
 
 EBITDA : Uses  earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)  instead of EBIT in calculating the interest coverage ratio. This variation excludes depreciation and amortization. Calculations using EBITDA produce a higher interest coverage ratio than calculations using EBIT. 
 EBIAT : Uses  earnings before interest after taxes (EBIAT) , deducting taxes from the numerator to render a more accurate picture of a company’s ability to pay its interest expenses.

 The Fed uses open market operations to keep the federal funds rate at its established target. 
    What Are Open Market Operations (OMOs)?    
  Open market operation (OMO) is a term that refers to the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by the  Federal Reserve  (Fed). The Fed conducts open market operations to regulate the supply of money that is on reserve in U.S. banks. The Fed purchases Treasury securities to increase the money supply and sells them to reduce it.
 
 
  By using OMOs, the Fed can adjust the federal funds rate, which in turn influences other short-term rates, long-term rates, and foreign exchange rates. This can change the amount of money and credit available in the economy and affect certain economic factors, such as unemployment, output, and the costs of goods and services.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Open market operations are one of three tools used by the Fed to affect the availability of money and credit. The term refers to a central bank buying or selling securities in the open market to influence the money supply. Buying securities adds money to the system, lowers rates, makes loans easier to obtain, and increases economic activity. Selling securities removes money from the system, raises rates, makes loans more expensive, and decreases economic activity. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   OMOs can help manage inflation and stimulate economic growth .

    Understanding Open Market Operations (OMOs)    
  To understand open market operations, you first have to understand how the Fed, the  central bank  of the U.S., implements the nation's  monetary policy .
 
 
  To keep the U.S. economy on an even keel and to forestall the ill effects of uncontrolled price inflation or deflation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets what's called a target  federal funds rate . 1 
 
 
  The federal funds rate is the interest rate that  depository  institutions charge each other for overnight loans. This constant flow of money allows banks to earn a return on excess cash in their Fed balances while maintaining the reserves required to meet the demands of customers. 2

  As a benchmark, the federal funds rate influences a variety of other rates, from savings deposit rates to  home mortgage rates  and credit card interest rates. 1 
 
 
  Open market operations is one of the tools that the Fed uses to keep the federal funds rate at its established target.
 
 
  The U.S. central bank can lower the interest rate by purchasing securities (and injecting money into the money supply). Similarly, it can sell securities from its balance sheet, take money out of circulation, and put upward pressure on interest rates.
 
 
  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets a target federal funds rate and then the   Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) implements the open market operations to achieve that rate. 3 
 
 
    Types of Open Market Operations    
  There are two types of OMOs: permanent open market operations and temporary open market operations.

    What Is Hyperinflation?    
  Hyperinflation is a term that describes and measures rapid, excessive, and out-of-control general price increases that result in extreme inflation.  Inflation  measures the pace of rising prices for goods and services in an economy. Hyperinflation indicates uncontrollable price increases over a defined period, typically measuring more than 50% per month.
 
 
  Hyperinflation is a rare event for developed economies but it's occurred many times throughout history in countries such as China, Germany, Russia, Hungary, and Georgia.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Hyperinflation refers to rapid and unrestrained price increases and inflation in an economy over time, typically at rates exceeding 50% each month. Hyperinflation can occur in circumstances affecting the underlying production economy in conjunction with a central bank printing excessive money. Hyperinflation can cause a surge in prices for essential goods such as food and fuel as demand outpaces supply. Hyperinflation scenarios are typically rare but they can spiral out of control when they begin. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Matthew Collins 
 
    Understanding Hyperinflation    
  Inflation is measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using the  Consumer Price Index  (CPI) to measure the dollar's purchasing power in the U.S. The CPI is an index of the prices for about 94,000 commodities and services: approximately 8,000 rental housing unit quotes and prices for airline fares, apparel, household goods, prescription drugs, used automobiles, and postage. 1 
 
 
  The Federal Reserve generally strives to maintain what it calls a  healthy inflation rate  of around 2% over the long term. 2  Hyperinflation is an extreme case of inflation. Inflation higher than 5% is considered high inflation. Inflation of 50% or more per month is considered hyperinflation. 3 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The U.S. inflation rate measured by the CPI averaged about 2.5% per year from 2013 through 2021. It reached a peak of 13.54% in 1980. It was 4.11% as of July 2024. 4 
 
 
 
  Prices may increase daily or weekly in an environment of hyperinflation and this can have a dramatic impact on what consumers pay for basic necessities. Imagine that you always buy the same items at the grocery store. Your grocery bill would rise from $500 one week to $675 the next week then as high as $911 the week after that if the economy were experiencing a rising inflation rate of 5% per day.

    Causes of Hyperinflation    
  Several circumstances can trigger hyperinflation.
 
 
    Excessive Money Supply    
  Central banks generally control the circulating supply of money. Central banks can increase the amount of money circulating in circumstances that historically warrant an increase in the money supply such as a  recession  or  depression . The intent behind this action is to encourage banks to lend and consumers and businesses to borrow and spend. 
 
 
  Hyperinflation can result if the increase in money supply isn't supported by economic growth as measured by  gross domestic product  (GDP, the measure of an economy's production. Businesses raise prices to boost profits and stay afloat if GDP isn't growing.

 Definition 
 A Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan funded using after-tax dollars. 
  A Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings account that is funded using after-tax dollars. This means that income tax is paid immediately on the earnings that the employee deducts from each paycheck and deposits into the account. As long as certain conditions are met—that is, you must be at least 59½ years old, and you must have had the account for at least five years—withdrawals from the account are  tax free  upon retirement.
 
 
  This type of plan is different from a traditional  401(k)  plan, which is funded with pretax money. In this case, payroll deductions come out of the employee’s gross income and taxes are due when the money is withdrawn from the account. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A Roth 401(k) is a type of employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. Contributions made to a Roth 401(k) are taxed, but earnings and withdrawals made during retirement are tax free. Contribution limits are adjusted annually for inflation and are announced each year by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Penalties apply if you make withdrawals before you turn 59½ or if you’ve had the account for less than five years.

    How Roth 401(k)s Work    
  Investors have many options when it comes to saving for retirement. One of the most common ways to put money aside is through employer-sponsored plans like the  401(k) . Participation is voluntary and those who take part agree to automatic  payroll deductions  that are transferred into a special retirement account. Some employers even  match employee contributions  up to a certain amount. 1 
 
 
  There are  several varieties of 401(k)s . The Roth 401(k) option became available at the beginning of 2006, while the traditional 401(k) has been around since 1978. Both were authorized by Congress as  tax-advantaged  retirement plans to encourage employees to save for their retirement. 2 3 4

 A traditional 401(k) reduces the employee’s gross income for the year, giving them an instant tax break in addition to a  retirement savings  vehicle. The employee will owe regular  income tax  on every withdrawal made during retirement. 
 The Roth 401(k) requires that the income tax be paid immediately, so the employee’s real  net income  is reduced by the amount earmarked for savings. But no further taxes will be owed on withdrawals of either the contributions or the profits earned over the years.

"Mixed Economic System: Characteristics, Examples, Pros & Cons","What Is a Mixed Economic System?    
  A mixed economic system is one that combines aspects of both  capitalism  and  socialism . A mixed economic system accepts private property and permits economic freedom in the use of capital, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic activities in order to achieve social aims.
 
 
  According to neoclassical theory, mixed economies are less efficient than pure free markets. However, proponents of government intervention argue that the base conditions required for efficiency in free markets, such as equal information and rational market participants, cannot be achieved in practical application.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 A mixed economy is an economy organized with some free-market elements and some socialistic elements; it lies on a  continuum between  pure capitalism and pure socialism. 
 Mixed economies typically accept private ownership of most means of production, with some government intervention, mainly through  regulations . 
 Mixed economies socialize select industries that are deemed essential or that produce public goods. 
 All known historical and modern economies are examples of mixed economies. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Nez Riaz 
 
    Understanding Mixed Economic Systems    
  Most modern economies feature elements of multiple different economic systems. In mixed economies, the public sector works alongside the private sector, though they may compete for the same limited resources. Mixed economic systems do not block the  private sector  from profit-seeking, but they do regulate business and may nationalize industries that provide a  public good .
 
 
  For example, the  United States is a mixed economy , as it leaves ownership of the means of production in mostly private hands but incorporates elements such as subsidies for agriculture, regulation on manufacturing, and partial or full public ownership of some industries like letter delivery and national defense. In fact, all known historical and modern economies fall somewhere on the continuum between pure socialism and pure capitalism, which represent theoretical constructs. 1 
 
 
 
 
    Mixed Economy vs. Free Markets    
  Mixed economic systems are not  laissez-faire  systems, because the government is involved in planning the use of some resources and can exert control over businesses in the private sector. Governments may seek to redistribute wealth by taxing the private sector and by using funds from taxes to promote social objectives.

  Trade protection,  subsidies , targeted  tax credits , fiscal  stimulus , and  public-private partnerships  are common examples of government intervention in mixed economies. These unavoidably generate economic distortions, but they are instruments aimed to achieve specific goals.
 
 
  Countries may also intervene in markets to promote targeted industries, such as by creating  agglomerations  or reducing barriers to entry. This was common among East Asian countries in the 20th-century, which saw a development strategy known as  export-led growth . Today, the region has turned into a global manufacturing center.
 
 
  Some nations have come to specialize in textiles, while others are known for machinery, and others are hubs for electronic components. These  sectors  rose to prominence after governments protected young companies as they achieved competitive scale and promoted adjacent services such as shipping.
 
 
    Mixed Economy vs. Socialism    
  A key element of socialism is common or centralized ownership of the means of production. 2  Proponents of socialism believe that central planning can achieve a greater good for a larger number of people.
 
 
  Socialists do not trust that the free-market outcomes will achieve the efficiency and optimization posited by  classical economists , so socialists advocate the nationalization of all industries and the expropriation of privately owned capital goods, lands, and natural resources. Mixed economies rarely go to this extreme. Instead, they identify only select instances in which intervention could achieve outcomes unlikely to be achieved in free markets.
 
 
  Such measures can include price controls, income redistribution, and intense regulation of production and trade. This also includes the socialization of specific industries, known as  public goods , that are considered essential and that economists believe the free market might not supply adequately, such as public utilities, military and police forces, and environmental protection.  Unlike pure socialism , however, mixed economies usually otherwise maintain private ownership and control of the means of production.","By

 Definition 
 Valuation is the process of estimating the current or projected value of an asset or a company. 
    What Is Valuation?    
  Valuation is a process in which an analyst uses a company's latest financial to determine its current or projected valuey. Many techniques are used for doing a valuation. Among other metrics, an analyst placing a value on a company looks at the business's management, the composition of its  capital structure , the prospect of future earnings, and the  market value  of its assets.
 
 
   Fundamental analysis  is often employed in valuation although several other methods may be employed such as the  capital asset pricing model  (CAPM) or the  dividend discount model  (DDM).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Valuation is a quantitative process of determining the fair value of an asset, investment, or firm. A company can generally be valued on its own on an absolute basis or a relative basis compared to other similar companies or assets. Several methods and techniques can be used to arrive at a valuation, each of which may produce a different value. Valuations can be quickly impacted by corporate earnings or economic events that force analysts to retool their valuation models. Valuation is quantitative in nature but it often involves some degree of subjective input or assumptions. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A common way to value a business is determining the fair value of all of its assets minus all of its liabilities. 
 Investopedia / Mira Norian 
 
    Understanding Valuation    
  A valuation can be useful when you're trying to determine the  fair value  of a security determined by what a buyer is willing to pay a seller assuming that both parties enter the transaction willingly. Buyers and sellers determine the  market value  of a stock or bond when a security trades on an exchange.
 
 
  The concept of  intrinsic value  refers to the perceived value of a security based on future earnings or some other company attribute. It's unrelated to the market price of a security and this is where valuation comes into play. Analysts do a valuation to determine whether a company or asset is  overvalued or undervalued  by the market.
 
 
 
 
    Types of Valuation Models    
 
 Absolute valuation models  attempt to find the intrinsic or ""true"" value of an investment based only on fundamentals. You would focus only on things such as dividends, cash flow, and the growth rate for a single company. You wouldn't worry about any other companies. Valuation models that fall into this category include the dividend discount model, discounted cash flow model, residual income model, and asset-based model. 1 
 Relative valuation  models  operate by comparing the company in question to other similar companies. These methods involve calculating multiples and ratios such as the price-to-earnings multiple and comparing them to the multiples of similar companies. 2

  The original company might be considered undervalued if the P/E is lower than the P/E multiple of a comparable company. The relative valuation model is typically a lot easier and quicker to calculate than the absolute  valuation  model. This is why many investors and analysts begin their analysis with this model.

Year-Over-Year (YOY): What It Means and How It's Used in Finance,"Definition 
 Year-over-year (YOY) is a method of measuring growth that compares a statistic, such as revenue in one time period with the same time period one year earlier. 
    What Is Year-Over-Year (YOY)?    
  Year-over-year (YOY)—sometimes referred to as year-on-year—is a frequently used financial comparison for looking at two or more measurable events on an annualized basis. Observing YOY performance allows for gauging if a company’s  financial performance  is improving, static, or worsening. For example, you may read in financial reports that a particular business reported that its revenues increased for the third quarter on a YOY basis for the last three years.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Year-over-year (YOY) is a method of evaluating two or more measured events to compare the results at one period with those of a comparable period on an annualized basis. YOY comparisons are a popular and effective way to evaluate the financial performance of a company. Investors seeking to gauge a company’s financial performance use YOY reporting. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Candra Huff 
 
    How Year-Over-Year (YOY) Works    
  Year-over-year compares a company's financial performance in one period with its numbers for the same period one year earlier. This is considered more informative than a month-to-month comparison, which often reflects seasonal trends.
 
 
  Common YOY comparisons include annual and quarterly as well as monthly performance.
 
 
    Benefits of Year-Over-Year (YOY)    
  YOY measurements facilitate the cross-comparison of sets of data. For a company’s first-quarter revenue using YOY data, a financial analyst or an investor can compare years of first-quarter revenue data and quickly ascertain whether a company’s revenue is increasing or decreasing.
 
 
 
 
  By comparing the same months in different years, it is possible to draw accurate comparisons despite the seasonal nature of consumer behavior. This YOY comparison is also valuable for investment portfolios. Investors like to examine YOY performance to see how performance changes over time.

    Uses of Year-Over-Year (YOY)    
  YOY comparisons are popular when analyzing a company’s performance because they help mitigate  seasonality , a factor that can influence most businesses. Sales, profits, and other financial metrics change during different periods of the year because most lines of business have a peak season and a low-demand season.
 
 
  For example, retailers have a peak demand season during the holiday shopping season, which falls in the fourth quarter of the year. To properly quantify a company’s performance, it makes sense to compare revenue and profits YOY.
 
 
  It’s important to compare the fourth-quarter performance in one year to the fourth-quarter performance in other years. Suppose an investor looks at a retailer’s results in the fourth quarter versus the prior third quarter. In that case, it might appear that a company is undergoing unprecedented growth when seasonality influences the difference in the results.
 
 
  Similarly, in a comparison of the fourth quarter with the following first quarter, there might appear to be a dramatic decline, when this could also be a result of seasonality.
 
 
  YOY also differs from the term  sequential , which measures one quarter or month to the previous one and allows investors to see linear growth. For instance, the number of cell phones a tech company sold in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter or the number of seats an airline filled in January compared with December.
 
 
    Example of Year-Over-Year (YOY)    
  Below is Apple's income statement from Q1 2025. Total net sales for the quarter were $124.3 billion. Total net sales for Q1 2024 were $119.6 billion. This means that Apple's net sales in Q1 2025 were up 3.9% year-over-year (YOY). 1 
 
 
  For Q1 2025, Apple's net income was $36.3 billion, which was an increase when compared to its net income of $33.9 billion in Q1 2024. This was a 7.07% increase year-over-year. 1 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Apple 
 
   What Is YOY Used for? 
 YOY is used to compare one time period and another one year earlier. This allows for an annualized comparison, say between third-quarter earnings this year versus third-quarter earnings the year before. It is commonly used to compare a company’s growth in profits or revenue, and it can also be used to describe yearly changes in an economy’s money supply,  gross domestic product (GDP) , and other economic measurements. 
 
 
   How Is YOY Calculated? 
 YOY calculations are straightforward and usually expressed in percentage terms. This would involve taking the current yea","By

"What Is Business Ethics? Definition, Principles, and Importance","What Is Business Ethics?    
  Business ethics is the moral principles, policies, and values that govern the way companies and individuals engage in business activity. It goes beyond legal requirements to establish a code of conduct that drives employee behavior at all levels and helps build trust between a business and its customers.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Business ethics refers to implementing appropriate business policies and practices with regard to arguably controversial subjects. Some issues that come up in a discussion of ethics include corporate governance, insider trading, bribery, discrimination, social responsibility, and fiduciary responsibilities. The law usually sets the tone for business ethics, though doing the bare minimum is generally frowned upon. Developing ethical models and practices can boost a company's revenues, profits, and share price. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Katie Kerpel 
 
    Understanding Business Ethics    
  Business ethics ensure that a certain basic level of trust exists between consumers and various forms of market participants with businesses. For example, a  portfolio manager  must give the same consideration to the portfolios of family members and small individual investors as they do to wealthier clients. These kinds of practices ensure the public receives fair treatment.
 
 
  The concept of business ethics began in the 1960s as corporations became more aware of a rising consumer-based society that showed concerns regarding the environment, social causes, and corporate responsibility. The increased focus on ""social issues"" was a hallmark of the decade. 1 
 
 
  Since that time, the concept of business ethics has evolved. Business ethics goes beyond just a moral code of right and wrong; it attempts to reconcile what companies must do legally vs. maintaining a  competitive advantage  over other businesses. Firms display business ethics in several ways.
 
 
   Important 
 Business ethics ensure a certain level of trust between consumers and corporations, guaranteeing the public fair and equal treatment. 
 
 
 
    Principles of Business Ethics    
  There are generally 12 business ethics principles:
 
 
 
 
 
 Leadership : The conscious effort to adopt, integrate, and emulate the other 11 principles to guide decisions and behavior in all aspects of professional and personal life. 
 Accountability :  Holding yourself  and others responsible for their actions. Commitment to following ethical practices and ensuring others follow ethics guidelines. 
 Integrity : Incorporates other principles—honesty, trustworthiness, and reliability. Someone with integrity consistently does the right thing and strives to hold themselves to a higher standard. 
 Respect for others : To foster ethical behavior and environments in the workplace, respecting others is a critical component. Everyone deserves dignity, privacy, equality, opportunity, compassion, and empathy. 
 Honesty : Truth in all matters is key to fostering an ethical climate. Partial truths, omissions, and under or overstating don't help a business improve its performance. Bad news should be communicated and received in the same manner as good news so that solutions can be developed. 
 Respect for laws : Ethical leadership should include enforcing all local, state, and federal laws. If there is a legal grey area, leaders should err on the side of legality rather than exploiting a gap. 
 Responsibility : Promote ownership within an organization, allow employees to be responsible for their work, and be accountable for yours. 
 Transparency : Stakeholders are people with an interest in a business, such as shareholders, employees, the community a firm operates in, and the family members of the employees. Without divulging trade secrets, companies should ensure information about their financials, price changes, hiring and firing practices, wages and salaries, and promotions are available to those interested in the business's success. 
 Compassion : Employees, the community surrounding a business, business partners, and customers should all be treated with concern for their well-being. 
 Fairness : Everyone should have the same opportunities and be treated the same. If a practice or behavior would make you feel uncomfortable or place personal or corporate benefit in front of equality, common courtesy, and respect, it is likely not fair. 
 Loyalty : Leadership should demonstrate commitment to their employees and the company. Inspiring loyalty in employees and management ensures that they are committed to best practices. 
 Environmental concern : In a world where resources are limited, ecosystems have been damaged by past practices, and the climate is changing, it is of utmost importance to be aware of and concerned about the environmental impacts a business has. All employees should be encouraged to discover and report solutions for practices that can add to damages already done.

"Yearly Renewable Term (YRT): What It Is, How It Works","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)?    
  Yearly renewable term is a one-year temporary life insurance policy that automatically continues each year at the same death benefit. When someone buys a YRT insurance policy, the premium quoted is for one year of coverage based on the insured's current age. Premiums then increase annually to cover the increased risk of death as the insured ages while keeping their policy in-force.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A yearly renewable term is a one-year term life insurance policy. The policy can be extended into future years without additional underwriting but the premium will go up each year. When you buy a YRT policy, the premium quoted is for each one-year term, starting in the current year. If you renew for many years, you might end up paying more in premiums than if you'd bought a level term life or permanent life insurance policy. YRTs can often be converted to other types of insurance if your needs change over time. 
 
    Understanding Yearly Renewable Terms (YRTs)    
  Yearly renewable  term life insurance , or YRT, provides one year of insurance that pays a tax-free  death benefit  to the policy's beneficiaries if the insured dies during that 12-month period. Each year (unless the policy owner cancels the coverage or stops paying premiums), the YRT renews at the same death benefit but charges a higher premium that reflects the insured's higher age. This type of life insurance is also called increasing premium term insurance or annual renewal term insurance. 1 
 
 
  Actuaries at insurance companies determine what premium to charge for a  renewable term  policy, based on different risk variables. Using specific formulas that consider age, health, and other factors,  actuaries  can predict the likelihood a policyholder will die at a given age. Renewable term policies allow the policyholder to renew coverage each year without additional medical  underwriting  over a given period of time. YRT essentially actually functions as a series of one-year term policies that levy a new premium each year based on the insured's current age.
 
 
    Yearly Renewable Term Suitability    
  YRT policies tend to be attractive to young insurance seekers who want to start out with a low-cost, flexible premium to meet their current needs. YRTs also fill niche short-term demands, such as for those awaiting insurance coverage while changing jobs; people who recently quit smoking; those with short-term medical conditions; and others who might only need one to two years of coverage.
 
 
 
 
  The primary drawback of yearly renewable term life insurance is that if a policyholder renews for many years, they could end up paying more in premiums than if they'd started out buying a level term life or permanent life insurance policy. If someone buys a YRT policy and later realizes their coverage needs will last longer, the insurance company may let a policyholder convert the policy to  whole life insurance  without taking another medical exam. 2 
 
 
    Why Choose a Yearly Renewable Term    
  Policyholders with a yearly renewable term life insurance policy can lock in a length of time during which they will remain insurable. During this period, the policy can be renewed without the need for a medical exam. Renewability rules vary by state and insurer, but it is generally permissible up to a certain age. For example, New York doesn't allow you to renew past age 80 as the cost would be too high to be worth it. 3 
 
 
  The policyholder's age is a major factor in determining how  premiums  are priced, so YRTs are particularly attractive to adults at lower ages. A young insured person's premiums start lower and generally increase with age. That's because the older you get,  the more costly and risky  it becomes to insure you.
 
 
  Most policies come with a ""schedule of premiums."" This is a chart that outlines the maximum amount you'll have to pay each year. Premiums are billed for this exact amount when the policy is renewed. While the premiums usually increase, the death benefit stays the same.
 
 
   Why might you be interested in yearly renewable term life insurance? 
 YRTs offer flexible, low-cost coverage that appeals to those who only need insurance for a short period of time. Policyholders lock in a length of time during which they remain insurable. During this time, the policy can be renewed without the need for a medical exam. 
 
 
   What is the main drawback of YRT? 
 If a policyholder renews for many years, they could end up paying more in total premiums than if they'd simply bought a level term life or permanent life insurance policy. However, you may have the option to covert the YRT to a level premium term or whole life policy without additional medical exams or underwriting.

"Year-End Bonus Definition, Who Gets It, When, and Why?","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Year-End Bonus?    
  A year-end bonus refers to a form of compensation paid by employers to their employees in addition to their wages or salaries. Put simply, a year-end bonus is a reward that companies pay their workers.
 
 
  The amount paid can vary but is usually based on an employee's position and salary. It is commonly tied to performance metrics, which means it can depend on whether certain milestones are met. Year-end bonuses may be made in different forms, including lump-sum payments in cash, to reward individuals for their hard work and dedication. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A year-end bonus is a form of compensation that employers pay to their employees in addition to their regular earnings. This type of bonus is often tied to performance metrics. Bonuses can be made in cash as lump-sum payments or in other forms, such as stocks or paid time off. Employers and employees may arrange to have year-end bonuses paid in the following year for tax planning purposes. Use your bonus to spend, pay off debt, or save. 
 
    Understanding Year-End Bonuses    
   Compensation  comes in many forms. Depending on the nature of the work and the type of company, employers may offer their employees salaries, wages,  commissions , retirement plans, health benefits, stock options, and tips. Another type of compensation is the year-end bonus, which may also be called an annual or Christmas bonus.
 
 
  Year-end bonuses are offered by companies of different sizes, from small businesses to large  multinational corporations . As noted above, it is normally tied to an employee's performance over the calendar or fiscal year.
 
 
  So employees who meet their sales quotas or other metrics may qualify for one. In some cases, anyone who exceeds their goals may be entitled to higher bonuses. It isn't uncommon for top executives and employees of financial firms on Wall Street to receive large bonuses at the end of the year. 
 
 
   Important 
 If a company misses its targets or otherwise underperforms, a company may withhold year-end bonuses for some, if not all, individuals on the payroll. 
 
 
 
  Year-end bonuses are often paid in cash as lump sums. Some companies, though, may choose to compensate their employees in other ways. This may include supplemental  vacation  days, gifts, or in-kind transfers of stock. Bonuses fluctuate depending on the economy and the year's performance, but in most years the amount is substantial.
 
 
 
 
  Some companies may include these bonuses in their employees' contracts to encourage consistent results. Contractual year-end bonuses are more often offered to executive management when they are hired or promoted, and might not be tied to the company’s performance at all.
 
 
  In this capacity, the bonus can serve as a hiring and  retention tool  to keep key personnel on board with a company when job openings at rival companies offer higher base salaries.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Companies and employees may choose to defer payment of a year-end bonus until the next year. So rather than receiving it in December, an employee may receive their bonus in January or February.
 
 
  This option allows workers to push any additional tax burden to the next year. So although the employee qualifies for the bonus this year, the tax consequences don't apply until they receive the bonus the following year. This allows an employee to plan for the  windfall  at the end of the next year. 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Employers have remained cautious since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a 2023 survey, 34% of employers didn't give their employees a year-end bonus. Of those surveyed, 76% of the companies paying a bonus said they would keep the amount the same while 15% said they were decreasing the amount. 1

  There are several ways you can choose to use your year-end bonus. But before you do, it's always a good idea to weigh out the options so you make the right choice.
 
 
 
 Spend it. This is the first inclination that people have when it comes to their bonuses. Because it's a reward for good performance, you may be tempted to go shopping and make big purchases, whether the payout is big or small. Maybe you want a new TV or need a new laptop. Or you could use it to make those much-needed repairs on your car. 
 Pay down debt. This is extra cash that you may not have had, so it's always a good idea to clear your debt. You can pay down your credit cards and student loans. You may even choose to make a  prepayment  toward your mortgage to cut down your principal balance. 
 Put it into savings. If you have little to no debt, consider setting your bonus aside into a savings account, a  certificate of deposit (CD) , or another investment vehicle. If you have room, you may choose to put it into and top off your retirement account.

"Alpha: Its Meaning in Investing, With Examples","Definition 
 Alpha is a measure of an investment's performance that indicates its ability to generate returns in excess of its benchmark. 
    What Is Alpha?    
  Alpha (α) is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy’s ability to beat the market, or its “edge.” Alpha is thus also often referred to as  excess return  or the  abnormal rate of return  in relation to a benchmark, when adjusted for risk.
 
 
  Alpha is often used in conjunction with  beta  (the Greek letter β), which measures the broad market’s overall  volatility  or risk, known as  systematic market risk .
 
 
  Alpha is used in finance as a measure of  performance , indicating when a strategy, trader, or portfolio manager has managed to beat the market return or other benchmark over some period. Alpha, often considered the  active return  on an investment, gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market’s movement as a whole.
 
 
  The excess return of an investment relative to the  return  of a benchmark index is the investment’s alpha. Alpha may be positive or negative and is the result of active investing. Beta, on the other hand, can be earned through passive  index investing .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Alpha refers to excess returns earned on an investment above the benchmark return when adjusted for risk. Active portfolio managers seek to generate alpha in diversified portfolios, with diversification intended to eliminate unsystematic risk. Because alpha represents the performance of a portfolio relative to a benchmark, it is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund’s return. Jensen’s alpha takes into consideration the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and includes a risk-adjusted component in its calculation. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Sydney Saporito / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Alpha    
  Alpha is one of five popular technical investment  risk ratios . The others are beta,  standard deviation ,  R-squared , and the  Sharpe ratio . These are all statistical measurements used in  modern portfolio theory (MPT) . All of these indicators are intended to help investors determine the risk-return profile of an investment.

  Active portfolio managers seek to generate alpha in diversified portfolios, with  diversification  intended to eliminate  unsystematic risk . Because alpha represents the performance of a  portfolio  relative to a benchmark, it is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund’s return.
 
 
  In other words, alpha is the return on an investment that is not a result of a general movement in the greater market. As such, an alpha of zero would indicate that the portfolio or fund is tracking perfectly with the benchmark index and that the manager has not added or lost any additional value compared to the broad market.
 
 
    Applying Alpha to Investing    
  The concept of alpha became more popular with the advent of  smart beta  index funds tied to indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. These funds attempt to enhance the performance of a portfolio that tracks a targeted subset of the market.
 
 
  Despite the considerable desirability of alpha in a portfolio, many index benchmarks manage to beat asset managers the vast majority of the time. Due in part to a growing lack of faith in traditional financial advising brought about by this trend, more and more investors are switching to low-cost,  passive  online advisors (often called  robo-advisors ​) who exclusively or almost exclusively invest clients’ capital into index-tracking funds, the rationale being that if they  cannot beat the market , they may as well join it.
 
 
  Moreover, because most traditional financial advisors charge a fee, when one manages a portfolio and nets an alpha of zero, it actually represents a slight  net loss  for the investor. For example, suppose that Jim, a financial advisor, charges 1% of a portfolio’s value for his services and that during a 12-month period, Jim managed to produce an alpha of 0.75 for the portfolio of one of his clients, Frank.
 
 
  While Jim has indeed helped the performance of Frank’s portfolio, the fee that Jim charges is in excess of the alpha he has generated, so Frank’s portfolio has experienced a net loss. For investors, the example highlights the importance of considering fees in conjunction with performance returns and alpha.

"RFP: What a Request for Proposal Is, Requirements, and a Sample","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A request for proposal (RFP) is a document by a government, business, or organization that announces a new project and invites contractors or vendors to submit their bids. 
    What Is a Request for Proposal (RFP)?    
  A request for proposal (RFP) is a document used by companies to announce a project. The proposal generally describes the project and invites qualified contractors to bid on it. Most organizations prefer to launch their projects using RFPs, and many governments always use them.
 
 
  When using an RFP, the entity requesting the bids is responsible for evaluating the feasibility of the bids submitted, the  financial health  of the bidding companies, and each  bidder 's ability to undertake the project.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The RFP defines the project for the company that issues it as well as the companies that respond to it. The RFP describes the project, its goals, and the organization that is sponsoring it and outlines the bidding process and contract terms. RFPs are used by most government agencies and many private companies and organizations. The alternative is a less formal process that may fail to identify the best vendor and the best plan for accomplishing a project. 
 
    Understanding a Request for Proposal (RFP)    
  RFPs are used for complex projects, often requiring many  subcontractors . They describe the organization issuing the RFP, the scope of the project being undertaken, and the criteria for evaluating entries. They also outline the bidding process and the contract terms.
 
 
  The requests include a statement of work describing the tasks to be performed by the winning bidder and the timeline for finishing the job.
 
 
  RFPs also advise bidders on how to prepare proposals, with specific guidance on how the bids should be formatted and presented. They generally include instructions regarding the necessary information and the desired format.
 
 
   Important 
 The proposal should neither be so detailed that it hinders the contractor's creativity nor so vague that it leaves the contractor stumped. 
 
 
 
  Most RFPs are issued by  government agencies  and other organizations in the public sector. They are generally required to open up competition among private companies and remove bias from the process. The agencies want to ensure that they get the lowest and most competitive bid.
 
 
 
 
  However, any private or public organization may issue an RFP to solicit multiple bids and gather a variety of perspectives on the project.
 
 
  For example, a business that wants to change its reporting process from a paper-based system to a computer-based system may put in an RFP for  hardware , software, and a user training program to establish and integrate the new system into the business. A competitive bidding process may give them greater insight into the alternatives that are available.
 
 
    Requirements for an RFP     
   Government agencies  or other entities may be required to issue requests for proposals to provide full and open competition and to drive down the cost of a solution. Accepting a proposal that is most responsive to specifications may not always mean the lowest-priced bid.
 
 
  Skillfully crafting a request for proposal can significantly impact the success or failure of the resulting solution. If the specified requirements are too vague, the bidder may not design and implement an adequate solution for the problem. If the requirements are too detailed and restrictive, the bidders’ innovation may be limited.
 
 
  The RFP process begins with drafting a request for proposal. Bidders review the solicitation and submit suggestions for improvement. After implementing  feedback , the final request for proposal is issued. Bidders then submit their proposals.
 
 
  The customer narrows the selection down to a small group of bidders and enters negotiations on pricing and technical details. The customer may ask the remaining bidders to submit a best and final offer before awarding a contract. The contract is then presented to the company that provides the best and cost-effective solution to the issue.
 
 
    Benefits of an RFP    
  An RFP is, in part, an advertisement. It announces that a project is proceeding, and opens the door to qualified candidates who can get the job done.
 
 
  In government, the RFP has been adopted as a way to ensure that cronyism is removed as a factor in the rewarding of contracts. It also opens up the process to competition, which can be expected to keep project costs lower.
 
 
  The alternative to an RFP is a less formal process requiring a  project manager  to research and identify potential vendors for a project. Depending on how exhaustive the search is, the potential responses can be limited. New vendors and innovative answers may be less likely to be uncovered. 1

Net Present Value (NPV): What It Means and Steps to Calculate It,"What Is Net Present Value (NPV)?    
  Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in  capital budgeting  and investment planning to analyze a project's projected profitability.
 
 
  NPV is the result of calculations that find the  current value of a future stream of payments  using the proper discount rate. In general, projects with a positive NPV are worth undertaking, while those with a negative NPV are not. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Net present value (NPV) is used to calculate the current value of a future stream of payments from a company, project, or investment. To calculate NPV, you need to estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows and pick a discount rate equal to the minimum acceptable rate of return. The discount rate may reflect your cost of capital or the returns available on alternative investments of comparable risk. If the NPV of a project or investment is positive, it means its rate of return will be above the discount rate. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Net Present Value (NPV) Formula    
  If there’s one cash flow from a project that will be paid one year from now, then the calculation for the NPV of the project is as follows: 
 
 N P V = Cash flow ( 1 + i ) t − initial investment where: i = Required return or discount rate t = Number of time periods \begin{aligned} &NPV = \frac{\text{Cash flow}}{(1 + i)^t} - \text{initial investment} \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &i=\text{Required return or discount rate}\\ &t=\text{Number of time periods}\\ \end{aligned} ​ N P V = ( 1 + i ) t Cash flow ​ − initial investment where: i = Required return or discount rate t = Number of time periods ​ 
 
 If analyzing a longer-term project with multiple cash flows, then the formula for the NPV of the project is as follows: 
 
 N P V = ∑ t = 0 n R t ( 1 + i ) t where: R t = net cash inflow-outflows during a single period  t i = discount rate or return that could be earned in alternative investments t = number of time periods \begin{aligned} &NPV = \sum_{t = 0}^n \frac{R_t}{(1 + i)^t}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &R_t=\text{net cash inflow-outflows during a single period }t\\ &i=\text{discount rate or return that could be earned in alternative investments}\\ &t=\text{number of time periods}\\ \end{aligned} ​ N P V = t = 0 ∑ n ​ ( 1 + i ) t R t ​ ​ where: R t ​ = net cash inflow-outflows during a single period  t i = discount rate or return that could be earned in alternative investments t = number of time periods ​ 
 
 
 
 If you are unfamiliar with summation notation, here is an easier way to remember the concept of NPV: 1 
 N P V = Today’s value of the expected cash flows − Today’s value of invested cash \begin{aligned}NPV=\text{Today's value of the expected cash flows}-\text{Today's value of invested cash}\end{aligned} N P V = Today’s value of the expected cash flows − Today’s value of invested cash ​

    What NPV Can Tell You    
  NPV accounts for the  time value of money  and can be used to compare the rates of return of different projects or to compare a projected rate of return with the  hurdle rate  required to approve an investment. 2 
 
 
  The time value of money is represented in the NPV formula by the discount rate, which might be a hurdle rate for a project based on a company’s cost of capital, such as the  weighted average cost of capital (WACC) . No matter how the discount rate is determined, a negative NPV shows that the expected rate of return will fall short of it, meaning that the project will not create value. 1 3 
 
 
  In the context of evaluating corporate securities, the net present value calculation is often called  discounted cash flow (DCF)  analysis. It’s the method used by Warren Buffett to compare the NPV of a company’s future DCFs with its current price. 4 
 
 
  The discount rate is central to the formula. It accounts for the fact that, as long as interest rates are positive, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. Inflation erodes the value of money over time.
 
 
  Meanwhile, today’s dollar can be invested in a safe asset like government bonds; investments riskier than Treasuries must offer a higher rate of return. However it’s determined, the discount rate is simply the baseline rate of  return that a project must exceed  to be worthwhile.
 
 
  For example, an investor could receive $100 today or a year from now. Most investors would not be willing to postpone receiving $100 today. However, what if an investor could choose to receive $100 today or $105 in one year? The 5% rate of return might be worthwhile",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
Zero-One Integer Programming Meaning and Examples,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Zero-One Integer Programming?    
  Zero-one integer programming (which can also be written as '0-1' integer programming) is a mathematical method of using a series of binary functions; in particular, yes ('1') and no ('0') answers to arrive at a solution when there are two  mutually exclusive  options.
 
 
  In the world of finance, zero-one integer programming is often used to provide answers to  capital rationing problems , as well as to optimize investment returns and assist in planning, production, transportation, and other issues.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Zero-one integer programming relies on mutually exclusive yes (1) and no (0) decisions to find solutions to logic problems. In zero-one integer problems, each variable is represented only by 0 ('no') or 1 ('yes'), and could represent selecting or rejecting an option, turning on or off electronic switches, or a straight-forward yes or no answer used in various other applications. This type of programming can be useful for companies making decisions on issues like what to invest in or which of two proposed products are easiest to manufacture. 
 
    Understanding Zero-One Integer Programming    
  Integer programming is a branch of mathematical programming or optimization, which involves creating equations in order to solve problems. The term ""mathematical programming"" is connected with the fact that the goal of solving various problems is choosing programs of action. Assigning a simple yes/no value can be a powerful way to establish a linear problem-solving framework to identify inefficiencies.
 
 
  Fundamentally, the most basic instructions executed by a computer are binary codes, consisting only of ones and zeros. Those codes are directly translated into the “on” and “off” states of the electricity moving through the computer’s physical circuits. In essence, these simple codes form the basis of “machine language”, the most fundamental variety of programming languages. These on and off positions can also be construed as assigning a ""yes"" or ""no"" to a logical function.
 
 
  Of course, no human would be able to construct modern software programs by explicitly programming ones and zeros. Instead, human programmers must rely on various layers of abstraction that can allow them to articulate their commands in a format that is more intuitive to humans. Specifically, modern programmers issue commands in so-called “high-level languages”, which utilize intuitive syntax such as whole English words and sentences, as well as logical operators such as “And”, “Or”, and “Else” that are familiar to everyday usage.
 
 
 
 
  Ultimately, however, these high-level commands need to be translated into machine language. Rather than doing so manually, programmers rely on  assembly languages  whose purpose is to automatically translate between these high-level and low-level languages.
 
 
    Real-World Example of Zero-One Integer Programming    
  A simple example of how zero-one integer  programming  might be used in capital rationing would be in determining the number of product development projects that can be completed by a company by a certain date or within a certain budget. For example, a number of variables for each project can be given values that ultimately result in a 1 (yes) or 0 (no) binary decision about whether or not to include the project in a budget. This can be helpful to companies that are unsure about a specific business decision and are looking for a straightforward way to assess the possibilities.

"What Is Asset-Based Lending? How Loans Work, Example and Types","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Asset-Based Lending?    
  Asset-based lending is the business of loaning money in an agreement that is secured by collateral. An  asset-based loan  or line of credit may be secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, or other property owned by the borrower.
 
 
  The asset-based lending industry serves business, not consumers. It is also known as asset-based financing.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Asset-based lending involves loaning money using the borrower's assets as collateral. Liquid collateral is preferred as opposed to illiquid or physical assets such as equipment. Asset-based lending is often used by small to mid-sized businesses in order to cover short-term cash flow demands. 
 
    How Asset-Based Lending Works    
  Many businesses need to take out loans or obtain lines of credit to meet routine  cash flow  demands. For example, a business might obtain a line of credit to make sure it can cover its payroll expenses even if there's a brief delay in payments it expects to receive.
 
 
  If the company seeking the loan cannot show enough cash flow or cash assets to cover a loan, the lender may offer to approve the loan with its  physical assets as collateral . For example, a new restaurant might be able to obtain a loan only by using its equipment as collateral. Lenders might require a  negative pledge clause or covenant  as part of the loan. This clause will limit the borrower from reusing the pledged asset for another loan.
 
 
  The terms and conditions of an asset-based loan depend on the type and  value of the assets offered  as security. Lenders prefer highly liquid collateral, such as securities, that can readily be converted to cash if the borrower defaults on the payments. Loans using physical assets are considered riskier, so the maximum loan will be considerably less than the book value of the assets. Interest rates charged vary widely, depending on the applicant's credit history, cash flow, and length of time doing business.
 
 
   Important 
 Interest rates on  asset-based lending  are lower than rates on unsecured loans since the lender can recoup most or all of its losses in the event that the borrower defaults. 
 
 
 
    Example    
  For example, say a company seeks a $200,000 loan to expand its operations. If the company pledges the highly liquid  marketable securities  on its balance sheet as collateral, the lender may grant a loan equalling 85% of the face value of the securities. If the firm’s securities are valued at $200,000, the lender will be willing to loan $170,000. If the company chooses to pledge less liquid assets, such as real estate or equipment, it may only be offered 50% of its required financing, or $100,000.
 
 
 
 
  In both cases, the discount represents the costs of converting the collateral to cash and its potential loss in  market value .
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Small and mid-sized companies that are stable and that have physical assets of value are the most common asset-based borrowers.
 
 
  However, even large corporations may occasionally seek asset-based loans to cover short-term needs. The cost and long lead time of issuing additional shares or bonds in the  capital markets  may be too high. The cash demand may be extremely time-sensitive, such as in the case of a major acquisition or an unexpected equipment purchase.

"Joint-Stock Company: What It Is, History, and Examples","Definition 
 A joint stock company is a business in which each investor owns a stake based on the amount they invested. 
    What Is a Joint-Stock Company?    
  A joint-stock company is a business structure where investors own shares proportional to their investment and share in the profits. It was an early form of business organization used to fund large ventures before modern corporations existed. Today, U.S. companies are not officially registered as joint-stock companies, but instead operate as corporations, partnerships, or LLCs.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Joint-stock companies are the ancestors of the modern-day corporation, although there are legal differences. A joint-stock company is a business owned by its shareholders who can buy and sell shares freely. Historically, the shareholders of a joint-stock company could bear unlimited liability for debts owed by the company. In the U.S., incorporation limits shareholder liability to the face value of their shares. 1 An example of a joint-stock company was the English East India Company. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Some examples of well-known joint-stock companies are Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. 
 Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    Characteristics of a Joint-Stock Company    
  Shareholders of a joint-stock company had unlimited liability for company debts. In the U.S., the legal process of registering as a corporation or limited liability company reduces liability to the face value of stock owned by the shareholder or the contribution of the LLC member. 1  In Great Britain, the term ""limited"" has a similar meaning. 2 
 
 
  The shares of a joint-stock company are transferable. If the joint-stock company is public, its shares are traded on registered stock exchanges. Shares of a private joint-stock company are transferable between parties, but the transfer process can be limited by agreement (for example, to family members). 1 
 
 
  Historically, due to the nature of joint-stock company  unlimited liability , a shareholder's personal property could be seized to pay off debts in the event of a company collapse. 3 
 
 
 
 
    Types of Joint-Stock Companies    
    Registered Company    
  A company registers with state and local authorities to be legally allowed to conduct business in the organizational form it selects (e.g., corporation, S-corporation, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, etc.).
 
 
    Chartered Company    
  This is a company that is incorporated under a nation's royal charter. Chartered companies may have certain privileges that relate to conducting their business operations.
 
 
    Statutory Company    
  A statutory company is one that is established by an act of a nation's legislature to provide public services that benefit the populace. The company's responsibilities and privileges are detailed by the act.
 
 
    Benefits of a Joint-Stock Company    
 
 A joint-stock company can access large amounts of money via numerous shareholders that can be used to build a business.  
 Shareholders have a direct say in decisions relating to the management of the company. They also have the right to elect the board of directors. 
 Shares of public companies can be bought and sold freely on stock exchanges. Shares of private companies may be traded as allowed or restricted by the company. 
 Today's joint-stock companies provide shareholders  limited liability  for debts that a company incurs. 
 New shares and  debentures  can be issued if the company requires additional capital. 
 For public companies, there is no ceiling that limits the number of shareholders (a private company may set such limits). 
 Investment risk is diversified among many shareholders, not borne by one or two individuals. 
 Public joint-stock companies support good corporate governance and make their externally audited financial statements available for public scrutiny. 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The Muscovy Company was a joint-stock company chartered by England's Queen Mary in 1555. Shareholders included explorer Sebastian Cabot and numerous London merchants. The company was granted an exclusive right to trade with Russia. 
 
 
 
    Joint-Stock Company vs. Public Company    
  While a joint-stock company is not a specific, legal form of a business entity in the U.S., the term could be used to describe a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or public company—in fact, any company with more than one shareholder.
 
 
  The joint-stock company has a historical association with unlimited liability and the potential for the seizure of personal assets to satisfy outstanding debt. A modern-day public company with shareholders is still a joint-stock company but its legal status limits shareholder liability to ownership/contribution amounts.
 
 
    A Short History of Joint-Stock Companies    
  There are records of joint-stock companies being formed in Europe as early as the 13th century.

    What Is a 12B-1 Fee?    
  A 12b-1 fee is an annual marketing or distribution fee on a mutual fund. The 12b-1 fee is considered to be an operational expense and, as such, is included in a fund's  expense ratio . It is generally between 0.25% and 0.75% (the maximum allowed) of a fund's net assets. The fee gets its name from a section of the  Investment Company Act of 1940 .
 
 
    Understanding 12B-1 Fees    
  Back in the early days of the  mutual fund  business, the 12b-1 fee was thought to help investors. It was believed that by marketing a mutual fund, its assets would increase and management could lower expenses because of  economies of scale . This has yet to be proven. With mutual fund assets passing the $10 trillion mark and growing steadily, critics of this fee are seriously questioning the justification for using it. Today, the 12b-1 fee is mainly used to reward intermediaries for selling a fund's shares. As a commission paid to salespersons, it is currently believed to do nothing to  enhance the performance of a fund .
 
 
  In 2015, the  Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) began examining the use of 12b-1 fees to determine if the rules for charging these fees are being adhered to and the presence of such fees is being properly disclosed.
 
 
    12b-1 Fee Broken Down    
  The 12b-1 fee can be broken down into two distinct charges: the distribution and marketing fee and the service fee. Total 12b-1 fees charged by a fund are limited to 1% annually. The distribution and marketing piece of the fee is capped at 0.75% annually, while the service fee portion of the fee can be up to 0.25%.
 
 
    Use of 12b-1 in Broker-Sold Shares    
   Class B  and  class C  shares of broker-sold funds typically have 12b-1 fees, but they may also be charged on  no-load mutual fund  shares and class A broker-sold shares.
 
 
   Class A shares , which usually charge a  front-end load  but no  back-end load , may come with a reduced 12b-1 expense but normally don't come with the maximum 1% fee. Class B shares, which typically carry no front-end but charge a back-end load that decreases as time passes, often come with a 12b-1 fee. Class C shares usually have the greatest likelihood of carrying the maximum 1% 12b-1 fee. The presence of a 12b-1 fee frequently pushes the overall expense ratio on a fund to above 2%.
 
 
  The Calamos Growth Fund is an example of a fund that carries a smaller 0.25% 12b-1 fee on its class A shares and charges the maximum 1% 12b-1 fee on its class C shares.
 
 
 
 
    What 12b-1 Fees Are Used For    
  The distribution fee covers marketing and paying  brokers  who sell shares. They also go toward advertising the fund and mailing fund literature and  prospectuses  to clients. Shareholder service fees, another form, specifically pay for the fund to hire people to answer investor inquiries and distribute information when necessary, though these fees may be required without the adoption of a 12b-1 plan. Another category of fees that can be charged is known as ""other expenses."" Other expenses can include costs associated with legal, accounting, and administrative services. They may also pay for transfer agent and custodial fees.

    What Is Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)?    
  Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) is a company's cash flow before accounting for interest payments. UFCF shows how much cash is available to the firm before taking financial obligations into account. It is reported on a company's financial statements or may be calculated using financial statements by analysts. UFCF is the opposite of  levered free cash flow (LFCF) , which is the money left over after all a firm's bills are paid.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Unlevered free cash flow is the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations. It is of interest to investors because it indicates how much cash a business has to expand. UFCF can be contrasted with levered free cash flow which does take into account financial obligations. UFCF is preferred when undertaking discounted cash flow analysis. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    Formula for Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)    
  The formula for UFCF uses  earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) , and capital expenditures (CAPEX): 
 
 UFCF = EBITDA − CAPEX − Working Capital − Taxes where: UFCF = Unlevered free cash flow \begin{aligned} &\text{UFCF} = \textit{EBITDA} - \textit{CAPEX} - \text{Working Capital} - \text{Taxes} \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{UFCF} = \text{Unlevered free cash flow} \\ \end{aligned} ​ UFCF = EBITDA − CAPEX − Working Capital − Taxes where: UFCF = Unlevered free cash flow ​ 
 
 Capital expenditures  represent the investments in buildings, machines, and equipment. It also uses working capital, which includes inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.
 
 
   Tip 
 Although UFCF isn't explicitly noted on a company's financial statements, you can find the information you need to calculate it on its  income statement  and balance sheet. 
 
 
 
    Understanding Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)    
  Unlevered free cash flow is the gross free cash flow generated by a company. Unlevered free cash flow is the free cash flow available to pay all stakeholders in a firm, including debt holders as well as equity holders.
 
 
 
 
  Leverage is another name for debt. Cash flows that are levered already account for interest and other financial obligations.   Instead of interest, unlevered free cash flow is net of CapEx and  working capital  needs—the cash needed to maintain and grow the company's asset base to generate revenue and earnings. Non-cash expenses, such as  depreciation  and  amortization , are added back to earnings to arrive at the firm's unlevered free cash flow.

  A company with a sizeable outstanding debt (high leverage) is more likely to report unlevered free cash flow because it provides a rosier picture of the company's financial health.
 
 
  The figure shows how assets are performing in a vacuum because it ignores the payments made for debt incurred to obtain those assets. Investors have to make sure to consider debt obligations since highly leveraged companies are at greater risk for bankruptcy.
 
 
   Important 
 Interest expense often appears with differences in timing between interest accrued and interest paid. 
 
 
 
    Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF) vs Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF)    
  The difference between unlevered and levered free cash flow is the inclusion of financing expenses. Levered free cash flow is the amount of cash a business has after it has met all of its financial obligations, such as interest,  loan  payments, and other financing expenses.

What Is a 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A 403(b) plan, also known as a Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA) plan, is a retirement savings account offered to employees of schools, the public sector, and non-profits. 
    What Is a 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan?    
  A 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plan (TSA) is a retirement savings plan for employees of public schools, government agencies, and certain other tax-exempt non-profit organizations.
 
 
  Employees who are eligible to use a 403(b) include teachers, school administrators, professors, government employees, nurses, doctors, and librarians.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan (TSA) was designed for employees of tax-exempt organizations. As with a 401(k), contributions to a 403(b) are made through payroll deductions and come with tax benefits for the saver. Investment choices can be more limited in a 403(b) and some accounts offer less protection from creditors than 401(k)s. 
 
    403(b) Contributions    
  The 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan operates like a  401(k)  plan, allowing participants to save money for retirement through  payroll deductions  while enjoying certain tax benefits. Similarities include:
 
 
 
 Contributions through payroll deductions 
 Annual contribution limits set by the  Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) 
 An option for the employer to match part of the employee's contribution 
 Participants must reach 59½ before withdrawing funds or face an  early withdrawal  penalty  1 
 
 
  Those who are eligible to contribute to a 403(b) include:

   Employees of public schools, state colleges, and universities Public school employees of Indian tribal governments Ministers, members of the clergy, and church employees Employees of other tax-exempt organizations  2 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 If an employer offers a 403(b) and a 401(k), individuals can contribute to both, but their combined contribution cannot exceed the annual IRS limit of $23,500 in 2025 (up from $23,000 in 2024.) People aged 50 and over can contribute an additional $7,500 as a  catch-up contribution , although some 403(b) plans base eligibility for the catch-up on length of service rather than age. 3 4 
 
 
 
    Types of 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans    
  Like the 401(k), the 403(b) plan can give the employee a choice of a traditional plan or a Roth plan. Not all employers offer a Roth option.
 
 
  With a traditional 403(b) plan, the employee has pretax money automatically deducted from each paycheck and paid into a personal retirement account. Thus, the employee's income and the taxes owed on it are reduced for the year. The taxes will be due only when the employee makes a withdrawal. 2 
 
 
  With a Roth 403(b) plan,  after-tax money  is paid into the retirement account. There's no immediate tax advantage. But, the employee will not owe any more taxes on that money or the profit it accrues when it is withdrawn. 5 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Clergy can participate in a 403(b) but another plan, the 403(b)(9), is designed specifically for employees of religious institutions. 
 
 
 
    Advantages of 403(b) Plans    
  The big advantages of a 403(b) are the same as those for a 401(k): The money contributed and the earnings that accrue in a traditional account are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn. Both the contributions and the earnings in a Roth 403(b) are free from further taxes. 2 
 
 
  Many 403(b) plans vest funds over a shorter period than 401(k)s, and some even allow immediate  vesting  of funds, which is rare for 401(k)s.
 
 
  An employee with 15 or more years of service with certain nonprofits or government agencies may be able to make additional catch-up contributions to a 403(b) plan. The usual eligibility for the catchup starts at age 50. 6 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 According to a 2024 survey by AARP of age 50-plus adults who are regularly saving for retirement, just 33% expect to accumulate enough money in retirement to be financially secure if they continue saving at their current rate. 7 
 
 
 
    Disadvantages of 403(b) Plans    
  People who withdraw money from a 403(b) plan before age 59½ owe income taxes on the money in the year it is withdrawn, plus a 10% tax penalty. (The same rule applies to a 401(k) plan.)
 
 
  The penalty can be avoided under certain circumstances, such as separating from an employer at age 55 or older, needing to pay a qualified medical expense, or becoming disabled. The taxes owed cannot be avoided. 1 
 
 
  When the 403(b) was invented in 1958, it was known as a  tax-sheltered annuity . 8  True to its history, the modern 403(b) offers the  variable annuity  contract as an option.

Triangle Chart Pattern in Technical Analysis Explained,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Triangle Chart Pattern?    
  A triangle chart pattern is a tool used in technical analysis. Named for its resemblance to a series of triangles, the triangle chart pattern is created by drawing  trendlines  along a converging price range. The result signals a pause in the prevailing trend.
 
 
  Technical analysts read the triangle as an indicator of a continuation of an existing trend or reversal.
 
 
  Despite being a continuation, traders should look for breakouts before they make a move to buy or sell.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 In technical analysis, a triangle is a continuation pattern on a chart that forms a triangle-like shape. Triangles are similar to wedges and pennants and can be either a continuation pattern, if validated, or a powerful reversal pattern, in the event of its failure. Three potential triangle variations can develop as price action carves out a holding pattern: ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. 
 
    Understanding Triangle Chart Patterns    
   Technical analysis  in general is a trading strategy that involves creating charts and patterns that help traders identify trends in the price movements of a single stock, a sector, or the markets as a whole. They track price patterns over time to make predictions about future price performance.
 
 
  Triangle patterns are aptly named because the upper and lower trendlines ultimately meet at the apex on the right side, forming a corner. These patterns are formed once the trading range of a stock or another security becomes narrow.
 
 
  Connecting the start of the upper trendline to the beginning of the lower trendline completes the other two corners to create the triangle. The upper trendline is formed by connecting the highs, while the lower trendline is formed by connecting the lows.
 
 
  Triangles are similar to  wedges  (price patterns marked by converging trendlines) and  pennants  (continuation patterns that are formed when an asset shows a large movement), which are also used in technical analysis.
 
 
 
 
  They can be either a continuation pattern, if validated, or a powerful  reversal  pattern, in the event of failure. Traders use triangles to pinpoint when the narrowing of a stock or security's trading range after a downtrend or uptrend occurs.
 
 
  Three potential triangle variations can develop as price action carves out a holding pattern, namely ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. Technicians see a  breakout , or a failure, of a triangular pattern, especially on heavy volume, as being potent  bullish  or  bearish  signals of a resumption, or reversal, of the prior trend. 
 
 
   Warning 
 Technical tools are used to make predictions about future trends based on past performance. But remember that the market can be very unpredictable and can swing in any direction at any time. 
 
 
 
    Types of Triangle Chart Patterns    
  The following diagram shows the three basic types of triangle chart patterns: the ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. We go into more detail about what they are and how they work below.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 
 
    Ascending Triangle    
  An  ascending triangle  is a breakout pattern that forms when the price breaches the upper horizontal trendline with rising volume. It is a bullish formation.
 
 
  The upper trendline must be horizontal, indicating nearly identical highs, which form a resistance level. The lower trendline is rising diagonally, indicating higher lows as buyers patiently step up their bids.
 
 
  Buyers eventually lose patience and rush into the security above the resistance price, which triggers more buying as the  uptrend  resumes. The upper trendline, which was formerly a resistance level, now becomes support.
 
 
    Descending Triangle    
  A  descending triangle  is an inverted version of the ascending triangle and is considered a breakdown pattern. The lower trendline should be horizontal, connecting near identical lows. The upper trendline declines diagonally toward the apex.
 
 
  The  breakdown  occurs when the price collapses through the lower horizontal trendline support as a downtrend resumes. The lower trendline, which was support, now becomes resistance.
 
 
    Symmetrical Triangle    
  A  symmetrical triangle  is composed of a diagonal falling upper trendline and a diagonally rising lower trendline. As the price moves toward the apex, it will inevitably breach the upper trendline for a breakout and uptrend on rising prices or breach the lower trendline forming a breakdown and downtrend with falling prices.
 
 
  Traders should watch for a volume spike and at least two closes beyond the trendline to confirm the break is valid and not a  head fake . Symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, which means they tend to break in the direction of the initial move before the triangle forms. So if an uptrend precedes a symmetrical triangle, a trader","By

"Unilateral Contract: Definition, How It Works, and Types","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Unilateral Contract?    
  A unilateral contract is a one-sided contract agreement in which an offeror promises to pay only after the completion of a task by the offeree. In this type of agreement, the offeror is the only party with a contractual obligation. A unilateral contract differs from a  bilateral contract  in which both parties are bound by the agreement.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Unilateral contracts are one-sided, requiring only a commitment from the offeror. Unilateral contracts do not require the offeree to perform the requested task or act. Unilateral contracts are usually used to make optional offers. Bilateral contracts require an agreement between two parties and obligation on both sides. 
 
    Understanding Unilateral Contracts    
  Unilateral contracts occur when the offeror makes an offer to another party. This type of contract requires the offeree to perform an act that the offeror requests. The offeree has no obligation to complete the task and the offeror will only pay if the request is completed.
 
 
  Unilateral contracts are considered enforceable by  contract law , however, legal action is not commonly pursued unless the offeree claims to be eligible for remuneration tied to the request.
 
 
   Contract breach  depends on whether or not the terms of the contract were clear and if it can be proven that the offeree is eligible for payment of specified acts based on the unilateral contract’s provisions.
 
 
    Types of Unilateral Contracts    
  Unilateral contracts are primarily one-sided without obligation from the offeree. Open requests and insurance policies are two of the most common types of unilateral contracts.
 
 
    Open Requests    
  Offerors may use unilateral contracts to make a broad or optional request and payment is made only when certain specifications are met. If an offeree completes the task, the offeror is required to pay.
 
 
 
 
  Rewards are a common type of unilateral contract request where information received may lead to a criminal's conviction that will warrant a payment. Funds can be paid to a single individual or several individuals offering information that serves this specific purpose.
 
 
  A unilateral contract is commonly used with a  request for labor . An individual may offer to pay someone to clean their house or walk their dog and the offeree is paid only when the task is completed.
 
 
    Insurance    
   Insurance  policies have unilateral contract characteristics since the insurer promises to pay if certain acts occur under the terms of a contract’s coverage. In an insurance contract, the offeree pays a premium specified by the insurer to maintain the plan and receive coverage if a specific event occurs.
 
 
    The 4 Elements of a Unilateral Contract    
  To make a unilateral contract legally binding, four elements must exist: 
 
 
    Agreement    
  One party makes an offer to another party and both must accept the offer, without coercion or force from either side. 
 
 
    Consideration    
  Consideration is the price paid for the promise or agreement and it does not need to be a monetary payment. Consideration can be any type of property or holding that both parties agree to warrant acceptable payment. 
 
 
    Intention    
  Both parties must have the full intention to create a binding contract and understand the terms and conditions of the agreement. 
 
 
    Certainty    
  Both parties must fully understand what must happen to complete the terms of the contract. In a unilateral contract, an action or task will need to be completed for the contract to be fulfilled. 
 
 
    Unilateral Contracts vs. Bilateral Contracts    
  Contracts can be unilateral or bilateral. In a unilateral contract, only the offeror has an obligation. The offeree is not required to complete the task or action.
 
 
  In a bilateral contract, both parties agree to an obligation and involve equal obligation from the offeror and the offeree. In general, the primary distinction between unilateral and bilateral contracts is the amount of reciprocal obligation from both parties.
 
 
   How Do You Know If a Contract Is Unilateral? 
 A unilateral contract does not obligate the offeree to accept the offeror's request and there is no requirement to complete the task. A bilateral contract, however, contains firm agreements and promises between two parties. 
 
 
   Can You Break a Unilateral Contract? 
 In a unilateral contract, the offeror may revoke the offer before the offeree's performance begins and this change should be expressed to the offeree before any task is started. 
 
 
   Are Unilateral Contract Mistakes Enforceable? 
 If a mistake occurs during a unilateral contract, some remedies for a mistake include contract reform where the contract is changed or a new contract is started, or full contract cancellation. 
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  In a unilateral contract, the offeror is the only party with a contractual obligation. The","By

"Understanding Money: Its Properties, Types, and Uses","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Money is a system of value that facilitates the exchange of goods and services in an economy, serving as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. 
    What Is Money?    
  Money is a system of value that facilitates the exchange of goods in an economy. Using money allows buyers and sellers to pay less in transaction costs, compared to  barter trading .
 
 
  The first types of money were  commodities . Their physical properties made them desirable as a medium of exchange. In contemporary markets, money can include government-issued  legal tender  or  fiat money , money substitutes, fiduciary media, or electronic  cryptocurrencies .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Money is a system of value that facilitates the exchange of goods. The use of money eliminates the problem of bartering where both parties must have something the other wants or needs. Historically, the first forms of money were agricultural commodities, such as grain or livestock. Today, most money systems are based on standardized currencies that are controlled by central banks. Digital cryptocurrencies also have some of the specific properties of money. 
 
    How Money Works    
  Money is a  liquid asset  used to facilitate transactions of value. It is used as a  medium of exchange  between individuals and entities. It's also a  store of value  and a  unit of account  that can measure the value of other goods.
 
 
  Prior to the invention of money, most economies relied on  bartering , where individuals would trade the goods they had directly for those that they needed. This raised the problem of the double coincidence of wants: a transaction could only take place if both participants had something that the other needed. Money eliminates this problem by acting as an intermediary good.
 
 
  The first known forms of money were agricultural commodities, such as grain or cattle. These goods were in high demand and traders knew that they would be able to use or trade these goods again in the future. Cocoa beans, cowrie shells, and agricultural tools have also served as early forms of money. 1 
 
 
 
 
  As economies became more complex, money was standardized into  currencies . This reduced transaction costs by making it easier to measure and compare value. Also, the representations of money became increasingly abstract, from precious metals and stamped coins to paper notes, and, in the modern era, electronic records.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 During World War II, cigarettes became a de facto currency for soldiers in prisoner-of-war camps. The use of cigarettes as money made tobacco highly desirable, even among soldiers who did not smoke. 2 
 
 
 
    What Are the Properties of Money?    
  In order to be most useful, money should be fungible, durable, portable, recognizable, and stable. These properties reduce the  transaction cost  of using money by making it easy to exchange.
 
 
    Money Should Be Fungible    
  The word fungible refers to a quality that allows one thing to be exchanged, substituted, or returned for another thing, under the assumption of equivalent value. Thus, units of money should be interchangeable with one another.
 
 
  For example, metal coins should have a standard weight and purity. Commodity money should be relatively uniform in quality. Trying to use a non-fungible good as money results in transaction costs that involve individually evaluating each unit of the good before an exchange can take place.
 
 
    Money Should Be Durable    
  Money should be durable enough to retain its usefulness for many, future exchanges. A perishable good or a good that degrades quickly due to various exchanges will be less useful for future transactions. Trying to use a non-durable good as money conflicts with money's essential future-oriented use and value. 
 
 
    Money Should Be Portable    
  Money should be easy to carry and divide so that a worthwhile quantity can be carried on one's person or transported. For example, trying to use a good that's difficult or inconvenient to carry as money could require physical transportation that results in transaction costs.
 
 
    Money Should Be Recognizable    
  The authenticity and quantity of the good should be readily apparent to users so that they can easily agree to the terms of an exchange. Using a non-recognizable good as money can result in transaction costs relating to authenticating the goods and agreeing on the quantity needed for an exchange. 
 
 
    Money's Supply Should Be Stable    
  The supply of the item used as money should be relatively constant over time to prevent fluctuations in value. Using a non-stable good as money produces transaction costs due to the risk that its value might rise or fall, because of scarcity or over-abundance, before the next transaction.
 
 
    How Is Money Used?    
  Money primarily functions as the good people use for exchanges of items of value. However, it also has secondary functions that derive fro","By

 Definition 
 A t-test measures the difference between the means of two samples. 
    What Is a T-Test?    
  A t-test is an inferential  statistical  test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related.
 
 
  T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.
 
 
  The t-test assists in hypothesis testing in statistics and uses the t-statistic, the  t-distribution  values, and the degrees of freedom to determine statistical significance.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A t-test can shed light on a statistically significant difference between the means of two data sets. It is used for hypothesis testing in statistics. Calculating a t-test requires the difference between the mean values from each data set, the standard deviation of each group, and the number of data values. T-tests can be dependent or independent. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang 
 
    Understanding the T-Test    
  A t-test compares the mean values of two samples to determine a statistically significant difference.
 
 
  For example, the grades of students from a physics class and those of a different group of students from a writing class would not likely have the same mean and standard deviation.

  Similarly, samples taken from the placebo-fed control group of a drug test and those taken from the drug-prescribed group should have a slightly different mean and standard deviation.
 
 
  Four assumptions are made while using a t-test:
 
 
 
 
   The data collected must follow a continuous or ordinal scale, such as the scores for an IQ test. The data is collected from a randomly selected portion of the total population The data will result in a normal distribution of a bell-shaped curve. Equal or homogenous variance exists when the standard variations are equal. 
 
 
  Mathematically, the t-test takes a sample from each of the two sets and establishes the problem statement. It assumes a null hypothesis, which means that it assumes the two means are equal. 
 
 
  Using the t-test formulas, values are calculated and compared against the standard values. This comparison  helps to determine the effect of chance  on the difference, and whether the difference is outside that chance range.
 
 
  The t-test questions whether the difference between the groups represents a true difference in the study or merely a random difference.
 
 
  Based on the results, the assumed null hypothesis is accepted or rejected. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it indicates that data readings are strong and are probably not due to chance.
 
 
   Null hypothesis rejected : Differences are statistically significant Null hypothesis accepted : Differences are not statistically significant 
 
 
  The t-test is just one of many tests used for this purpose. Others may be more appropriate depending on the number of variables or the size of the sample.
 
 
  For example, statisticians use a  z-test  for data sets with a large sample size. Other testing options include the chi-square test and the f-test.

    What Is an American Depositary Receipt (ADR)?    
  American depositary receipts (ADRs) are negotiable certificates issued by a U.S. depositary bank representing a specified number of shares—usually one share—of a foreign company's stock. The ADR trades on U.S. stock markets as any domestic shares would.
 
 
  ADRs offer U.S. investors a way to purchase stock in overseas companies that would not otherwise be available. Foreign firms also benefit, as ADRs enable them to attract American investors and capital without the hassle and expense of listing on U.S. stock exchanges.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An American depositary receipt is a certificate issued by a U.S. bank that represents shares in foreign stock. These certificates trade on American stock exchanges. ADRs and their dividends are priced in U.S. dollars. ADRs represent an easy, liquid way for U.S. investors to own foreign stocks. These investments may open investors up to double taxation, and a limited number of options are available. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    How American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) Work    
  American depositary receipts are denominated in U.S. dollars. The  underlying security  is held by a U.S. financial institution, often by an overseas branch. These securities are priced and traded in dollars and cleared through U.S. settlement systems.
 
 
  To begin offering ADRs, a U.S. bank must purchase shares on a foreign exchange. The bank holds the stock as inventory and issues an ADR for domestic trading. ADRs can be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq, and  over-the-counter  (OTC). 1 
 
 
  U.S. banks require that foreign companies provide them with detailed financial information. This requirement makes it easier for American investors to assess a company's financial health.

    Types of American Depositary Receipts    
  American depositary receipts come in two basic categories:
 
 
 
 
    Sponsored ADRs    
  A bank issues a  sponsored  ADR on behalf of the foreign company. The bank and the business enter into a legal arrangement. The foreign company usually pays the costs of issuing an ADR and retains control, while the bank handles the transactions with investors. Sponsored ADRs are categorized by what degree the foreign company complies with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and American accounting procedures. 1 
 
 
    Unsponsored ADRs    
  A bank also issues an  unsponsored  ADR. However, this certificate has no direct involvement, participation, or even permission from the foreign company. Theoretically, several unsponsored ADRs for the same foreign company could be issued by different U.S. banks. These different offerings may also offer varying dividends. With sponsored programs, only one ADR is issued by the bank working with the foreign company.
 
 
  One primary difference between the two types of ADRs is where they trade. All except the lowest level of sponsored ADRs register with the SEC and trade on major U.S. stock exchanges. Unsponsored ADRs will trade only over the counter. Unsponsored ADRs never include voting rights. 1

How to Use a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Make a Deal,"What Is a Letter of Intent (LOI)?    
  A letter of intent (LOI) is a document declaring the preliminary commitment of one party to do business with another. The letter outlines the chief terms of a prospective deal. Commonly used in major business transactions, LOIs are similar in content to  term sheets . However, LOIs are presented in letter formats, while term sheets are structured as lists. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A letter of intent (LOI) is a document declaring the preliminary commitment of one party to do business with another. An LOI outlines the chief terms of a prospective deal and is commonly used in business transactions. LOIs are useful when two parties are initially brought together to determine the broad strokes of a deal before they resolve its finer points. Terms included in an LOI are certain stipulations, requirements, timelines, and the parties involved. Many LOIs include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and no-solicitation provisions. Letters of intent are also used outside of the business world when two parties intend to work together or form a deal. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight 
 
    Understanding a Letter of Intent (LOI)    
  LOIs are useful when two parties are initially brought together to hammer out the broad strokes of a transaction before the finer points are resolved. LOIs often include provisions stating that a deal may only go through if financing has been secured by one or both parties, or that it may be cancelled if papers are not signed by a certain date.
 
 
   Important 
 Since LOIs typically discuss potential points of deals that have yet to be cemented, they are almost universally intended to be  non-binding . 
 
 
 
  LOIs can be iterative in nature. One party may present an LOI, to which the other party may either counter with a tweaked version of that LOI or draft a new document altogether. Ideally, by the time both parties come together to formalize a deal, there will be no surprises on either side of the table.
 
 
  Many LOIs include  non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) , which contractually stipulate the components of a deal both parties agree to keep confidential, and which details may be shared publicly. Many LOIs also feature no-solicitation provisions, which forbid one party from poaching the other party's employees.
 
 
 
 
  A letter of intent is usually drafted and signed while negotiations between parties are ongoing so that the final terms of a deal might vary from what was agreed upon in the LOI.  Due diligence  is conducted by both parties before doing business. It is a prudent business practice to complete due diligence before signing an LOI.

    Purpose of a Letter of Intent (LOI)    
  An LOI may be used by different parties for many purposes. Parties can use an LOI to outline some of the basic, fundamental terms of an agreement before they negotiate and finalize all the details. Furthermore, the LOI may be used to signal that two parties are negotiating a deal, such as a merger or  joint venture (JV) .
 
 
  Overall, LOIs aim to achieve the following:
 
 
 
 Clarify which key points of a deal must be negotiated. 
 Protect all parties involved in the deal. 
 Announce the nature of the deal, such as a joint venture or a  merger  between two companies. 
 
 
    Applications of a Letter of Intent (LOI)    
  In the context of business deals, LOIs are typically drafted by a company's legal team, which outlines the details of the intended action. For example, in the  merger and acquisitions (M&A)  process, LOIs detail whether a firm plans to take over another company with cash or through a stock deal.
 
 
  Letters of intent also have applications beyond the business world. For example, parents may use them to express the expectations they have for their children in the event both parents die. Although they aren't legal documents (like wills), LOIs may be considered by family court judges responsible for legislating what happens to the children under such circumstances.
 
 
  LOIs are also used by those seeking  government grants  and by highly sought-after high school varsity athletes. These individuals frequently draft LOIs to declare their commitments to attend particular colleges or universities.
 
 
   What Is the Purpose of a Letter of Intent to Purchase? 
 A letter of intent to purchase is a document that expresses a buyer's serious interest in purchasing a business. A letter of intent to purchase may also be called a letter of interest. Some of the main points included in a letter of intent to purchase include the purchase price, terms of payment, and the timeline for completing the sale.

Ultimate Guide to Game Theory: Principles and Applications,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Game Theory?    
  Game theory examines how individuals and entities, referred to as players, strategize and make decisions in competitive environments. As a theoretical framework, it models scenarios involving conflicts of interest and provides insights into possible outcomes and strategies. Often described as the science of strategy, game theory helps predict and explain the decisions made by independent and competing actors in strategic settings. Its applications are vast, spanning fields including business, psychology, economics, and politics to address complex scenarios such as pricing strategies, mergers, and negotiations.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Game theory is a method of studying strategic decision-making among rational players, applicable to various fields like economics, business, and psychology. The Nash equilibrium is a key concept in game theory, where no player can benefit by changing strategies unless others do so as well. Game theory categorizes strategic interactions into several types of games, including zero-sum and non-zero-sum, cooperative and non-cooperative, and one-shot versus repeated games. Real-world applications of game theory include pricing strategies in business, resolving project management dilemmas, and understanding consumer behavior. Despite its broad usage, game theory's effectiveness can be limited by its reliance on the assumption of rational behavior, which often overlooks the complexities of human emotions and social factors. 
 
 
 Game Theory 
 
    Understanding the Mechanics of Game Theory     
  The goal of game theory is to explain the strategic actions of two or more players in a given situation with set rules and outcomes. Any time a situation with two or more players involves known payouts or quantifiable consequences, we can use game theory to help determine the most likely outcomes.
 
 
  The focus of game theory is the game, which is an interactive situation that involves rational players. The key to game theory is that one player's payoff is contingent on the strategy implemented by the other player. 
 
 
 
 
  The game identifies the players' identities, preferences, available strategies, and how these strategies affect the outcome. Depending on the model, various other requirements or assumptions may be necessary.

  Game theory has a wide range of applications, including psychology, evolutionary biology, war, politics, economics, and business. Despite its many advances, game theory is still a young and developing science.
 
 
   Important 
 According to game theory, the actions and choices of all the participants affect the outcome of each. It's assumed players within the game are rational and will strive to maximize their payoffs in the game. 1 
 
 
 
    Key Terms in Game Theory Explained    
  Here are a few terms commonly used in the study of game theory:
 
 
 
 Game : Any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two or more decision-makers (players). 
 Players : A strategic decision-maker within the context of the game. 
 Strategy : A complete plan of action a player will take given the set of circumstances that might arise within the game. 
 Payoff :   The payout a player receives from arriving at a particular outcome. The payout can be in any quantifiable form, from dollars to  utility . 
 Information set : The information available at a given point in the game. The term ""information set"" is most usually applied when the game has a sequential component. 
 Equilibrium : The point in a game where both players have made their decisions and an outcome is reached. 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The key pioneers of game theory were mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s. 2  Mathematician John Nash is regarded by many as providing the first significant extension of the von Neumann and Morgenstern work. 3 
 
 
 
    The Nash Equilibrium    
   Nash equilibrium  is an outcome reached that, once achieved, means no player can increase payoff by changing decisions unilaterally. 3  It can also be thought of as a ""no regrets"" outcome in the sense that once a decision is made, the player will have no regrets about it, considering the consequences.
 
 
  The Nash equilibrium is reached over time, normally. However, once the Nash equilibrium is reached, it will not be deviated from. In such a case, consider how a unilateral move would affect the situation. Does it make any sense? It shouldn't, and that's why the Nash equilibrium outcome is described as ""no regrets."" 4 
 
 
  Generally, there can be more than one equilibrium in a game. However, this usually occurs in games with","By

"Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: What It Is, How to Calculate, Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio?    
  The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is an assessment of lending risk that financial institutions and other lenders examine before approving a mortgage. Typically, loan assessments with high LTV ratios are considered higher-risk loans. Therefore, if the mortgage is approved, the loan has a higher interest rate.
 
 
  Additionally, a loan with a high LTV ratio may require the borrower to purchase  mortgage insurance  to offset the risk to the lender. This type of insurance is called private mortgage insurance (PMI).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Loan-to-value (LTV) is an often used ratio in mortgage lending to determine the amount necessary to put in a down payment and whether a lender will extend credit to a borrower. Lower LTVs are better in the eyes of lenders, but require borrowers to come up with larger down payments. Most lenders offer mortgage and home-equity applicants the lowest possible interest rate when the loan-to-value ratio is at or below 80%. Mortgages become more expensive for borrowers with higher LTVs. Fannie Mae's HomeReady and Freddie Mac's Home Possible mortgage programs for low-income borrowers allow an LTV ratio of 97% (3% down payment) but require mortgage insurance (PMI) until the ratio falls to 80%. 
 
    How to Calculate the Loan-to-Value Ratio    
  Interested homebuyers can easily calculate the LTV ratio of a home. This is the formula:
 
 
   L T V r a t i o = M A A P V where: M A = Mortgage Amount A P V = Appraised Property Value \begin{aligned} &LTV ratio=\frac{MA}{APV}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &MA = \text{Mortgage Amount}\\ &APV = \text{Appraised Property Value}\\ \end{aligned} ​ L T V r a t i o = A P V M A ​ where: M A = Mortgage Amount A P V = Appraised Property Value ​ 
 
 
  An LTV ratio is calculated by dividing the amount borrowed by the  appraised  value of the property, expressed as a percentage. For example, if you buy a home appraised at $100,000 for its appraised value, and make a $10,000  down payment , you will borrow $90,000. This results in an LTV ratio of 90% (i.e., 90,000/100,000).
 
 
 
 
    Understanding the Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio    
  Determining an LTV ratio is a critical component of mortgage  underwriting . It may be used in the process of  buying a home ,  refinancing  a current mortgage into a new loan, or borrowing against accumulated  equity  within a property.
 
 
  Lenders assess the LTV ratio to determine the level of exposure to risk they take on when underwriting a mortgage. When borrowers request a loan for an amount that is at or near the appraised value (and therefore has a higher LTV ratio), lenders perceive that there is a greater chance of the loan going into  default . This is because there is very little equity built up within the property.
 
 
  As a result, in the event of a  foreclosure , the lender may find it difficult to sell the home for enough to cover the outstanding mortgage balance and still make a profit from the transaction. 
 
 
   Tip 
 The main factors impacting LTV ratios are the amount of the loan and the value of the property. A higher down payment (which reduces the loan amount) will result in a lower LTV ratio. 
 
 
 
    How LTV Is Used by Lenders    
  A LTV ratio is only one factor in determining eligibility for securing a mortgage, a  home equity loan , or a  line of credit . However, it can play a substantial role in the interest rate that a borrower is able to secure. Most lenders offer mortgage and home-equity applicants the lowest possible interest rate when their LTV ratio is at or below 80%. 1 
 
 
  A higher LTV ratio does not exclude borrowers from being approved for a mortgage, although the interest on the loan may rise as the LTV ratio increases. For example, a borrower with an LTV ratio of 95% may be approved for a mortgage. However, their interest rate may be higher than the interest rate given to a borrower with an LTV ratio of 75%.
 
 
  If the LTV ratio is higher than 80%, a borrower may be required to purchase  private mortgage insurance (PMI) . This can add anywhere from 0.5% to 1% to the total amount of the loan on an annual basis. For example, PMI with a rate of 1% on a $100,000 loan would add an additional $1,000 to the total amount paid per year (or $83.33 per month). PMI payments are required until the LTV ratio is 80% or lower. The LTV ratio will decrease as you pay down your loan and as the value of your home increases over time.
 
 
  In general, the lower the LTV ratio, the greater the chance that the loan will be approved and the lower the interest rate is likely to be. In addition, as a borrower, it's less likely that you will be required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI).
 
 
  While it is not a law that lenders require an 80% LTV ratio in order for borrowers to  avoid the additional cost of PMI , it is the practice of nearly all lenders. Exceptions to this requirement are sometimes made for borrowers who have a high income","By

Entrepreneur: What It Means to Be One and How to Get Started,"What Is an Entrepreneur?    
  An entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. The process of setting up a business is known as  entrepreneurship .
 
 
  Entrepreneurs play a key role in any economy, using the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate needs and  bring new ideas to market . Entrepreneurship that proves to be successful in taking on the risks of creating a  startup  is rewarded with profits and growth opportunities.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A person who undertakes the risk of starting a new business venture is called an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur creates a firm to realize their idea, known as entrepreneurship, which aggregates capital and labor in order to produce goods or services for profit. Entrepreneurship is highly risky but also can be highly rewarding, as it serves to generate economic wealth, growth, and innovation. Ensuring funding is key for entrepreneurs: Financing resources include Small Business Administration loans and crowdfunding. The way entrepreneurs file and pay taxes will depend on how the business is set up in terms of structure. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Yurle Villegas 
 
    Why Are Entrepreneurs Important?    
  Entrepreneurship is one of the resources economists categorize as integral to production, the other three being land/natural resources, labor, and capital. An entrepreneur combines the first three of these to manufacture goods or provide services. They typically create a  business plan , hire labor, acquire resources and financing, and provide leadership and management for the business.
 
 
  Economists have never had a consistent definition of ""entrepreneur"" or ""entrepreneurship"" (the word ""entrepreneur"" comes from the French verb  entreprendre , meaning ""to undertake""). Though the concept of an entrepreneur existed and was known for centuries, the classical and  neoclassical economists  left entrepreneurs out of their formal models. They assumed that perfect information would be known to fully rational actors, leaving no room for risk-taking or discovery. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that economists seriously attempted to incorporate entrepreneurship into their models.
 
 
 
 
  Three thinkers were central to the inclusion of entrepreneurs: Joseph Schumpeter, Frank Knight, and Israel Kirzner. Schumpeter suggested that entrepreneurs—not just companies—were responsible for the creation of new things in the search for profit. Knight focused on entrepreneurs as the bearers of uncertainty and believed they were responsible for risk premiums in  financial markets . Kirzner thought of entrepreneurship as a process that led to the discovery of opportunities. 1 
 
 
  Fast-forward to today, entrepreneurs commonly face many obstacles when building their companies. The three that many of them cite as the most challenging include overcoming bureaucracy, hiring talent, and obtaining financing.
 
 
    What Are Different Types of Entrepreneurs?    
  Not every entrepreneur is the same and not all have the same goals. Here are a few types of entrepreneurs: 
 
 
    Builder    
  Builders seek to create scalable businesses within a short time frame. Builders typically pass $5 million in revenue in the first two to four years and continue to build up until $100 million or beyond. These individuals seek to build out a strong infrastructure by hiring the best talent and seeking the best investors. Sometimes, they have temperamental personalities that are suited to the fast growth they desire but may make personal and business relationships difficult. 2 
 
 
    Opportunist    
  Opportunistic entrepreneurs are optimistic individuals with the ability to pick out financial opportunities, get in at the right time, stay on board during the time of growth, and exit when a business hits its peak.
 
 
  These types of entrepreneurs are concerned with profits and the wealth they will build, so they are attracted to ideas where they can create residual or renewal income. Because they are looking to find well-timed opportunities, opportunistic entrepreneurs can be impulsive. 2 
 
 
    Innovator    
  Innovators are those rare individuals that come up with a great idea or product that no one has thought of before. Think of Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. These individuals worked on what they loved and found business opportunities through their vision and ideas.
 
 
  Rather than focusing on money, innovators tend to care more about the impact that their products and services have on society. These individuals are not the best at running a business as they are idea-generating individuals, so they often leave the day-to-day operations to those more capable in that respect. 2

"Investment Analyst: Meaning, Education, Positions","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is an Investment Analyst?    
  An investment analyst is a financial professional with expertise in evaluating financial and investment information, typically for the purpose of making buy, sell and hold recommendations for securities. Brokerage firms,  investment advisors  and mutual fund companies hire investment analysts to prepare investment research for multiple purposes.
 
 
  The most prestigious certification an investment analyst can receive is the  Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)  designation. They often have to use a variety of formulas and  means  to identify information.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An investment analyst is a financial professional with expertise in evaluating financial and investment information. Buy-side analysts work for fund managers at mutual fund brokers and financial advisory firms and identify investment opportunities for their firm. Sell-side equity analysts often work for the big investment banks and issue buy, sell and hold recommendations as well as company-specific research. 
 
    The Basics of Being an Investment Analyst    
  An investment analyst researches  economic conditions , company information and market trends to determine business, sector and industry recommendations for buying or selling stocks or mutual funds. A stock analyst stays updated with developments in his industry focus and creates financial models estimating future outcomes for companies and the economy. An analyst evaluates historical and forward-looking financial data, typically through advanced financial models. They study and incorporate research on economic and business trends for a specific industry, geographical region or type of product.
 
 
  Investment analysts broadly come in two types: buy-side analysts and sell-side analysts.  Buy-side  analysts work for fund managers at mutual fund brokers and financial advisory firms. They research companies in their employers' portfolios, as well as other companies that may represent profitable investment opportunities. Based on this research, they prepare reports that offer buy and sell recommendations to management.
 
 
   Sell-side  equity analysts often work for the big  investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs. Their jobs entail researching the financial fundamentals of companies the bank is considering taking public and determining which ones have the strongest potential to become profitable.
 
 
 
 
  For aspiring financial analysts, one of the most important decisions is whether to specialize as an equity analyst or pursue another niche under the broader umbrella of financial analysis. The following comparison explains some of the subtle differences between a career as a financial analyst and an equity analyst.
 
 
   $103,020 
 Average base pay for an investment analyst in the U.S. in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 1 
 
    Analyst Education    
  An undergraduate student typically majors in finance, computer science, biology, physics or engineering and takes courses in business, economics, accounting and math. A  master of business administration (MBA)  is also often preferred for senior investment analysts. Investment analysts may also seek  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)  securities licensing which requires corporate sponsorship. Securities licenses often required by investment analysts include the  Series 7  general securities representative license and the  Series 63  uniform securities agent license. FINRA licenses are typically associated with the selling of specific securities as a firm’s registered representative. Investment analysts may also seek to obtain the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification.
 
 
    Analyst Positions    
  Investment analysis expertise is required in numerous senior investment management roles. A  portfolio manager  chooses, manages and presents products, industries and regions for a company's investment portfolio. Portfolio management is required for a broad range of responsibilities within the investment management industry. Portfolio managers are hired by investment companies to manage all types of funds with various objectives and fund structures. Portfolio managers are responsible for analyzing market conditions and investment securities and making buy and sell decisions for the fund. 
 
 
  A stock investment analyst works on either the buy-side or sell-side for a business. A buy-side analyst is primarily a portfolio management analyst creating investment research and investment recommendations for portfolios with large amounts of capital such as mutual funds,  hedge funds  and insurance companies. A sell-side analyst advises financial service companies on securities, such as stocks or bonds.

"SEC Form 13F: What It Is, Filing Requirements, and Key Issues","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is SEC Form 13F?    
  The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in  assets under management . It discloses their equity holdings and can provide insights into what the  smart money  is doing in the market. 1 
 
 
  Managers are required to file Form 13F within 45 days after the last day of the calendar quarter. Most funds wait until the end of this period in order to conceal their investment strategy from competitors and the public. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The SEC’s Form 13F must be filed quarterly by institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. Congress intended these filings to provide transparency on the holdings of the nation’s biggest investors. Smaller investors frequently use these filings to determine what the “smart money” is doing in the market, but there are serious problems with the reliability and timeliness of the data. 
 
    Understanding SEC Form 13F    
  Congress created the 13F requirement in 1975. Its intention was to provide the U.S. public with a view of the  holdings of the nation's largest institutional investors . Lawmakers believed this would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the nation's financial markets. 2 
 
 
  Firms that are considered institutional investment managers include mutual funds, hedge funds, trust companies, pension funds, insurance companies, and  registered investment advisors .
 
 
  Because 13F filings provide investors with a look at the holdings of Wall Street's top stock pickers, many smaller investors have sought to use the filings as a guide for their own investment strategies. Their rationale is that the nation's largest institutional investors are not only presumably the smartest, but their size also gives them the power to move markets. So investing in the same stocks—or selling the same stocks—makes sense as a strategy.

    Key Issues With SEC Form 13F    
  Smaller investors who want to replicate the strategies of rock star money managers like Daniel Loeb,  David Tepper , or Seth Klarman scrutinize 13F filings. The financial press often reports on what these fund managers have been buying and selling by comparing changes in quarterly filings. But there are a number of problems with 13F filings that warrant caution.
 
 
 
 
    Unreliable Data    
  13F has drawn criticism from many groups who claim it provides a loophole for hedge fund managers. In fact, in a 2010 statement, the SEC itself acknowledged the form had many problems and recommended a number of changes should be made in order to ensure ""useful and reliable data is provided to the public and government regulators."" 3 
 
 
  The SEC's internal review also noted that although ""the SEC would be expected to make extensive use of Section 13(f) information for regulatory and oversight purposes, no SEC division or office conducts any regular or systematic review of the data filed on Form 13F."" 4 
 
 
  Perhaps this explains how infamous fraudster  Bernard Madoff  dutifully filed 13F forms every quarter and still ran a successful Ponzi scheme.
 
 
    Timing of Reporting    
  Another frequent criticism of the form is the fact that it only requires fund managers to file 13F reports 45 days after the end of each quarter. Most managers submit their 13Fs as late as possible because they do not want to tip off rivals to what they are doing. By the time other investors get their hands on those 13Fs, they are looking at stock purchases that may have been made more than four months prior to the filing. 2 
 
 
  In a March 31, 2021 letter to Allison Herren Lee, the acting  chair of the SEC , the progressive nonprofit Americans for Financial Reform urged the SEC to ""expand both the frequency of Form 13F reporting and the range of financial products required to be disclosed on this form."" 5 
 
 
  Another group, the National Investor Relations Institute, recommended the SEC implement a monthly reporting of ownership positions along with a 15-day window. 6 
 
 
    Herd Behavior    
  One risk for both professional and retail investors is the  tendency of money managers  to borrow investment ideas from one another. Hedge fund managers are no more immune to behavioral biases than anyone else. After all, if you are a fund manager, it is safer to be wrong with the majority than wrong alone. This can lead to crowded trades and overvalued stocks. And if small investors are late to the party getting into a trade, they are likely to be late getting out.

"Racketeering Definition, State vs. Federal Offenses, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Racketeering?    
  The term racketeering broadly refers to criminal acts, typically those involving extortion, that involve a ""racket"". A racket, being some sort of scheme organized to  extract illegal profits . It is usually used in reference to patterns of illegal activity specified in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). This is a U.S. federal law that makes it illegal to acquire or control a business through certain crimes or income from those crimes. It is also illegal to participate, even indirectly, in certain crimes committed by a business or to conspire to do any of the above under the act. 1 
 
 
  The list of federal crimes specified in RICO includes bribery,  fraud , gambling offenses,  money laundering , financial and economic crimes, obstructing justice or a criminal investigation, and murder for hire. At the state level, racketeering can include crimes such as murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matters, and drug crimes, as long as they align with the ""generic definition of the state offense referenced at the time RICO was enacted."" 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Racketeering is the act of acquiring a business through illegal activity, operating a business with illegally-derived income, or using a business to commit illegal acts. The U.S. government introduced the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in October 1970 to contain racketeering. Racketeering can be prosecuted at the state or federal level. Federal crimes of racketeering include bribery, gambling offenses, money laundering, obstructing justice or a criminal investigation, and murder for hire. At the state level, racketeering includes crimes such as murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matters, and drug crimes. 
 
    Understanding Racketeering    
  Organized groups may operate illegal businesses, known as rackets. An organized group may also divert funds from a legal business to use for illegal activities. Rackets primarily functioned in obviously illegal industries, such as prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, illegal weapons trade, or counterfeiting.
 
 
  Racketeering can take many forms including:
 
 
 
 
 
 Cyber extortion:  This occurs when a hacker pushes  malware  onto someone's computer, blocking all computer and data access. The hacker then demands money to restore access to the user. 
 Protection rackets:   A criminal entity threatens to cause harm to a business or individual unless they are paid a protection  fee . 
 Kidnapping:  This is considered racketeering when an individual is illegally detained and their captors agree to set the kidnapped individual free once a ransom is paid. 
 Fencing racket:  Individuals act as intermediaries to buy stolen goods from thieves at low rates. They resell them for a  profit  to unsuspecting buyers. 
 Drug trafficking : illegal drugs are produced, smuggled, and sold to the public. 
 Illegal gambling activities:  such as underground casinos, sports books, or card rooms where the ""house"" takes a profit.

  Labor unions have also been a frequent target of racketeering allegations. Organized crime groups generally use one or more labor unions to  extort  money from a company or contractor(s). In other cases, groups use unions to control workers. The Italian-American mafia criminal society, La Cosa Nostra, was famous for its control over  labor unions . La Cosa Nostra gained such a strong foothold that both company management and the labor union had to rely on the gangsters for protection. 3 
 
 
  To contain illegal collusion and profiteering through racketeering, the U.S. government introduced the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in October 1970. 4  The law permits enforcement agencies to charge individuals or groups involved in various acts of racketeering. Individuals guilty of committing RICO crimes may be prosecuted and, if found guilty, can face a 20-year prison sentence or more for serious crimes. Fines and other penalties may also apply. 5 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Corporations may also engage in racketeering. For instance, a drug manufacturer may bribe doctors to overprescribe a medicine, thus committing  fraud  in order to boost their profits.  Predatory lending  may also be deemed a form of racketeering. This happens when a lender tricks a borrower into taking a loan that deliberately ignores or actively hinders their ability to repay it.

"Zero-Bound: Definition, Purpose, How It Works, Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Zero-Bound?    
  Zero-bound is an  expansionary monetary policy  tool where a  central bank  lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy. A central bank that is forced to enact this policy must also pursue other, often unconventional, methods of stimulus to resuscitate the economy.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Zero-bound is an expansionary monetary policy tool where a central bank lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy. Central banks will manipulate interest rates to either stimulate a stagnating economy or dampen an overheating one. The Great Recession forced some international central banks to push the limits of zero-bound below the numerical level and implement negative rates to spur growth and spending. 1 
 
    Understanding Zero-Bound    
  Zero-bound refers to the lowest level that  interest rates  can fall to, and logic dictates that zero would be that level. The main arrow in a central bank's monetary policy quiver is interest rates. The bank will manipulate interest rates to either stimulate a stagnating economy or dampen an overheating one. Clearly, there are limits, especially at the lower end of the range.
 
 
  The zero-bound is the lower limit that rates can be cut to, but no further. When this level is reached, and the economy is still underperforming, then the central bank can no longer provide  stimulus  via interest rates. Economists use the term  liquidity trap  to describe this scenario.
 
 
  When faced with a liquidity trap, alternative procedures for monetary stimulus often become necessary. Conventional wisdom was that interest rates could not move into negative territory, meaning once interest rates reach zero or are close to zero, for example, 0.01%,  monetary policy  has to be altered to continue to stabilize or stimulate the economy.
 
 
  The most familiar alternative monetary policy tool is perhaps  quantitative easing  (QE). This is where a central bank engages in a large-scale asset-buying program, often involving treasuries and other  government bonds . Not only will this keep short-term rates low, but it will push down longer-term rates, which further incentivizes borrowing. 2 
 
 
    Negative Rates    
  Since the  Great Recession  of 2008 and 2009, some central banks pushed the limits of zero-bound below the numerical level and implemented  negative rates . 3  As the global economy plummeted, central banks slashed rates to spur growth and spending. However, as the recovery remained slow, central banks began entering the uncharted territory of negative rates. 
 
 
 
 
  Sweden was the first country to enter this territory, when in 2009 the Riksbank cut the  repo rate  to 0.25%, which pushed the deposit rate to -0.25%. 4  Since then, the  European Central Bank  (ECB), the  Bank of Japan  (BOJ), and a handful of others followed suit at one time or another. 
 
 
  There are instances where negative rates have been implemented during normal times. Switzerland is one such example; through much of the 2010s, its  target interest rate  was-0.75%, which was raised to -0.50% in 2021. 5  Japan similarly had adopted a  negative interest rate policy  (NIRP), with a target rate of -0.1%.
 
 
    Example of Zero-Bound and Negative Interest Rates in Switzerland    
  The  Swiss National Bank  (SNB) maintains a negative interest-rate policy. While there are other examples of negative interest rates, the Swiss example is rather unique in that the country is opting to keep rates very low (and negative) to prevent its  currency  from rising too significantly.
 
 
   Important 
 In the Swiss example, negative interest rates are only applied to Swiss franc bank balances over a certain threshold. 
 
 
 
  Switzerland is viewed as a  safe-haven , with low political and  inflation  risk. Other examples of negative and zero-bound interest rate policies have often come about because of economic turmoil, which requires cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. The Swiss situation doesn't fit this scenario.
 
 
  The SNB has maintained that it must keep rates low to prevent its already relatively high currency value from going even higher. A rising currency hurts the Swiss  export  industry. Therefore, the SNB has taken a two-pronged approach to control the currency. The Bank has actively engaged in currency market interventions to help cap the strong  Swiss franc , and also keeps interest rates low or negative to dissuade strong speculative buying of the franc.
 
 
  In this situation, the SNB will eventually adopt a zero-bound strategy for moving back to 0% and above. However, that won't happen until the central bank feels it can raise rates without causing too significant of a rise in the currency.

Hypothesis Testing: 4 Steps and Example,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Hypothesis testing is a procedure designed to measure the strength of a hypothesis based on sample data. 
    What Is Hypothesis Testing?    
  Hypothesis testing is a method of testing an assumption regarding a population by examining data from a sample. The process is sometimes called significance testing,
 
 
  Hypothesis testing begins when a researcher observes a pattern in a set of data. The test determines whether the pattern can be explained by coincidence or other variables.
 
 
  The methodology used depends on the nature of the data and the reason for the analysis.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The four steps of hypothesis testing include stating the hypotheses, formulating an analysis plan, analyzing the sample data, and interpreting the results. The test provides evidence concerning the plausibility of the hypothesis, given the data. Statistical analysts test a hypothesis by measuring and examining a sample of the population being analyzed. 
 
    How Hypothesis Testing Works    
  In hypothesis testing, an  analyst  tests a statistical sample, intending to provide evidence on the plausibility of the null hypothesis. Statistical analysts measure and examine a random sample of the population being analyzed. All analysts use a random population sample to test two different hypotheses: the  null hypothesis  and the alternative hypothesis.
 
 
  The null hypothesis is usually a hypothesis of equality between population parameters; e.g., a null hypothesis may state that the population mean return is equal to zero. The alternative hypothesis is effectively the opposite of a null hypothesis. Thus, they are  mutually exclusive , and only one can be true. However, one of the two hypotheses will always be true.
 
 
   Important 
 The null hypothesis is a statement about the data that is assumed to be true. 1 
 
 
 
    4-Step Process    
  The steps in hypothesis testing are:
 
 
 
 
   State the hypotheses. Formulate an analysis plan, which outlines how the data will be evaluated. Carry out the plan and analyze the sample data. Interpret the results and either reject the null hypothesis, or state that the null hypothesis is plausible, given the data. 1 
 
 
    Example of Hypothesis Testing    
  If a researcher wants to test if a penny is fair, the null hypothesis would state that the probability of landing on heads is exactly 50%. The alternative hypothesis would assert that the probability of landing on heads is not 50%. Mathematically, these would be represented as follows:
 
 
   Null hypothesis (Ho): P = 0.5 Alternate hypothesis (Ha): P≠0.5 
 
 
  A random sample of 100 coin flips is taken, and the results are recorded. If it is found that the outcomes were 40 heads and 60 tails, the analyst might infer that the penny does not have a 50% chance of landing on heads.
 
 
  Further statistical testing, such as  p-testing , might be performed to determine the likelihood of a fair coin landing heads up 40 times out of 100. If that likelihood is very low, the researcher would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
 
 
  If there were 48 heads and 52 tails, then it is plausible that the coin could be fair and still produce such a result. When the null hypothesis is ""accepted,"" the analyst states that the difference between the expected results (50 heads and 50 tails) and the observed results (48 heads and 52 tails) is ""explainable by chance alone.""
 
 
    Explain Like I'm Five    
  When scientists and researchers notice patterns in data, they need a way to make sure those patterns cannot be explained by coincidence or other variables. Hypothesis testing is a way of comparing different theories to find the best explanation for a pattern.
 
 
  To perform hypothesis testing, the researcher lists different hypotheses about the relationships between the data they are looking at. Then they make a series of observations. The theory that does the best job of explaining their observations is considered the strongest hypothesis.
 
 
   When Did Hypothesis Testing Begin? 
 Some statisticians attribute the first hypothesis tests to satirical writer John Arbuthnot in 1710, who studied male and female births in England after observing that in nearly every year, male births exceeded female births by a slight proportion. Arbuthnot calculated that the probability of this happening by chance was small, and therefore it was due to “divine providence.” 2 
 
 
   What are the Benefits of Hypothesis Testing? 
 Hypothesis testing helps assess the accuracy of new ideas or theories by testing them against data. This allows researchers to determine whether the evidence supports their hypothesis, helping to avoid false claims and conclusions. Hypothesis testing also provides a framework for decision-making based on data rather than personal opinions or biases. By relying on statistical analysis, hypothesis testing helps to reduce the effects of chance and confounding variables, pro","By

"Wire Fraud Laws: Overview, Definition and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Wire Fraud?    
  Wire fraud is a type of  fraud  that involves the use of some form of telecommunications or the internet. These can include a phone call, a fax, an email, a text, or social media messaging, among many other forms. Wire fraud is punishable by prison and/or fines.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Wire fraud is a type of fraud that involves the use of some form of telecommunications or the internet. This type of crime can make use of any and all forms of electronic media including telephone or fax machine, email or social media, or SMS and text messaging. Wire fraud often involves communications made between state or national borders, and is punishable by both hefty fines and jail sentences. 
 
    Understanding Wire Fraud    
  The U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Resource Manual Section 941.18 U.S.C. 1343 cites these as the key elements of wire fraud:
 
 
   “That the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated in a scheme to defraud another out of money That the defendant did so with the intent to defraud That it was reasonably foreseeable that interstate wire communications would be used That interstate wire communications were in fact used” 1 
 
 
  Wire fraud is a federal crime that carries a sentence of up to 20 years’ imprisonment and fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. The  statute of limitations  to bring a charge is five years unless the wire fraud targeted a financial institution, in which case the statute of limitations is 10 years. If the wire fraud is related to special circumstances, such as a presidentially declared state of emergency, or targets a financial institution, it can carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years and a fine of up to $1 million.
 
 
  A person need not have actually defrauded someone or personally sent a fraudulent communication to be convicted of wire fraud. It is sufficient to prove the intent to defraud or acting with knowledge of fraudulent communications being sent. 2 3

    Wire Fraud Then and Now    
  Not long ago, in order to perpetrate a scheme, fraudsters had to rely on the telephone and make hundreds of calls to try to hook a hapless, gullible retiree or lonely heart. The old-fashioned phone call is still useful as a means to contact prey, but today, with the power of the internet to find potential victims, a fraudster’s work can be done online with a few fake postings of pictures, a tale of woe, and a promise of untold riches or everlasting love—and all of this can be written with bad grammar and spelling.
 
 
   Tip 
 If you get messages or solicitations to send money to a stranger, delete them right away. You can also report them to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. 4 
 
 
 
    Example of Wire Fraud    
  A common example of wire fraud is the Nigerian prince scam. In this scam, the scammer sends an email claiming to be a Nigerian prince who is down on his luck in some way, usually exiled, and can’t access the fortune in his Nigerian bank account. He claims to need the target to hold his millions for him and promises to give the target a handsome sum in return. The goal of the scam is to obtain the target’s financial information, which the scammer will use to access the target’s money.
 
 
  Although it’s one of the oldest internet scams in the book, there are still consumers who fall for this rip-off or some variation of it. No matter what the circumstances—whether you receive an email from a wealthy traveler who needs your help getting back to the U.S. or your long-lost cousin who claims to be in an emergency situation—never wire money to a stranger. Once you wire cash (especially overseas), it’s virtually impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the money. If you’re worried about your cousin, check separately. They’ll probably be safe at home, and you can alert them that their email’s been hacked. 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 One of these ""Nigerian princes"" was detained and charged on Dec. 28, 2017. He turned out to be a 67-year-old man from Louisiana. 5  This particular brand of the scheme first popped up in the 1980s and Americans have lost millions of dollars to the scam. 6 
 
 
 
   How Serious Is Wire Fraud? 
 Wire fraud is a federal crime, and a conviction is very serious. You could spend up to 20 years in federal prison and owe $250,000 if you're found guilty of wire fraud. The penalty is even steeper for crimes against financial institutions: You could be imprisoned for 30 years and owe as much as $1 million in fines.

Last Mile: What It Means in Reaching Customers,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Last Mile?    
  The last mile describes the short geographical segment of delivery of communication and media services or the delivery of products to customers located in dense areas. Last mile logistics tend to be complex and costly to providers of goods and services who deliver to these areas.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The last mile refers to the short geographical distance that must be spanned to provide services to end-user customers. Last mile logistics tend to be complex and costly to providers of goods and services who deliver to these areas. In communications, the last mile is the relatively expensive and complex delivery of cables or wiring from the provider's trunk to one's home. Last mile logistics have become a big business and a central focus for both providers of services and consumers. Last mile logistics for product delivery have become a central focus for retailers in the e-commerce era. 
 
    Understanding the Last Mile    
  Delivery of telecommunications and media content is instantaneous and very fast for physical products to the perimeter of a densely populated area. Imagine a trunk line leading to the edge of a city or metropolitan area.
 
 
  The branches and leaves must then spread out across the tightly packed buildings and streets to serve customers working and living there. The edge of the city to the customer inside the city is the last mile.
 
 
  Communications and media providers—inclusive of  broadband  cable, satellite, and wireless—spend heavily to upgrade old delivery systems and build out new networks to ensure adequate bandwidth for consumers hungry for data and streaming capabilities on their televisions, desktop computers, and mobile devices.
 
 
  It takes time for these service providers to implement technology solutions for the ""last mile problem."" Due to the rapidly changing nature of technology, these solutions are at risk of being obsolete, or not state-of-the-art, upon completion.
 
 
    Last Mile Logistics    
  Last mile logistics for product delivery have become a central focus for retailers in the e-commerce era. Our instant-gratification society demands fast delivery of products ordered online. Retailers that can achieve this at low or no cost to the customer have  competitive advantages .
 
 
 
 
  Amazon utilizes third-party services and its own fleet of vehicles to deliver packages to its customers over the last mile. To compete, other retailers are investing more in setting up  distribution centers  as close as possible to metropolitan zones, and then contracting with UPS, USPS, FedEx, and local courier services to perform last mile delivery services.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 In urban areas, deliveries to retail stores, restaurants, and other merchants in a central business district often contribute to congestion and safety problems, making the last mile even more challenging to execute. 
 
 
 
    The Last Mile Problem and Cryptocurrencies    
  The last mile problem has reemerged in the past few years in the context of  cryptocurrencies . In particular, the last mile, in this case, refers to when a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is used in a cross-border payment such as a  remittance .
 
 
  The recipient of the Bitcoin must find a way to exchange it for local currency in order to use it. Thus, while crypto transactions can provide a quick, efficient, and cost-effective way of sending remittances, the last mile problem still stands in the way in many less-developed countries.
 
 
   What Does Last Mile Mean? 
 Last mile refers to the last stage in a process, especially of a customer buying goods. When it is used in the context of transportation, supply chain, manufacturing, and retailing, the last mile is used to describe the delivery of products as the last leg of transportation. 
 
 
   Why Is There a Last Mile Problem? 
 In supply chain management, the last mile describes the difficult last part of the  transportation of packages  from hubs to their final destinations. Some of the problems of last-mile delivery include minimizing cost, ensuring transparency, increasing efficiency, and improving infrastructure. The very last part of the delivery process of a product—from the last distribution center to the end customer—tends to be the most difficult because it can be the most complicated and expensive. 
 
 
   What Is the Last Mile in Terms of Internet Service? 
 In Internet industries, the last mile refers to the final leg of the telecommunications networks that deliver telecommunication services to customers. It is the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the customer's premises. 
 
 
   Are the First Mile and the Last Mile Problems the Same? 
 The first mile problem is generally used in the context of public transit systems. The first/last mile is the distance between a traveler’s origin or destination and a transit station. Reducing this distance is considered to be the solution to both","By

"Variable Interest Rate: Definition, Pros & Cons, Vs. Fixed","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Variable Interest Rate?    
  A variable interest rate (sometimes called an “adjustable” or a “floating” rate) is an interest rate on a loan or security that fluctuates over time because it is based on an underlying benchmark interest rate or index that changes periodically.
 
 
  The obvious advantage of a variable interest rate is that if the underlying interest rate or index declines, the borrower’s interest payments also fall. Conversely, if the underlying index rises, interest payments increase. Unlike variable interest rates, fixed interest rates do not fluctuate. 1 ﻿
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A variable interest rate fluctuates over time because it is based on an underlying benchmark interest rate or index that changes periodically with the market. The underlying benchmark interest rate or index for a variable interest rate depends on the type of loan or security, but it is frequently linked to the LIBOR or the federal funds rate. Variable interest rates can be found in mortgages, credit cards, corporate bonds, derivatives, and other securities or loans. 
 
    Understanding Variable Interest Rates    
  A variable interest rate is a rate that moves up and down with the rest of the market or along with an index. The underlying benchmark interest rate or index for a variable interest rate  depends on the type of loan  or security, but it is often associated with either the  London Inter-Bank Offered Rate  (LIBOR) or the  federal funds rate .
 
 
  Variable interest rates for mortgages, automobiles, and  credit cards  may be based on a benchmark rate, such as the  prime rate  in a country. Banks and financial institutions charge consumers a  spread  over this benchmark rate, with the spread depending on several factors, such as the type of asset and the consumer’s  credit rating . Thus, a variable rate may bill itself as “the LIBOR plus 200 basis points” (plus 2%). 2 
 
 
   Residential mortgages, for instance, can be obtained  with fixed interest rates, which are static and cannot change for the duration of the mortgage agreement, or with a floating or adjustable interest rate, which is variable and changes periodically with the market. Variable interest rates can also be found in credit cards, corporate bond issues, swap contracts, and other securities. 3 
 
 
 
 
  Primarily available in the United Kingdom and some European countries,  tracker mortgages  are variable-rate loans that use a base rate from the Bank of England or the European Central Bank.
 
 
   Important 
 Due to recent scandals and questions around its validity as a benchmark rate, LIBOR is being phased out. According to the Federal Reserve and regulators in the U.K., LIBOR will be phased out by June 30, 2023, and will be replaced by the  Secured Overnight Financing Rate  (SOFR). As part of this phase-out, LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates will no longer be published after December 31, 2021. 4 ﻿  
 
 
 
    Variable-Interest-Rate Credit Cards    
  Variable-interest-rate credit cards have an  annual percentage rate  (APR) tied to a particular index, such as the prime rate. The prime rate most commonly changes when the Federal Reserve adjusts the federal funds rate, resulting in a change in the rate of the associated credit card. The rates on variable-interest-rate credit cards can change without advance notice to the cardholder. 5 ﻿
 
 
   Important 
 Variable-interest-rate credit cards can change rates without telling their customers. 
 
 
 
  Within the “terms and conditions” document associated with the credit card, the interest rate is most commonly expressed as the prime rate plus a particular percentage, with the listed percentage being tied to the creditworthiness of the cardholder. 5 ﻿ An example of the format is the prime rate plus 11.9%.
 
 
    Variable-Interest-Rate Loans and Mortgages    
  Variable-interest-rate loans function similarly to credit cards except for the payment schedule. While a credit card is considered a revolving line of credit, most loans are installment loans, with a specified number of payments leading to the loan being paid off by a particular date. As interest rates vary, the required payment will go up or down according to the change in rate and the number of payments remaining before completion.
 
 
  When a mortgage has a variable interest rate, it is more commonly referred to as an  adjustable-rate mortgage  (ARM). Many ARMs start with a low fixed interest rate for the first few years of the loan, only adjusting after that period has expired. Common fixed-interest-rate periods on an ARM are three, five, or seven years, expressed as a 3/1, 5/1, or 7/1 ARM, respectively. There are also usually adjustment “caps” that put a limit on how much the interest rate can go up or down when it adjusts. 6 ﻿ You can use an  online calculator  to get an estimate of current interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages.
 
 
  In most cases, ARMs have rates that adjust based on a","By

 Definition 
 The law of supply and demand combines two fundamental economic principles that describe how changes in the price of a resource, commodity, or product affect its supply and demand. 
    What Is the Law of Supply and Demand?    
  The law of supply and demand compares supplier preferences (i.e. supply) with consumer preferences (i.e. demand). All else being equal, supply rises while demand declines as the price increases. Levels of supply and demand for varying prices can be plotted on a graph as curves, and the intersection of these curves marks the  equilibrium  or market-clearing price at which demand equals supply and represents the process of  price discovery  in the marketplace.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The law of demand holds that the demand level for a product or a resource will decline as its price rises and rise as the price drops. The law of supply says that higher prices boost the supply of an economic good and lower ones tend to diminish it. A market-clearing price balances supply and demand and can be graphically represented as the intersection of the supply and demand curves. The degree to which changes in price translate into changes in demand and supply is known as the product's price elasticity. Demand for basic necessities is relatively inelastic. It's less responsive to changes in their price. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Alex Dos Diaz 
 
    Understanding the Law of Supply and Demand    
  It may seem obvious that the price satisfies both the buyer and the seller in any sale transaction, matching supply with demand. The interactions between supply, demand, and price in a free marketplace have been observed for thousands of years. 1 
 
 
  Many medieval thinkers distinguished between a ""just"" price based on costs and equitable returns and one at which the sale was transacted, just like modern-day critics of market pricing for select commodities. 2 
 
 
  Our understanding of price as a signaling mechanism matching supply and demand is rooted in the work of Enlightenment economists who studied and summarized the relationship.
 
 
 
 
  Supply and demand don't necessarily respond to price movements proportionally. The degree to which price changes affect the product's demand or supply is known as its price elasticity.

   Fast Fact 
 Price discovery based on supply and demand curves assumes a marketplace in which buyers and sellers are free to transact or not depending on the price. 
 
 
 
  Products with a high  price elasticity of demand  will see wider fluctuations in demand based on the price. Basic necessities will be relatively inelastic in price because people can't easily do without them so demand will change less relative to changes in the price.
 
 
  Factors such as taxes and government regulation, the market power of suppliers, the availability of substitute goods, and economic cycles can all shift the supply or demand curves or alter their shapes. However, the commodities affected by these external factors remain subject to the fundamental forces of supply and demand as long as buyers and sellers retain agency.

Stop-Limit Order: What It Is and Why Investors Use It,"Definition 
 A stop-limit order is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at the limit price, but only if the stop price has been reached. 
    What Is a Stop-Limit Order?    
  A stop-limit order is a conditional trade over a set time frame that combines the features of stop with those of a limit order and is used to mitigate risk. It is related to other order types, including limit orders (an order to either buy or sell a specified number of shares at a given price or better) and stop-on-quote orders (an order to either buy or sell a security after its price has surpassed a specified point).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Stop-limit orders are a conditional trade that combine the features of a stop loss with those of a limit order to mitigate risk. Stop-limit orders enable traders to have precise control over when the order should be filled, but they are not guaranteed to be executed. The stop price dictates the price whether the order is triggered, then the limit price dictates the price at which the order is filled. Stop-limit orders offer risk management, automation, and flexibility in trading, though they do not protect against price gaps and are slightly more complex to set. Traders often use stop-limit orders to lock in profits or limit downside losses. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    How Stop-Limit Orders Work    
  The primary benefit of a stop-limit order is that the  trader  has precise control over when the order should be filled. The  downside , as with all limit orders, is that  the trade is not guaranteed  to be executed if the stock/commodity does not reach the stop price during the specified time period.
 
 
  A stop-limit order requires the setting of two price points: the stop price and the limit price. First, set the stop price, which is the price that will trigger the trade. If the price of the security reaches the stop price, the trade will be triggered.
 
 
  Then, set the limit price. The limit price is the worst price that you are willing to accept to buy or sell the security. For a buy order, the limit is the maximum price you want to pay for the trade. For sell orders, it is the minimum price that you are willing to receive. You will also need to set a time frame and the number of shares that you want to trade. 
 
 
 
 
  The stop-limit order will be executed at a specified price, or better after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a  limit order  to buy or sell at the limit price or better. This type of order is an available option with nearly every  online broker .

  It's important to note that stop-limit orders do not guarantee that your trade will be executed. If the price of the security drops quickly or there is a gap in trading, the order may not be filled at the desired limit price or at all. 1  This may result in missed opportunities for profit should the appropriate prices not be targeted.
 
 
    Features of Stop and Limit Orders    
  A  stop order  is an order that becomes executable once a set price has been reached and is then filled at the current market price. A traditional stop order will be filled in its entirety, regardless of any changes in the current market price as the trades are completed.
 
 
  A limit order is one that is set at a certain price. It is only executable at times when the trade can be performed at the limit price or at a price that is considered more favorable than the limit price. If trading activity causes the price to become unfavorable regarding the limit price, then the activity related to the order will be ceased. By combining the two orders, the investor has much greater precision in executing the trade.
 
 
  A stop order is filled  at the market  price after the stop price has been hit, regardless of whether the price changes to an unfavorable position. This can lead to trades being completed at less than desirable prices should the market adjust quickly. Combining the stop order with the features of a limit order ensures that the order will not get filled once the pricing becomes unfavorable, based on the investor’s limit.
 
 
  Thus, in a stop-limit order, after the stop price is triggered, the limit order takes effect to ensure that the order is not completed unless the price is at or better than the limit price that the investor has specified. 1 
 
 
   Tip 
 Stop-limit orders are free for most brokers; make sure you understand your broker's fee structure before setting orders to avoid unexpected fees.

 Definition 
 An annual return measures the growth of an investment, on average, each year during a specific period. It is a commonly used method for comparing the performance of liquid investments. 
    What Is an Annual Return?    
  An annual return is the  return  that an investment provides over time. It's expressed as a time-weighted annual percentage. Sources of returns can include dividends, returns of capital, and capital appreciation. The rate of annual return is measured against the initial amount of the investment and it represents a  geometric mean  rather than a simple arithmetic mean.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An annual or annualized return is a measure of how much an investment has increased on average each year during a specific period. The annual return is calculated as a geometric average to show what the annual return compounded would look like. It can be more useful than a simple return when you want to see how an investment has performed over time or to compare two investments. An annual return can be determined for a variety of assets including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, and certain derivatives.

    How an Annual Return Works    
  An annual return can be calculated for various assets including stocks, bonds, funds, commodities, and some types of  derivatives . It's the standard method for comparing the performance of investments with  liquidity . This process is a preferred method, considered to be more accurate than a simple return because it includes adjustments for compounding interest. Different asset classes tend to have different strata of  annual returns . 1 
 
 
    Annual Returns on Stocks    
  The annual return expresses a stock’s increase in value over a designated period. Information regarding the current price of the stock and the price at which it was purchased is required to calculate it. The purchase price must be adjusted accordingly if any splits have occurred. The simple return percentage is calculated first when the prices are determined with that figure ultimately being annualized. 2 
 
 
  The simple return is the current price minus the purchase price divided by the purchase price.
 
 
 
 
    Example of the Annual Return Calculation    
   CAGR = ( ( Ending Value Beginning Value  ) 1 Years ) − 1 where: CAGR = compound annual growth rate Years = holding period, in years \begin{aligned} &\text{CAGR} = \left ( \left ( \frac{ \text{Ending Value} }{ \text{Beginning Value } } \right ) ^ \frac{ 1 }{ \text{Years} } \right ) - 1 \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{CAGR} = \text{compound annual growth rate} \\ &\text{Years} = \text{holding period, in years} \\ \end{aligned} ​ CAGR = ( ( Beginning Value  Ending Value ​ ) Years 1 ​ ) − 1 where: CAGR = compound annual growth rate Years = holding period, in years ​ 
 Consider an investor who purchases a stock for $20 on Jan. 1, 2024. The investor then sells the stock on Jan. 1, 2029, for $35 and realizes a $15 profit. The investor also receives a total of $2 in dividends over the five-year holding period. The investor's total return over five years would be $17, or (17/20) 85% of the initial investment. 
 The annual return required to achieve 85% over five years follows the formula for the compound annual growth rate (CAGR): 
 ( ( 3 7 2 0 ) 1 5 ) − 1 = 1 3 . 1 %  annual return \begin{aligned} &\left ( \left ( \frac { 37 }{ 20 } \right ) ^ \frac{ 1 }{ 5 } \right ) - 1 = 13.1\% \text{ annual return} \\ \end{aligned} ​ ( ( 2 0 3 7 ​ ) 5 1 ​ ) − 1 = 1 3 . 1 %  annual return ​

 Definition 
 Organizational behavior is the academic study of human behavior in group settings. 
    What Is Organizational Behavior (OB)?    
  Organizational behavior (OB), the study of how people interact in a group, is widely used in business to improve the performance of individuals and the group as a whole. As an academic subject, organizational behavior is studied in business, psychology, and sociology disciplines.
 
 
  Organizational behavior includes research on improving job performance, increasing job satisfaction, promoting innovation, and encouraging  leadership .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Organizational behavior is a foundation of corporate human resources programs, with elements such as employee retention, engagement, training, and culture. Academic programs on organizational behavior draw on anthropology, ethnography, and leadership studies. The Hawthorne Effect, which describes how people's behavior changes when they know they are being observed, is the best-known study of organizational behavior.

    Learning Organizational Behavior    
  Academic programs focusing on organizational behavior are found in business schools, as well as at schools of social work and psychology. These programs draw from the fields of anthropology, ethnography, and leadership studies and use quantitative, qualitative, and computer models as methods to explore and test ideas.
 
 
  Depending on the program, one can study specific topics within organizational behavior or broader fields within it. Specific topics covered include cognition, decision-making, learning, motivation, negotiation, impressions, group process, stereotyping, and power and influence. The broader study areas include social systems, the dynamics of change, markets, relationships between organizations and their environments, how social movements influence markets, and the power of  social networks .
 
 
 
 
    Why Is It Important to Study Organizational Behavior?    
  Studying organizational behavior allows an organization to understand how its employees behave and interact with each other and the organization itself. Using the results, organizations can implement changes that enhance performance and efficiency, as well as improve employee satisfaction.

    Organizational Behavior Origins    
  The study of organizational behavior has its roots in the late 1920s, when the Western Electric Company launched a now-famous series of studies of the behavior of workers at its Hawthorne Works plant in Cicero, Illinois. 1 
 
 
  Researchers there set out to determine whether workers could be made to be more productive if their environment was upgraded with better lighting and other design improvements. To their surprise, the researchers found that the environment was less important than social factors. It was more important, for example, that people got along with their co-workers and felt their bosses appreciated them.
 
 
  Those initial findings inspired a series of wide-ranging studies between 1924 and 1933. 1  They included the effects on productivity of work breaks, isolation, and lighting, among many other factors.

Emergency Fund: Uses and How to Build Yours,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 An emergency fund is a cash reserve designed to cover sudden financial expenses so you don’t have to rely on your regular savings account, credit cards, or loans. 
    What Is an Emergency Fund?    
  An emergency fund is money set aside to cover unexpected expenses. Setting up an emergency fund provides you with a financial safety net whenever you come across unforeseen circumstances, including day-to-day expenses after a job loss or unexpected medical bills, among other things.
 
 
  An emergency fund should be set up in an easily accessible vehicle if the need arises. Your emergency fund should never be used to pay for nonessential expenses, but it should be replenished whenever it is used.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Not having an emergency fund can lead to financial shock and disrupt your savings or add to your debt. To establish an emergency fund, set your goal, determine how much you can out of each paycheck, look for other ways to save, and increase your contribution when you can. Emergency funds are meant to cover things like expenses after a job loss or unexpected medical bills, not impulse spending. 
 
    How Emergency Funds Work    
  Emergency funds can be helpful to cover everything from everyday expenses after a  job loss  or drop in  income , or paying for emergency  medical bills , home repairs, and other financial emergencies. The shock from these (and other) sudden costs can be devastating, which is why it’s important to set one up.
 
 
  Not having an emergency fund can be stressful, disrupting your other savings and the potential for increased  debt . That’s because when an emergency arises, you may have to rely on other savings vehicles, such as a vacation fund or  retirement accounts , or debt like  credit cards  and  loans .
 
 
  The amount of money you hold in your emergency fund depends entirely on your situation and goals. However, most experts suggest keeping three to six months of expenses in savings to help you when you need it. 1  So, how do you get there? Make sure you understand how income changes and unforeseen situations can impact your life and set realistic goals. Try to save small amounts to help you reach that amount.

   Fast Fact 
 Emergency funds are also known as rainy day funds, contingency funds, and “life happens” funds. 
 
 
 
    How to Build Your Emergency Fund    
  Building an emergency fund requires time and discipline, so it does require some work on your end. We’ve outlined some of the basic steps below to make it a little easier to achieve this goal.
 
 
 
 Set your goal. While you can’t anticipate the cost of an unexpected  car repair  or medical expense, adding up your monthly expenses can help you determine how much to save. So if your expenses are $1,000 and you want to set aside three months’ worth, you’ll have to save $3,000. 
 Determine how much you can save. Saving may seem tough if you’re  living paycheck to paycheck , but it isn’t impossible. Setting aside a small amount—even $25 per paycheck—can help. If you use cash, any small change can also go into your fund. 
 Look for other ways to save. Ask yourself if you can make cuts in certain areas, including  discretionary spending . This is nonessential spending, such as dining out, entertainment, and subscription services. For instance, consider canceling your gym membership if your condo complex has a facility or cutting down the number of days you go out to eat each week. 
 Review your progress. Do a regular check-in to see where you are and how close you are to reaching your goal. This can help keep you on track. 
 
 
  Increase your emergency fund contribution whenever possible. Resist the urge to spend any unexpected money you get and put it into your emergency fund, at least until you reach your goal. This includes money from a raise, a bonus, or a birthday check from your parents.
 
 
  You should also make sure that you refill your account anytime you have to access it.
 
 
   Tip 
 You can make saving easier by setting up automatic transfers from your  checking account  to your emergency fund account. 
 
 
 
    How to Keep Your Emergency Fund    
  Your emergency fund should be housed in a liquid account. This means putting the money into an account or vehicle that you can easily access without having to jump through hoops or incur fees and penalties.
 
 
  The following are a few options you may want to consider:

 Form 10-K is a required annual filing where a company details its financial situation and circumstances for the prior year. 
    What Is Form 10-K?    
  Form 10-K is an annual financial report that publicly-traded companies must file with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . Some of the data required in a 10-K includes the company's history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and other relevant data.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The 10-K is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is far more detailed than the annual report. Information in the 10-K includes corporate history, financial statements, earnings per share, and any other relevant data. The 10-K is a useful tool for investors to make important decisions about their investments. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A company's Form 10-K can be found on the SEC's EDGAR database and on the company's investor relations website. 
 Investopedia / Yurle Villegas 
 
    Understanding Form 10-K    
  Because of the depth and nature of the information they contain,  10-Ks  are fairly long and tend to be complicated. But  investors  need to understand that this is one of the most comprehensive and most important documents a public company can publish on a yearly basis. The more information they can gather from the 10-K, the more they can understand the company. Canadian companies will file  SEC Form 40-F  to provide this information.
 
 
  The government requires companies to publish 10-K forms so investors have accurate information and can make informed investment decisions. This form gives a clearer picture of everything a company does and what kinds of risks it faces.
 
 
   Important 
 Most companies publish their 10-Ks and other required filings on the Investor Relations section of their website. You can also find them using the company search function through the SEC's EDGAR database. 1 
 
 
 
  The 10-K includes five distinct sections:
 
 
 
 
 
 Business .   This provides an overview of the company’s main operations, including its products and services (i.e., how it makes money). 
 Risk factors .   These outline any and all risks the company faces or may face in the future. The risks are typically listed in order of importance. 
 Selected financial data .   This section details specific financial information about the company over the last five years. This section presents more of a near-term view of the company’s recent performance. 
 Management’s discussion and analysis  of financial condition and results of operations. Also known as  MD&A , this gives the company an opportunity to explain its business results from the previous fiscal year. This section is where the company can tell its story in its own words. 
 Financial statements and supplementary data .   This includes the company’s audited financial statements including the income statement,  balance sheets , and statement of cash flows. A letter from the company’s independent auditor certifying the scope of their review is also included in this section. 2

Is Deflation Bad for the Economy?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Deflation?    
  Deflation is when prices decrease over time. It stands in contrast to  inflation , which is when prices rise. Deflation can be driven by many different factors, including an increase in productivity and the abundance of goods and services, a decrease in total or  aggregate demand , or a decrease in the supply of money and credit. Most of the time deflation is a good thing, but sometimes it can indicate a contraction of the economy.
 
 
  When deflation occurs throughout an economy, this typically means there is a  fall in the overall level of prices  and an increase in the  purchasing power  of the currency.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Deflation is when prices in a country are falling. Deflation can be caused by an increase in productivity, a decrease in overall demand, or a decrease in the volume of credit in the economy. Most of the time, deflation is unambiguously a positive trend for the economy, but it can also, under certain conditions, occur along with a contraction in the economy.  In an economy dominated by debt-fueled asset price bubbles, deflation can lead to a temporary financial crisis and a period of liquidation of speculative investment known as debt deflation. 
 
    Understanding Deflation    
  Changes in consumer prices can be observed in economic statistics compiled in most nations by comparing changes in a  basket  of diverse goods and products to an index. In the U.S. the  Consumer Price Index  (CPI) is the most commonly referenced index for evaluating inflation rates. When the index in one period is lower than in the previous period, the general level of prices has declined, indicating that the economy is experiencing deflation.
 
 
  This general decrease in prices is a good thing because it gives consumers greater purchasing power. To some degree, moderate drops in certain items, such as food or energy, even have some  positive effect  on increasing nominal consumer spending. Beyond these basic staples, a general, persistent fall in all prices not only allows people to consume more but can promote economic growth and stability by enhancing the function of  money as a store of value  and encouraging real saving. 
 
 
  However, under certain circumstances, rapid deflation can be associated with a short-term contraction of economic activity. In general, this can occur when an economy is heavily laden with debt and dependent on the continuous expansion of the supply of credit to inflate asset prices by financing speculative investment, and subsequently, when the volume of  credit  contracts,  asset  prices fall, and speculative over-investments are liquidated. This process is known as  debt deflation .
 
 
 
 
  Otherwise, deflation is normally a  positive feature of a healthy, growing economy  that reflects technological progress, increasing abundance, and rising living standards.
 
 
    Deflation: Causes and Effects    
  If, as the common saying goes, inflation is the result of too much money chasing not enough goods in the economy, then conversely deflation can be understood as a growing supply of goods and services being chased by a constant or slower-growing supply of money.
 
 
  This means that deflation can be brought about either by an increase in the supply of goods and services or by a lack of increase (or decrease) in the supply of money and credit. In either case, if prices can adjust downward, then this results in a generally falling price level.  
 
 
  An increase in the supply of goods and services in an economy typically results from technological progress, the discovery of new resources, or an increase in productivity.
 
 
  Consumers' purchasing power increases over time. Living standards rise as the increasing value of wages and business incomes allow consumers to purchase, use, and consume more and better quality goods and services.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The U.S. government targets an annual inflation rate of 2%. 
 
 
 
  At times, some economists have expressed fears that falling prices would paradoxically reduce consumption by inducing consumers to hold out or delay purchases in order to pay lower prices in the future. However, there is little evidence that this actually occurs during normal periods of economic growth accompanied by falling prices due to improvements in productivity, technology, or resource availability. 
 
 
  Moreover, the vast majority of consumption is made up of goods and services that are not easily deferred to the future, such as food, clothing, housing services, transportation, and healthcare.
 
 
  Beyond these basic needs, even for luxury and discretionary spending, consumers would only choose to reduce current spending if they expect the rate of decrease in prices to outweigh their natural  time preference  for present consumption over future consumption.
 
 
  The one type of consumer spending that would suffer from falling prices would be items that are routinely financed by taking on large debts,","By

    What Was the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)?    
  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented to promote trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The agreement, which eliminated most tariffs on trade among the three countries, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994. Numerous tariffs, particularly those related to agricultural products, textiles, and automobiles, were gradually phased out through Jan. 1, 2008.
 
 
  NAFTA was terminated and replaced by the  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)  in 2020.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented in 1994 to encourage trade among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. 
 NAFTA reduced or eliminated tariffs on imports and exports among the three participating countries, creating a huge free-trade zone. 
 Two side agreements to NAFTA aimed to establish high common standards in workplace safety, labor rights, and environmental protection, to prevent businesses from relocating to other countries to exploit lower wages or looser regulations. 
 It was later replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was signed on Nov. 30, 2018, and went into full force on July 1, 2020. 
 NAFTA was a controversial agreement, harming the U.S.  economy  in some measures and improving it in others.

    Understanding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)    
  NAFTA was an agreement that created a  free trade area  among the three major countries in North America: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The deal was signed by the three parties in 1992 and went into effect two years later. 1 
 
 
  It aimed to encourage economic activity among North America’s three major economic powers. Its primary focus was to open up and expand  trade  in the agricultural, automotive, and textile industries. Some of its main goals included:
 
 
 
 
   Reduction of trade barriers Creation of trade rules Improvement of working conditions Establishment of a safe market for North American goods and services Expansion of global trade and cooperation

  Proponents of the agreement believed that it would benefit the three nations involved by promoting freer trade and lower tariffs among them. Some experts also suggested that aligning Mexico with the more established economies of the U.S. and Canada would help boost its  economic growth . 2 
 
 
    History of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)    
  Legislation for NAFTA was developed during George H.W. Bush’s presidency as the first phase of his  Enterprise for the Americas Initiative . The agreement was built on an existing agreement between the U.S. and Canada: the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement from 1989. The U.S. began trade talks with Mexico three years later, adding Canada to the negotiations. 3 
 
 
  The Clinton administration believed NAFTA would create 200,000 U.S. jobs within two years and a million within five years because exports played a major role in U.S. economic growth.

 The DuPont analysis is a formula that assesses how effectively a company is using the capital invested by its shareholders by dividing the company's net income by its shareholder equity. 
    What Is the DuPont Analysis?    
  The DuPont analysis is a framework for analyzing a company's fundamental performance. Developed decades ago at DuPont de Nemours, Inc., the DuPont analysis breaks out the different drivers of return on equity (ROE), allowing company managers and investors to focus on them individually and identify strengths and weaknesses.
 
 
  There are two versions of the tool—one that involves three steps and another that uses five.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 DuPont analysis breaks out the various drivers of return on equity (ROE) such as profitability and asset utilization. Managers can use it to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed. An investor can use it to compare the operational efficiency of two similar companies. The DuPont formula has been in use since 1919. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Management uses DuPont analysis to identify areas where they can improve efficiency and profitability. 
 Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi 
 
    How the DuPont Analysis Works    
  The DuPont analysis is a formula used to evaluate a company's financial performance based on its return on equity (ROE). By most accounts, it was  devised in 1919  by a DuPont executive. 1 
 
 
  A company's ROE is calculated by  dividing its net income by shareholders' equity . It reveals how well a company utilizes capital from shareholders.
 
 
  A DuPont analysis goes a step further and allows an investor to determine which financial activities contribute the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can also use the DuPont analysis to compare the  operational efficiency  of two similar companies, while company managers can use it to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed.

  There are three major financial metrics that drive ROE:
 
 
 
 Operating efficiency , which is represented by  net profit margin  or net income divided by total sales or revenue 
 Asset use efficiency , which is measured by the  asset turnover ratio 
 Financial  leverage , a metric that is measured by the equity multiplier, which is equal to average assets divided by average equity

  The DuPont analysis is an expanded return on equity formula, calculated by multiplying the net profit margin by the asset turnover by the  equity multiplier .

    What Is Business-to-Consumer (B2C)?    
  The term business-to-consumer (B2C) refers to the process of selling products and services directly between a business and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. Most companies that sell directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies.
 
 
  B2C became immensely popular during the  dotcom  boom of the late 1990s when it was mainly used to refer to online retailers who sold products and services to consumers through the internet.
 
 
  As a business model, business-to-consumer differs significantly from the  business-to-business  (B2B) model, which refers to commerce between two or more businesses.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Business-to-consumer refers to the process of businesses selling products and services directly to consumers, with no middle person. B2C typically refers to online retailers who sell products and services to consumers through the internet. Online B2C became a threat to traditional retailers, who profited from adding a markup to the price. However, companies like Amazon, eBay, and Priceline have thrived, ultimately becoming industry disruptors.

    Understanding Business-to-Consumer (B2C)    
  Business-to-consumer (B2C) is among the most popular and widely known sales models. Michael Aldrich first utilized the idea of B2C in 1979 and used television as the primary medium to reach out to consumers. 1 
 
 
  B2C traditionally referred to mall shopping, eating out at restaurants, pay-per-view movies, and infomercials. However, the rise of the internet created a whole new B2C business channel in the form of  e-commerce  or selling goods and services over the internet.
 
 
  Although many B2C companies fell victim to the subsequent dotcom bust as investor interest in the sector dwindled and venture capital funding dried up, B2C leaders such as Amazon and Priceline survived the shakeout and have since seen tremendous success.
 
 
 
 
  Any business that relies on B2C sales must maintain good relations with its  customers  to ensure they return. The company must  regularly review its marketing  for good performance and adjust it when necessary.
 
 
  Business-to-business (B2B) marketing campaigns are geared to demonstrate the value of a product or service. Companies that rely on B2C usually  try to catch the eye of the consumer  and elicit an emotional response to their marketing.
 
 
    B2C Storefronts vs. Internet Retailers    
  Traditionally, many manufacturers sold their products to retailers with physical locations. Retailers made profits on the markup they added to the price paid to the manufacturer. But that changed once the  internet  came. New businesses arose that promised to sell directly to the  consumer , thus cutting out the middle person—the retailer—and lowering prices. During the bust of the dotcom boom in the 1990s, businesses fought to secure a web presence. Many retailers were forced to shut their doors and went out of business.
 
 
  Decades after the dotcom revolution, B2C companies with a web presence continue to dominate over their traditional brick-and-mortar competitors. Companies such as Amazon, Priceline, and eBay are survivors of the early dotcom boom. They have gone on to expand upon their early success to become industry disruptors.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Online B2C can be broken down into five categories: direct sellers, online intermediaries, advertising-based B2C, community-based, and fee-based.

 Definition 
 Pro rata is a term that describes the distribution or allocation of assets in equal portions. 
    What Is Pro Rata?    
  Pro rata is a Latin term that translates to ""in proportion."" Put simply, it is used to describe a proportionate allocation. It's a process in which an allocated asset is distributed in equal portions. An amount is assigned to one person according to their share of the whole if something is distributed to several people on a pro rata basis. A pro rata calculation is often used in business finance but can also determine the appropriate portions of any given whole.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Pro rata typically means that everyone gets their fair share. It means proportionally, such as dividends awarded to investors based on their investment. The concept of pro rata is rooted in fractions because proration attempts to make two fractions equal, but with different denominators. The practice of prorating can be applied to billing for services, paying out dividends, or allocating business partnership income. Pro rata is calculated by dividing the instance of an item by the maximum quantity of that item. This ratio can then be applied to any related item to find the same proportion.

    Understanding Pro Rata    
  Pro rata typically means that each party or person receives their fair share in proportion to the whole. Pro rata calculations can be used in many areas, including determining  dividend  payments. These are cash payments by corporations made to shareholders.
 
 
  Pro rata in the insurance industry is used to determine the amount of  premium  due for a policy that only covers a partial term. Allocating the appropriate portion of an annual interest rate to a shorter time frame can also be done on a pro rata basis.
 
 
  Pro rata is also used to determine how much of a distribution from a qualified retirement account, such as an IRA, SEP, or  401(k) , is taxable when the account contains before and after-tax dollars. 1  An account holder might have a 401(k) funded with 20% pre-tax dollars and 80% post-tax dollars. Withdrawals will consist of 20% taxable and 80% non-taxable money as a result.
 
 
 
 
    How to Calculate Pro Rata    
  Pro rata is calculated based on three factors:

  Pro Rata Distribution = Pro Rata Share x Quantity of Related Item
 
 
  Imagine an employee is set to receive a $10,000  bonus  this year. They'll receive a pro rata share of the bonus if they leave at any point. The employee leaves on March 20. The agreement awards the bonus based on the number of days worked, inclusive of the last day.
 
 
  Divide the number of true items by the maximum quantity possible to calculate the pro rata share. The number of true items is the number of days worked. There are 79 days inclusive between January 1 and March 20, assuming it's not a leap year. The maximum number of days possible is 365.
 
 
  Pro rata share = 79 ÷ 365 = 21.64%

Understanding Endowments: Types and Policies That Govern Them,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 An endowment is a financial gift to a nonprofit organization that maintains the principal amount while using the investment income for specific purposes defined by the donor. 
    What Is an Endowment?    
  An endowment is a gift to a nonprofit organization to be used for a specific purpose.
 
 
  The term endowment is also used to refer to the total investable assets of a nonprofit institution like a university. Also known as the institution's “ principal ” or “corpus,” it's used for operations or programs that are consistent with the wishes of the donor(s). 1 
 
 
  Most endowments are designed to keep the principal amount intact while the income is used to further the cause specified by the beneficiary. A  restricted endowment  must be held in perpetuity with only the income available for spending.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Endowments are usually awarded by trusts, private foundations, or public charities. They benefit nonprofit educational institutions, cultural institutions, and service-oriented organizations. Most endowments come with restrictions that limit their use to the investment income of the fund, not the principal. 
 
    Understanding Endowments    
  Endowments are typically organized as a  trust ,  private foundation , or public charity. Many benefit educational institutions, Others go to cultural institutions including museums, libraries, religious organizations, private secondary schools, and service-oriented organizations such as retirement homes or hospitals. 2 
 
 
  Only a certain percentage of an endowment’s assets can be used each year in some cases so the amount withdrawn from the endowment could be a combination of interest income and principal. The ratio of principal to income can change from year to year based on prevailing market rates.

    Policies of Endowments    
  Endowment funds are governed by the guidelines of three components including an investment policy, a withdrawal policy, and a usage policy. 
 
 
 
 
    Investment policy    
  The investment policy lays out which types of investments a manager is permitted to make and dictates how much risk the manager can take in seeking the target return. Many endowment funds have specific investment policies built into their legal structure so the pool of money lasts for the long term.
 
 
  The endowment funds of larger universities can have hundreds if not thousands of smaller funds that invest pools of money in various securities or  asset classes . The funds typically have long-term investment goals such as a specific rate of return or yield. The  asset allocation  or mix of investments within the fund is designed to meet the long-term returns in the fund’s objectives. 3 
 
 
    Withdrawal policy    
  The withdrawal policy establishes the amount the organization or institution is permitted to take out from the fund at each period or installment. It can be based on the needs of the organization and the amount of money in the fund but most endowments have an annual withdrawal limit.
 
 
  An endowment might limit the withdrawals to 5% of the total amount in the fund. Most university endowments are established to last forever and therefore have annual spending limits. 
 
 
    Usage policy    
  The usage policy establishes the purposes for which the fund can be used. Endowments can have multiple uses whether they're set up by an institution or given as a gift by donors. These include ensuring the financial health of specific departments, awarding merit scholarships or fellowships, or providing other financial assistance to students.
 
 
  University chair positions or endowed professorships can be paid with the revenue from an endowment, freeing up capital that can be used to hire more faculty. These chair positions are considered prestigious and are reserved for senior faculty.
 
 
  Endowments can also be established for specific disciplines, departments, or programs within universities. Smith College has an endowment for its botanical gardens and Harvard University has more than 14,600 separate endowment funds. 4 5 
 
 
    Endowment Types    
  There are four types of endowments: 6 
 
 
   Unrestricted Endowment:  This consists of assets that can be spent, saved, invested, or distributed at the discretion of the institution receiving the gift. Term Endowment:  The principal can be expended after a period of time or a certain event. Quasi Endowment:  A donation is made to serve a specific purpose. The principal is typically retained while the earnings are spent per the donor's specifications. These endowments are often started by the institutions that benefit from them via inte","By

What Are Preference Shares and What Are the Types of Preferred Stock?,"Definition 
 Preference shares or preferred stock are a class of stock that receive dividends before common stock. 
    What Are Preference Shares?    
  Preference shares, more commonly referred to as  preferred stock , are shares of a company’s stock with dividends that are paid out to shareholders before common stock dividends are issued. If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders.
 
 
  Most preference shares  have a fixed dividend , while common stocks generally do not. Preferred stock shareholders also typically do not hold any voting rights, but common shareholders usually do.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Preference shares (preferred stock) are company stock with dividends that are paid to shareholders before common stock dividends are paid out. There are four types of preferred stock - cumulative (guaranteed), non-cumulative, participating and convertible. Preference shares are ideal for risk-averse investors and they are callable (the issuer can redeem them at any time). 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Jessica Olah 
 
    Understanding Preference Shares    
  Preference shares fall under four categories: cumulative preferred stock, non-cumulative preferred stock, participating preferred stock and convertible preferred stock. 1 
 
 
   Cumulative preferred stock  includes a provision that requires the company to pay shareholders all dividends, including those that were omitted in the past, before the common shareholders are able to receive their dividend payments. These dividend payments are guaranteed but not always paid out when they are due. Unpaid dividends are assigned the moniker ""dividends in arrears"" and must legally go to the current owner of the stock at the time of payment. At times additional compensation (interest) is awarded to the holder of this type of preferred stock.
 
 
 
 
  Quarterly Dividend = [(Dividend Rate) x (Par Value)] ÷ 4
 
 
  Cumulative Dividends per share = Quarterly Dividend x Number of Missed Payments
 
 
  Non-cumulative preferred stock does not issue any omitted or unpaid dividends. If the company chooses not to pay dividends in any given year, the shareholders of the non-cumulative preferred stock have no right or power to claim such forgone dividends at any time in the future.
 
 
   Participating preferred stock  provides its shareholders with the right to be paid dividends in an amount equal to the generally specified rate of preferred dividends, plus an additional dividend based on a predetermined condition. This additional dividend is typically designed to be paid out only if the amount of dividends received by common shareholders is greater than a predetermined per-share amount. If the company is liquidated, participating preferred shareholders may also have the right to be paid back the purchasing price of the stock as well as a pro-rata share of remaining proceeds received by common shareholders.
 
 
  Convertible preferred stock includes an option that allows shareholders to convert their preferred shares into a set number of common shares, generally any time after a pre-established date. Under normal circumstances, convertible preferred shares are exchanged in this way at the shareholder's request. However, a company may have a provision on such shares that allows the shareholders or the issuer to force the issue. How valuable convertible common stocks are is based, ultimately, on how well the  common stock  performs.
 
 
    What are preference shares?    
  Preference shares, also known as  preferred shares , are a type of security that offers characteristics similar to both  common shares  and a  fixed-income security . The holders of preference shares are typically given priority when it comes to any dividends that the company pays. In exchange, preference shares often do not enjoy the same level of voting rights or upside participation as common shares.
 
 
    What are the main types of preference shares?    
  There are four main types of preference shares: cumulative preferred, non-cumulative preferred, participating preferred, and convertible. Holders of cumulative preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends retroactively for any dividends that were not paid in prior periods, whereas non-cumulative preferred shares do not carry this provision. For this reason, cumulative preferred shares will generally be more expensive than non-cumulative preferreds. Similarly, participating preferred shares offer the benefit of additional dividends if certain performance targets are reached, such as company profits exceeding a specified level. Convertible preferreds, like  convertible bonds , allow the holder to convert their preference shares into common shares at a specified  exercise price .

 Definition 
 Cost of Goods Sold refers to the direct costs associated with producing the goods that a company sells while excluding indirect expenses like distribution and sales costs. 
    What Is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?    
  Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.
 
 
  Cost of goods sold is also referred to as ""cost of sales.""
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Cost of goods sold (COGS) includes all of the costs and expenses directly related to the production of goods. COGS excludes indirect costs such as overhead and sales and marketing. COGS is deducted from revenues (sales) in order to calculate gross profit and gross margin. Higher COGS results in lower margins. The value of COGS will change depending on the accounting standards used in the calculation. COGS differs from operating expenses (OPEX) in that OPEX includes expenditures that are not directly tied to the production of goods or services. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu 
 
    Why Is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Important?    
  COGS is an important metric on financial statements as it is subtracted from a company’s revenues to determine its  gross profit . Gross profit is a profitability measure that evaluates how efficient a company is in managing its labor and supplies in the production process.
 
 
  Because COGS is a  cost of doing business , it is recorded as a business expense on income statements. Knowing the cost of goods sold helps analysts, investors, and managers estimate a company’s bottom line. If COGS increases, net income will decrease. While this movement is beneficial for income tax purposes, the business will have less profit for its shareholders. Businesses thus try to keep their COGS low so that net profits will be higher. 1 
 
 
 
 
    What Is Included in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?    
  Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the  cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products  or finished goods that a company then sells during a period, so the only costs included in the measure are those that are directly tied to the production of the products, including the  cost of labor , materials, and manufacturing overhead. 2

  For example, COGS for an automaker would include  the material costs  for the parts that go into making the car plus the labor costs used to put the car together. The cost of sending the cars to dealerships and the cost of the labor used to sell the car would be excluded.
 
 
  Furthermore, costs incurred on the cars that were not sold during the year will not be included when calculating COGS, whether the costs are direct or indirect. In other words, COGS includes the direct cost of producing goods or services that were purchased by customers during the year. As a rule of thumb, if you want to know if an expense falls under COGS, ask: ""Would this expense have been an expense even if no sales were generated?""

Enterprise Value (EV) Formula and What It Means,"What Is Enterprise Value (EV)?    
  Enterprise value (EV) measures a company’s total value. Its calculation includes not only the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt, as well as any cash or cash equivalents on the company’s balance sheet. It is often used as a more comprehensive alternative to  market capitalization  when valuing a company.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Enterprise value (EV) measures a company’s total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization. EV is calculated using information from a company's financial statement. Enterprise value takes into account the market capitalization of a company, as well as short-term and long-term debt and any cash on the company’s balance sheet. Enterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure a company’s performance. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Michela Buttignol / Investopedia 
 
    How Enterprise Value (EV) Works    
  Enterprise value (EV) differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm’s value. EV tells investors or interested parties a company’s value and how much another company would need if it wanted to purchase that company.
 
 
  A company’s EV can be negative if the total value of its cash and cash equivalents surpasses that of the combined total of its market cap and debts. This is a sign that a company is not using its assets very well—it has too much cash sitting around not being used. Extra cash can be used for many things, such as distributions, buybacks, expansion, research and development, maintenance, employee pay raises, bonuses, or paying off debts.
 
 
  Enterprise value uses figures from a company’s financial statements and current market prices. The components that make up EV are:
 
 
 
 Market cap : The total value of a company’s outstanding common and preferred shares 
 Debt : The sum of long-term and short-term debt 
 Preferred equity:  Preferred shares of equity need to be included as well since they are claimed on the company's equity not included in market capitalization. 
 Minority interest : The equity value of a subsidiary with less than 50% ownership 
 Cash and cash equivalents : The total amount of cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), drafts, money orders, commercial paper, marketable securities, money market funds, short-term government bonds, or Treasury bills that a company possesses

 To calculate market capitalization—if not readily available online—you would multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt on the company’s balance sheet, including both short-term and long-term debt. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result.

A Beginners' Guide to Managing Your Money,"Close 
 
 
 
  The Internet has changed the way we live our lives. Not long ago, purchasing stock was not as easy as it is now. The order went through a complex network of brokers and specialists before the execution was completed. In 1983, that all changed when a dentist in Michigan made the first online stock transaction using a system developed by what is now  E*TRADE . 1 
 
 
  Online brokers and easy access to financial data make investing your money as simple as starting a savings account. But in an Internet-driven, do-it-yourself world, is investing also a do-it-yourself activity?
 
 
  If so, why not just fire your  financial advisor , pay fewer fees to your mutual funds, and set up a portfolio of your own? We look at some of the basics of managing your own money before you actually become your own financial manager.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The wealth of information available online may offer inexperienced investors with a false sense of security. It's important to understand modern portfolio theory and risk. Watch the market first in order to learn how it works and how it reacts to daily events.  Set up a virtual paper trading account so you don't lose more money than you should. 
 
    Should You Manage Your Own Money?    
  That first trade, made by E*Trade co-founder William Porter, changed the way investment products are researched, discussed, bought, and sold. Computerized trading has resulted in highly  liquid markets , making it easy to buy and sell most securities quickly. 2 
 
 
  The do-it-yourselfer now has access to the same free financial data professionals use. Websites like  Stocktwits  set up entire communities of investors and traders who exchange information in real time.
 
 
  But just because it's possible, does that mean managing your own money is a good idea? Professional investors have a saying: ""The stock market is an expensive place to learn how to invest.""
 
 
  They understand that it's easier to lose money than it is to make money, and because of that, some argue that the wealth of information available to people with an inexperienced financial background may offer a false sense of security.
 
 
 
 
  Tools are only as good as the knowledge and experience of the person using them. Does a high-priced software package used by the world's best composers result in beautiful music? Does the newest innovation in surgical technology make a person with no prior training in the field a top-performing surgeon?
 
 
  There's no doubt that the Internet has given the  retail investor  the tools that they need to effectively manage their own money, but what about the knowledge and experience to use the tools effectively? For an investor who wants to manage their own money, what types of fundamental knowledge should they have before firing their financial adviser?
 
 
    Modern Portfolio Theory    
  It's important to get a grasp of  modern portfolio theory (MPT)  and gain an understanding of how asset allocation is determined for an individual based on their individual factors. In order to gain a true understanding of these principles, you'll have to dig deeper than the top-level Internet articles that tell you that MPT is simply understanding allocation.
 
 
  MPT is not just about the allocation, but also its efficiency. The best money managers understand how to position your money for maximum return with the least amount of risk. They also understand that efficiency is highly dynamic as the person ages and their financial picture changes.
 
 
  Along with efficiency comes the dynamic nature of  risk tolerance . At certain points in our lives, our risk tolerance may change. Along with retirement, we might have intermediate financial goals like saving for college or starting a new business; the portfolio has to be adjusted to meet those goals.

    Understanding Risk    
  In the plethora of free resources available, risk is treated too benignly. The term risk tolerance has been so overused that retail investors may believe that they understand the risk if they understand that investing may involve losing money from time to time. But it's not really that simple. In fact, it's much more than that.
 
 
  Risk is a behavior that is hard to understand rationally because investors often act against their best interests. A study conducted by Dalbar showed that inexperienced investors tend to buy high and sell low, which often leads to losses in short-term trades. 3

What Is Indemnity Insurance? How It Works and Examples,"Definition 
 Indemnity insurance is a type of policy that compensates professionals and business owners for certain unexpected damages or losses, typically covering legal costs and settlements when they are found at fault for a specific event. 
    What Is Indemnity Insurance?    
  The term indemnity insurance refers to an  insurance  policy that compensates an insured party for certain unexpected damages or losses up to a certain limit—usually the amount of the loss itself. Insurance companies provide coverage in exchange for  premiums  paid by the insured parties.
 
 
  These policies are commonly designed to protect professionals and business owners when they are found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment or malpractice. They generally take the form of a  letter of indemnity .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Indemnity insurance is a type of insurance policy where the insurance company guarantees compensation for losses or damages sustained by a policyholder.  Indemnity insurance is designed to protect professionals and business owners when found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment. Certain professionals must carry indemnity insurance including those involved in financial and legal services, such as financial advisors, insurance agents, accountants, mortgage brokers, and attorneys. Medical malpractice, professional liability, and errors and omissions insurance are examples of indemnity insurance.

    How Indemnity Insurance Works    
   Indemnity  is a comprehensive form of insurance compensation for damages or loss. In a legal sense, it may also refer to an  exemption  from  liability  for damages. The insurer promises to make the insured party whole again for any covered loss in exchange for premiums the policyholder pays.
 
 
  Indemnity insurance is a supplemental form of  liability insurance  specific to certain professionals or service providers. Insurance professionals provide counsel, expertise, or specialized services. Also referred to as  professional liability insurance , indemnity insurance is nothing like general liability or other forms of commercial liability insurance that protect businesses against claims of bodily harm or property damage.
 
 
 
 
  Indemnity insurance protects against  claims  arising from possible negligence or failure to perform that result in a client’s financial loss or legal entanglement. A client who suffers a loss can file a civil claim. In response, the professional’s indemnity insurance will pay litigation costs as well as any damages awarded by the court.
 
 
  As with any other form of insurance, indemnity insurance covers the costs of an indemnity claim including but not limited to court costs,  fees , and settlements. The amount covered by insurance depends on the specific agreement, and the cost of the insurance depends on many factors including the history of indemnity claims.
 
 
  Typical examples of indemnity insurance include professional insurance policies like  malpractice insurance  and errors and omissions insurance (E&O). These special insurance policies indemnify or reimburse professionals against claims made as they conduct their business.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Certain professionals are strongly advised to carry indemnity insurance. These professionals include those involved in financial and legal services, such as  financial advisors , insurance agents, accountants,  mortgage brokers , and attorneys. When dispensing financial or legal advice, these professionals are potentially liable for negligence or inadequate performance despite the intent of goodwill.
 
 
  In the financial industry, a professional who provides financial advice that results in the purchase of an insurance or investment product can purchase  errors and omissions insurance , to protect themselves, if the advice given causes damages. For example, accountants may be found negligent for advising a client on tax matters that in turn result in a penalty or additional taxes.
 
 
   Important 
 Indemnity insurance also covers court costs, fees, and settlements in addition to an indemnity claim. 
 
 
 
  In the medical field,  malpractice insurance  is a form of professional indemnity insurance. Malpractice insurance protects medical practitioners from civil claims arising from negligence that results in physical or mental harm to patients. Medical malpractice insurance is required in some states, but optional in most.
 
 
  Many executives purchase indemnity insurance to protect their deferred compensation plans against company claims or  bankruptcy . Other professions, such as contractors, consultants, and maintenance professionals, carry indemnity insurance as a practical matter due to their exposure to failure to perform claims.
 
 
  Professional indemnity insurance provides a critical layer of protection for service providers. Often these professionals might also need other form",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indemnity_insurance.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

    What Is an Original Issue Discount (OID)?    
  An original issue discount (OID) is the discount in price from a bond's  face value  at the time a  bond  or other debt instrument is first issued.
 
 
  Bonds can be issued at a price lower than their face value—known as a  discount . The OID is the amount of discount or the difference between the original face value and the price paid for the bond.
 
 
  Original issue discounts are used by bond issuers to attract buyers to purchase their bonds so that the issuers can raise funds for their business. Many  zero-coupon bonds  use large OIDs to entice buyers to their products.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The original issue discount (OID) is the difference between the original face value amount and the discounted price paid for a bond. OID bonds have the potential for gains since investors can buy the bonds for a lower price than their face value. OID bonds sold at a discount could indicate an issuer is facing financial difficulty and default is possible. 
 
    How an Original Issue Discount (OID) Works    
  Once purchased, the bond's issuer usually pays the bondholder an interest rate—called a  coupon —while the investor holds the bond. Periodically, the bondholder receives interest payments based on the rate of the bond. When the bond reaches  maturity , the investor gets the return of the face value paid for the bond.
 
 
  However, some bonds sell for a price less than the face or par value of the note. The OID is the difference between the price paid for a bond and its face value. The OID may be considered interest since the buyer is paid the face value of the bond at maturity even though the purchase price was lower than the face value.

  For example, let's say that a bond has a $100 face value, meaning the investor would receive $100 returned at the maturity date. If the investor buys the bond for $95 and receives $100 at maturity, the OID is $5, which is the return on the investment.
 
 
  If a bond offering the OID is zero-coupon, then the only money made is at maturity when the face value is paid back.
 
 
 
 
    Formula and Calculation of OID    
  The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price and the issuance price (the discounted offering price of the debt.)
 
 
   OID = Redemption Price – Issuance Price 
 
 
   Redemption Price: The par value of the bonds (the amount obligated to be returned on the date of maturity.) Issuance Price: The offering price that the bonds were sold for on the date of sale. 
 
 
    Example of How to Calculate OID    
  Let's say that a company wants to offer a $100,000 bond (redemption price), but is willing to accept $90,000 in capital (issuance price). Therefore, the OID equals $10,000:
 
 
  OID  =  $100,000 - $90,000 = $10,000 
 
 
    OIDs and Interest Rates    
  A company can have a bond that sells  at a discount  to its face value while it also pays periodic interest. However, the amount of OID tends to correlate with the interest rate on the bond inversely. In other words, the bigger the discount, the lower the coupon rate offered on the bond.
 
 
  The reason for the negative correlation is that companies might issue a bond at a discount to its face value, so the company does not have to p","0 seconds of 1 minute, 2 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oid.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
Quadruple (Quad) Witching: Definition and How It Impacts Stocks,"Definition 
 The quadruple witching hour is the last sixty minutes of the trading day on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December when contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously. 
    What Is Quadruple Witching?    
  ""Quadruple witching"" refers to the simultaneous expiration four times a year of stock options, index futures, and index futures options derivatives contracts. The fourth type of contract involved in quadruple witching, single-stock futures, hasn't traded in the U.S. since 2020 and was never a major contributor to equity trading volumes. 1  What is now effectively ""triple witching"" occurs on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Equity trading volume tends to rise on these days and is typically heaviest during the last hour of trading as traders adjust their portfolios. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Quadruple witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures derivatives contracts four times a year. Quadruple witching has given way to triple witching since single stock futures stopped trading in the U.S. in 2020. This event occurs once every quarter, on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Trading volume typically surges on triple witching days as traders adjust portfolios and roll some contracts. Triple witching does not usually cause increased market volatility.

   March 20 June 19 Sept. 18 Dec. 18 
 
 
  During the last hour of trading on these days, known as the quadruple witching hour, market activity might increase as traders adjust positions and roll over contracts. 
 
 
    Understanding Quadruple Witching    
  The four  derivatives  contracts accounting for the 'quadruple' in quadruple witching are stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures. While single stock futures now only trade outside the U.S., the quarterly expiration of index futures and index options, coinciding with the monthly expiration of stock options, produces a flurry of trading.
 
 
  Despite the evocative name, what happens during what is now  triple witching  is not a supernatural phenomenon nor a mystery. Market makers who've sold expiring stock and index options contracts close out the matched hedge positions, boosting trading volume. Meanwhile, the rolling of contracts ahead of expiration also increases turnover in the options and futures markets.
 
 
  Another factor is quarterly index rebalancing, also known as  reconstitution , on the ""witching"" day. That means portfolio managers tracking rebalancing indexes, including those from S&P Dow Jones in the U.S. and FTSE in the U.K., may need to trade reflecting index changes.
 
 
    Types of Contracts Involved in Quadruple Witching    
  Now that you know what quadruple witchings are all about, let's take a look at the four classes of contracts that can expire on these dates.
 
 
    Stock Options    
   Options  are derivatives, which means they derive their value from underlying securities such as stocks. Options contracts give a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to trade a set number of shares of the underlying security at a given strike price at any time before options expire.
 
 
  There are two types of options:
 
 
   A call option may be bought to speculate on a price increase in a particular stock. If the share price is higher than the strike price on the option's expiration date, the investor can exercise the option to buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price and resell them at the higher market price or may simply sell the option at a profit before expiration. A put option lets an investor profit from a decline in a stock's share price, as long as the price is below the strike at expiration. 
 
 
  Monthly stock options contracts expire on the third Friday of every month. Option buyers pay an upfront cost known as the  option premium . 2

    What Is Mercantilism?    
  Mercantilism was an economic system of trade that spanned the 16th century to the 18th century. Mercantilism was based on the principle that the world's wealth was static, and consequently, governments had to regulate trade to build their wealth and national power. Many European nations attempted to accumulate the largest possible share of that wealth by maximizing their exports and limiting their imports via  tariffs . 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Mercantilism was the dominant economic system from the 16th century to the 18th century. Mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation's wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and reducing imports. It's characterized by the belief that global wealth was static and that a nation's economic health relied heavily on its supply of capital. Due to the nationalistic nature of mercantilism, nations frequently used military might to protect local markets and supply sources. Mercantilism was replaced by free-trade economic theory in the mid-18th century.

    Understanding Mercantilism    
  Mercantilism was a form of economic nationalism that sought to increase the prosperity and power of a nation through restrictive trade practices. Its goal was to increase the supply of a state's  gold  and  silver  with exports rather than to deplete it through imports. 1  It also sought to support domestic employment.
 
 
  Mercantilism centered on the interests of merchants and producers (such as England's East India Company and the Dutch East India Company) and protected their activities as necessary. 2 3 
 
 
  Mercantilism had several noteworthy characteristics.

  Financial wealth was considered limited (due to the rarity of precious metals). Nations that sought prosperity and power needed to secure as much wealth as possible, at the expense of other nations.
 
 
 
 
   2. The Need to Increase the Supply of Gold 
 
 
  Gold represented wealth and power. It could pay for soldiers, seafaring exploration for natural resources, and expanding empires. It could also protect against invasion. A lack of gold meant the downfall of a nation.
 
 
   3. The Need to Maintain a Trade Surplus 
 
 
  This was integral to building wealth. Nations needed to focus on selling their exports (and collecting the associated revenue) more than on spending on imports (and sending gold out of countries).
 
 
   4. The Importance of a Large Population 
 
 
  Large populations represented wealth. Increasing a nation's population was integral to supplying a labor force, supporting domestic commerce, and maintaining armies.
 
 
   5. The Use of Colonies to Support Wealth 
 
 
  Some nations needed colonies for raw materials, a labor supply, and a way to keep wealth within its control (by selling colonies the products their raw materials helped to produce). Essentially, colonies increased a nation's wealth-building power and national security.
 
 
   6. The Use of Protectionism 
 
 
  Protecting a nation's ability to build and maintain trade surpluses encompassed prohibiting colonies from trading with other nations and imposing tariffs on imported goods.

Nominal: What It Means in Finance and Economics,"What Is Nominal?    
  Nominal is a common financial term with several different meanings. In the first, it means very small or far below the real value or cost. In finance, this adjective modifies words such as a fee or charge. A nominal fee is below the price of the service provided or presumably easy for a consumer to afford, or a fee that is small enough that it does not have any meaningful impact on one's finances. Nominal may also refer to a rate that's been unadjusted for inflation.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Nominal is a financial term that has several different contexts. 
 It can mean small or far below the real value or cost such as a nominal fee. 
 Nominal also refers to an unadjusted rate in value such as interest rates or GDP. 
 In finance, the  real interest  rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. 
 
 
    Types of Nominals    
  In finance and economics, nominal may also refer to an unadjusted rate or the change in value. When defining items like the gross domestic product (GDP) or interest rates, nominal points to a figure that is unadjusted for  seasonality , inflation, interest  compounding , and other modifiers. In this use, nominal shows the contrast to ""real"" economic statistics that do make such adjustments or modifications to results.
 
 
  Because a nominal figure will deal with the unadjusted value of a study, it is best not to use it as a comparative figure. Consider someone who has $100 in 1950 versus someone with $100 in 2020. Although both people may have $100—which is the nominal value—the real value is not the same, where the nominal value does not factor in inflation. The nominal value of an asset can also mean its face value. For example, a bond with a face value of $1,000 has a nominal value of $1,000.
 
 
    Nominal vs. Real    
  The term real, as opposed to nominal, expresses the value of something after making adjustments for various factors in creating a more accurate measure. For example, the difference between nominal and real GDP is that nominal GDP measures the economic output of a country using current market prices, and real GDP takes inflation into account to create a more accurate measure.
 
 
    Nominal vs. Real Rate of Return    
  The  rate of return  (RoR) is the amount an investor earns on an investment. While the nominal rate of return reflects the investor's earnings as a percentage of the initial investment, the real rate takes inflation into account. As a result, the real rate gives a more accurate assessment of the actual buying power of the investor's earnings.
 
 
 
 
  For example, imagine you buy a $10,000 stock and sell it the following year for $11,000. Your nominal rate of return is 10%. However, to get a more accurate picture of your  actual return , this rate needs to be adjusted for inflation, as the  purchasing power  of your money has likely changed over the one year. Therefore, if inflation for that year is 4%, the real rate of return is only 6% or the nominal rate of return minus the rate of inflation.
 
 
    Nominal vs. Real Interest Rates    
  Like the difference between nominal and real rates of return, the difference between nominal and real interest rates is that the latter is adjusted for inflation. 1  For example, if an investment is expected to return 7% interest, but the inflation rate is 4%, then the  real interest rate  on that investment is only 3%.
 
 
  However, in terms of interest, the nominal rate also contrasts with the  annual percentage rate  (APR) and the  annual percentage yield  (APY). In the case of APY, the nominal, or stated rate is the rate the lender advertises, and it is the basic interest rate the consumer pays on the loan.
 
 
  On the other hand, APR takes into account fees and other costs associated with the loan, and it calculates the interest rate with those factors in mind. For example, imagine a borrower takes out a $1,000 loan with a 5% nominal interest rate, but they also pay a $100 origination fee. During the first year of the loan, they face $50 in interest fees. However, when we factor in the origination fee, they pay $150 in fees and interest.
 
 
  This total fee sum equates to a 15% APR. Conversely, APY takes both the fees and the effect of compounding into account to give the borrower an even more accurate picture of their interest rate.
 
 
    Example of Nominal    
  As in the example above, the nominal value for someone who has $100 in 1950 does not change for someone who has $100 in 2020. What does change is the  purchasing power , where inflation decreases purchasing power over time. Assuming an average annual inflation rate of 3.46% from 1950 to 2020, then what $100 would buy in 1950 would cost $1,081 in 2020. Thus, the real value of $100 in 1950 would be $1,081 in 2020.

Unsecured Loans: Borrowing Without Collateral,"What Is an Unsecured Loan?    
  An unsecured loan is a loan that doesn’t require any type of  collateral . Instead of relying on a borrower’s assets as security, lenders approve unsecured loans based on a borrower’s  creditworthiness . 1 
 
 
  Examples of unsecured loans include personal loans, student loans, and credit cards.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An unsecured loan is supported only by the borrower’s creditworthiness, rather than by any collateral, such as property or other assets. Unsecured loans are riskier than secured loans for lenders, so they require higher credit scores for approval. Credit cards, student loans, and personal loans are examples of unsecured loans. If a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the lender may commission a collection agency to collect the debt or take the borrower to court. Lenders can decide whether or not to approve an unsecured loan based on a borrower’s creditworthiness, but laws protect borrowers from discriminatory lending practices. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    How an Unsecured Loan Works    
  Unsecured loans—sometimes referred to as  signature loans  or personal loans—are approved without the use of property or other assets as collateral. The terms of these loans, including approval and receipt, are most often contingent on a borrower’s  credit score . Typically, borrowers must have high credit scores to be approved for unsecured loans.
 
 
  An unsecured loan stands in contrast to a  secured loan , in which a borrower pledges some type of asset as collateral for the loan. The pledged assets increase the  lender ’s “security” for providing the loan. Examples of secured loans include mortgages and car loans.
 
 
  Because unsecured loans require higher credit scores than secured loans, in some instances, lenders will allow loan applicants with insufficient credit to provide a  co-signer . A co-signer takes on the legal obligation to fulfill a debt if the borrower  defaults . This occurs when a borrower fails to repay the  interest  and  principal  payments of a loan or debt.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Because unsecured loans are not backed by collateral, they are riskier for lenders. As a result, these loans typically come with higher  interest rates . 
 
 
 
  If a borrower defaults on a secured loan, the lender can repossess the collateral to recoup the losses. In contrast, if a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the lender cannot claim any property. But the lender can take other actions, such as commissioning a collection agency to collect the  debt  or taking the borrower to court. If the court rules in the lender’s favor, the borrower’s wages may be  garnished .
 
 
  Also, a  lien  can be placed on the borrower’s home (if they own one), or the borrower may be otherwise ordered to pay the debt. Defaults can have consequences for borrowers, such as lower credit scores.
 
 
    Types of Unsecured Loans    
  Unsecured loans include personal loans, student loans, and most credit cards—all of which can be  revolving  or  term loans .
 
 
  A revolving loan is a loan that has a credit limit that can be spent, repaid, and spent again. Examples of revolving unsecured loans include  credit cards  and personal  lines of credit .
 
 
  A term loan, in contrast, is a loan that the borrower repays in equal installments until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. While these types of loans are often affiliated with secured loans, there are also unsecured term loans. A  consolidation loan  to pay off credit card debt or a signature loan from a bank would also be considered unsecured term loans.
 
 
  In recent years, the unsecured loan market has experienced growth, powered partly by  financial technology (fintech)  firms. The past decade, for example, has seen the rise of  peer-to-peer (P2P) lending  via online and mobile lenders.

 The amount of U.S. consumer revolving debt in Oct. 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. 2 
 
  If you’re looking to take out an unsecured loan to pay for personal expenses, a  personal loan calculator  is an excellent tool for determining what the monthly payment and total interest should be for the amount you’re hoping to borrow.
 
 
    Unsecured Loan vs. Payday Loan    
  Some lenders offer  flex loans for people who need access to cash . Flex loans are a type of line of credit and carry higher interest rates. They are an option available to those with poor or no credit history.
 
 
  Alternative lenders, such as payday lenders or companies that offer merchant  cash advances , do not offer secured loans in the traditional sense. Their loans are not secured by tangible collateral in the way that mortgages and car loans are. However, these lenders take other measures to secure repayment.
 
 
   Payday lenders , for example, require that borrowers give them a postdated check or agree to an automatic withdrawal from their checking accounts to repay the loan. Many online merchant","By

What Is a Balanced Scorecard (BSC)? Examples and Uses,"Definition 
 The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) grades a company's performance from the perspective of customer satisfaction, operational excellence, and business innovation as well as financial success. 
    What Is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC)?    
  The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a framework for evaluating a company that goes beyond its financial performance to also take into account the company's success in satisfying customers, operating effectively, and innovating for the future.
 
 
  This four-pronged approach to grading a company was introduced by business scholars Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton in a Harvard Business Review article in 1992. 1 
 
 
  Their broadened performance measurement is designed to give organizations a complete picture of their overall health and help leaders implement long-term strategy, synchronize daily operations with their objectives, and foster ongoing enhancements. 2 
 
 
  The Balanced Scorecard approach has been adopted by Fortune 500 corporations, including Apple and Volkswagen, as well as public-sector organizations and nonprofits. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Balanced Scorecard's four standard perspectives are designed to interact to improve long-term financial results. The system allows organizations to convert abstract vision statements into concrete measurable objectives. It expands the organization's focus from current financial performance to long-term success and innovation. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Michela Buttignol 
 
    Understanding the Balanced Scorecard    
  Kaplan and Norton argued that ""what you measure is what you get,"" highlighting the need for a more balanced set of metrics to steer organizational behavior toward strategic objectives. 2  They demonstrated through case study research that traditional financial metrics like ROI and EBITDA often failed to capture the drivers of future performance, such as process capabilities and employee competencies. 3 
 
 
 
 
  To remedy this, the authors proposed adding customer, internal process, and learning & growth measures to financial data, creating a multidimensional dashboard that reflects an organization’s strategic priorities. This integration enabled managers to focus on leading indicators of success, rather than relying solely on lagging financial results that could mask emerging opportunities or risks.
 
 
  Beyond its academic roots, the Balanced Scorecard quickly became a popular tool in strategic planning cycles, board-level performance reviews, and as the foundation for incentive compensation models. Firms can use BSCs to align departmental goals with overall corporate strategy, manage individual business units, and drive cultural change. 1  In the public sector, organizations also utilize the BSC to demonstrate accountability, monitor service quality, and meet regulatory requirements.
 
 
  Today, digital dashboards and software platforms feature automatic data collection and reporting, further enhancing the BSC’s role as a real-time strategic management system. 4 
 
 
    The Four BSC Perspectives    
 
 Financial Perspective : Traditional financial objectives, such as revenue growth and profitability, alongside cost management and  asset utilization,  make up the main focus of this analysis. Standard financial assessment tools encompass  return on capital employed  (ROCE),  net profit margin , and cash flow benchmarks. Focusing on these metrics ensures that an organization's strategic initiatives generate tangible financial outcomes, instead of just abstract targets. 
 Customer Perspective:  The focus here lies in comprehending and fulfilling customer expectations, looking at metrics such as customer satisfaction scores, retention rates, and market share. Businesses evaluate their products and services through net promoter scores (NPS) and customer lifetime value (CLV) to determine how well they connect with their intended audiences. Companies build  brand loyalty  and encourage repeat business by aligning their operational procedures with customer requirements. 
 Internal Business Perspective : This examines how well critical processes perform and maintain quality standards that support fulfilling customer value and achieving financial objectives. The essential performance metrics, known as  key performance indicators  (KPIs), track cycle times, defect rates, and process yield measures. Organizations track these metrics to pinpoint bottlenecks while optimizing operations and developing innovative process improvements. 
 Learning and Growth Perspective:  This dimension evaluates the organization's capacity to innovate and improve through organizational learning and adaptation. These metrics include the number of training hours employees receive, skill development programs, investments in technology, and employee engagement levels. Long-term organizational success depends on investment in  human capital  development and new product innovation.

 Definition 
 Regression tries to determine how a dependent variable and one or more other (independent) variables relate to each other. It’s a statistical method. 
    What Is Regression?    
  Regression is a statistical method that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps predict or understand how changes in the independent variable(s) are associated with changes in the dependent variable.
 
 
  Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. It establishes the  linear relationship  between two variables and is also referred to as simple regression or ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
 
 
  Linear regression is graphically depicted using a straight  line of best fit , with the slope defining how the change in one variable impacts a change in the other. The y-intercept of a linear regression relationship represents the value of the dependent variable when the value of the independent variable is zero.  Nonlinear regression  models also exist but are far more complex.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables. A regression model shows whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the independent variables. It does this by determining a best-fit line to see how the data is dispersed around this line. Regression helps economists and financial analysts with challenges ranging from asset valuation to making predictions. Several assumptions about the data and the model itself must hold for regression results to be properly interpreted. 
 
  Regression is used in economics to help investment managers value assets and understand the relationships between factors such as  commodity  prices and the  stocks  of businesses dealing in those commodities. It’s a powerful tool for uncovering the associations between variables observed in data, but it can’t easily indicate causation.
 
 
  Regression as a statistical technique shouldn’t be confused with the concept of regression to the mean, also known as  mean reversion .

    How Regression Works    
  Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a dataset and quantifies whether those correlations are  statistically significant . The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and  multiple linear regression , but there are nonlinear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis.
 
 
  Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y. Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome. Analysts can use  stepwise regression  to examine each independent variable contained in the linear regression model.
 
 
  Regression can help finance and investment professionals. A company might use it to predict sales based on weather, previous sales, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or other types of conditions. The  capital asset pricing model (CAPM)  is a regression model that’s often used in finance for pricing assets and discovering the costs of capital.

Russell 2000 Index Definition and Key Metrics,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Russell 2000 Index?    
  The Russell 2000 Index is a stock market index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smaller companies included in the  Russell 3000 Index . The Russell 2000 is managed by London's  FTSE Russell Group , widely regarded as a  bellwether  of the U.S. economy because of its focus on smaller companies in the U.S. market. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Russell 2000 index is a market index composed of 2,000 small-cap companies. The index was launched in 1984 by the Frank Russell Company and is now managed by FTSE Russell. The index is frequently used as a benchmark for measuring the performance of small-cap mutual funds. Many investors see the index's breadth as giving it an edge over narrower indexes of small-cap stocks. Investors can replicate the returns of the Russell 2000 Index by investing in a fund that tracks the index. 
 
    Understanding the Russell 2000 Index    
  The Russell 2000 Index was launched in 1984 by the Frank Russell Company. It is a U.S. index managed by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the  London Stock Exchange (LSE)  Group. The index is composed of about 2,000 small-cap companies. 1 
 
 
  The index is the most widely quoted measure of the overall performance of small-cap to  mid-cap  stocks. It represents approximately 7% of the total Russell 3000  market capitalization  and is made up of the bottom two-thirds in terms of company size of the Russell 3000 index. The larger index reflects the movements of nearly 96% of all publicly traded U.S. stocks. 2 1 
 
 
  As of FTSE Russel's index factsheet dated March 31, 2024, the index's top three holdings were Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), Microstrategy ( MSTR ), and Comfort Systems USA ( FIX ). It is highest weighted in industrials, followed by healthcare, then financials. 1  The table below highlights a breakdown of the index by industry. 1

   Mutual fund  investors favor the Russell 2000 Index because it reflects the investment opportunity presented by the entire  market  rather than opportunities offered by narrower indices, which may contain bias or more stock-specific risk that can distort a fund manager's performance. It's no surprise that many funds and  exchange-traded funds (ETFs)  mirror or are based on the Russell 2000.
 
 
   Important 
 Many investors compare  small-cap  mutual funds' movements against the index's movement. That's because the index's movement is seen as a reflection of the opportunities in that entire sub-section of the market rather than narrower indices, which may contain biases or more stock-specific risks that can distort performance. 
 
 
 
    Key Metrics of the Russell 2000 Index    
  As of March 31, 2024, the average  value  for a company on the Russell 2000 was $4.82 billion, while the median market cap was $960 million. The largest stock by market cap on the index was $58.43 billion. 1  The Russell 2000 first traded above 1,000 on May 20, 2013. 3 
 
 
  Two sub-indexes of the Russell 2000 have been created to track the performance of companies within it that contain unique characteristics that are desired by certain types of investors:
 
 
 
 The   Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of Russell 2000 companies with higher price-to-value ratios and higher forecasted growth values. 4 
 The Russell 2000 Value Index measures the performance of Russell 2000 companies with lower  price-to-book (P/B) ratios  and lower forecasted growth values. 5 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The smallest 1,000 companies in the Russell 2000 make up the Russell  1000 Microcap Index . 6  The Russell 2000 is itself composed of the two-thousand smallest companies in the broader Russell 3000 Index. 4 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  The Russell 2000 Index is weighted using a combination of market cap and the other indexes a stock is listed on. This means that a member stock's last sale price, the number of shares that can be traded, and whether it is on other indexes influence its listing on the index.
 
 
  The other big difference between the Russell 2000 and other major indices is that it tracks small-cap stocks. The S&P 500 and  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  indices, on the other hand, track large-cap stocks.
 
 
  The index's returns can be","By

Fourth World: Definition and History of The Term,"Close 
 
 
 
    What is the Fourth World?    
  The Fourth World is an outdated term used to describe the most underdeveloped, poverty-stricken, and marginalized regions of the world.
 
 
  Many inhabitants of these nations do not have any political ties and are often hunter-gatherers that live in nomadic communities, or are part of tribes. They may be fully functional and self-surviving but during the Cold War were ascribed Fourth World status based on their economic performance. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Fourth World refers to the most underdeveloped, poverty-stricken, and marginalized regions and populations of the world. Many inhabitants of these nations do not have any political ties and are often hunter-gatherers that live in nomadic communities, or are part of tribes. The outdated and offensive term Fourth World is often linked to indigenous people. 1 
 
    Understanding Fourth World    
  During the Cold War, each country was classed as belonging to a certain type of world, a position that has since evolved as these classifications have evolved. The First World was used to describe countries whose views aligned with NATO and  capitalism , the  Second World  referred to countries that supported  communism  and the Soviet Union and the Third World referenced the nations that were not actively aligned with either side. These countries included impoverished former European colonies and all the nations of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.
 
 
  The term Fourth World was born later as an extension of the developing Third World to describe places and populations characterized by extremely low  income per capita  and limited natural resources. 1 
 
 
  Fourth World nations consisted of those excluded from mainstream society. For example, the Aboriginal tribes in South America or Australia are entirely self-sufficient but do not participate in the global  economy . These tribes can function free from any assistance from others but, from a global standpoint, were considered to be Fourth World nations. Fourth World nations do not contribute or consume anything on the global scale and are unaffected by any global events.
 
 
  Political borders did not define Fourth World areas. In many cases, they were defined as nations without sovereign status, emphasizing instead the perceived non-recognition and exclusion of ethnically and religiously defined peoples from the politico-economic world system, such as the First Nations groups throughout North, Central, and South America. 2 
 
 
 
 
    History of the Fourth World Term    
  The term Fourth World was believed to have been first used in Canada by Mbuto Milando, the first secretary of the Tanzanian High Commission, in a conversation with George Manuel, Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations). Milando stated that ""When native peoples come into their own, on the basis of their own cultures and traditions, that will be the Fourth World.""
 
 
  The term became synonymous with stateless, poor, and marginal nations following the publication of Manuel's  The Fourth World: An Indian Reality  in 1974. 3  Since 1979, think tanks, such as the Center for World Indigenous Studies, have used the term to define the relationships between ancient, tribal, and non-industrial nations and modern political nation-states. 4 
 
 
  In 2007, the  United Nations  (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was introduced to promote ""minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world.” 5  Since then, communications and organizing among Fourth World peoples accelerated in the form of international treaties for  trade , travel, and security.

What Is Value-Added Tax (VAT)?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Value-Added Tax (VAT)?    
  The term value-added tax (VAT) refers to a  consumption tax  on goods and services levied at each stage of the  supply chain  where value is added. As such, a VAT is added from the initial production of goods and services to the point of sale. The amount of VAT the user pays is based on the cost of the product minus any costs of materials that were taxed at a previous stage. Value-added tax rates vary. Not all countries impose a VAT on goods and services, including the United States.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Value-added tax is added to a product at every point of the supply chain where value is added to it. Advocates claim that VATs raise government revenues without punishing the wealthy by charging them more through an income tax. VAT critics say the tax places an undue economic burden on lower-income taxpayers. The U.S. does not have a VAT even though many industrialized countries do. 
 
    Understanding Value-Added Taxes (VATs)    
  As noted above, a value-added tax is a tax that is added to goods and services at every level of the supply chain. The tax is usually passed on to the consumer or end-user. It is based on consumption rather than income. In contrast to a  progressive  income tax, which levies more taxes on the wealthy, VAT is charged equally on every purchase. More than 160 countries use a VAT system. It is most commonly found in the  European Union (EU) . 1 
 
 
  VAT is levied on the  gross margin  at each point in the process of manufacturing, distributing, and selling an item. The tax is assessed and collected at each stage. That is different from a sales tax system, in which the tax is assessed and paid only by the consumer at the very end of the supply chain. 1 
 
 
  Let's say a candy called Dulce is manufactured and sold in the imaginary country of Alexia. Alexia has a 10% VAT. Here is how the tax would work:
 
 
   Dulce’s manufacturer buys the raw materials for $2, plus a VAT of 20 cents for a total price of $2.20. This is payable to the government of Alexia. The manufacturer sells Dulce to a retailer for $5 plus a VAT of 50 cents, for a total of $5.50. The manufacturer pays only 30 cents to Alexia, which is the total VAT at this point, minus the prior VAT charged by the raw material supplier. Note that the 30 cents also equal 10% of the manufacturer’s gross margin of $3.  A retailer sells Dulce to consumers for $10 plus a VAT of $1, for a total of $11. The retailer pays the government of Alexia 50 cents, which is the total VAT at this point ($1 - 50 cents VAT charged by the manufacturer). The 50 cents also represent 10% of the retailer’s gross margin on Dulce.

  Advocates say VAT raises government revenues without charging wealthy taxpayers more, as  income taxes  do. It is also considered simpler and more standardized than a traditional  sales tax , with fewer compliance issues. Critics, on the other hand, argue that VAT is a  regressive tax  that places an undue economic burden on lower-income consumers while increasing the bureaucratic burden on businesses. 2 3 
 
 
 
 
    History of Value-Added Taxes    
  The idea of a value-added tax was a largely European creation. It was introduced by French tax authority Maurice Lauré in 1954, although the idea of taxing each stage of the production process was said to have first been floated a century earlier in Germany. 4 
 
 
  The vast majority of industrialized countries that make up the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  have a VAT system. The United States remains a notable exception. 1 
 
 
  According to an  International Monetary Fund (IMF)  study, any nation that switches to VAT initially feels the negative impact of reduced tax revenues. In the long run, however, the study concluded that VAT adoption has in the majority of cases increased government revenue and proved effective. 5 
 
 
  VAT has a negative connotation in parts of the world, even hurting its proponents politically. For example, Filipino lawmaker Ralph Recto (a chief proponent of VAT in the early 2000s) was voted out of office by the electorate when he ran for reelection. 6 7  However, the population eventually accepted the tax in the years after it was implemented. Recto was eventually reelected, becoming a proponent of an expanded VAT. 
 
 
   Important 
 VAT is often broken down into a standard rate and a reduced rate, where the latter is usually applied to goods and services deemed necessities. 8

"Underwriter in Finance: What Do They Do, What Are Different Types?","What Is an Underwriter?    
  An underwriter is any party, usually a member of a financial organization, that evaluates and assumes another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments for a fee, usually in the form of a commission, premium, spread, or interest.
 
 
  Underwriters try to determine the likelihood that a borrower will pay as promised and that enough  collateral  is available if there's a  default . In the case of insurance, underwriters seek to assess a policyholder's health and other factors and spread the potential risk among as many people as possible. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An underwriter is any party, usually a member of a financial organization, that evaluates and assumes, for a fee, another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments. Underwriters work in many areas of finance, from the insurance industry to mortgage lending. Underwriters determine the level of risk for lenders. Underwriters are critical to the mortgage industry, insurance industry, equity markets, and common types of debt securities trading because of their ability to ascertain risk. A book runner is another name for a lead underwriter. 
 
    What Do Underwriters Do?    
   Underwriters  play a critical role in many industries in the financial world, including the mortgage industry, the insurance industry, equity markets, and some common types of debt securities trading. An individual in the position of a lead underwriter is sometimes called a  book runner .
 
 
  Modern-day underwriters play a variety of roles, depending on the industry in which they work. In general, underwriters are tasked with determining the level of  risk  involved in a transaction or other kind of business decision. Risk is the likelihood that an outcome or investment’s actual gains will differ from an expected outcome or  return .
 
 
  Investors rely on underwriters because they determine if a business risk is worth taking. Underwriters also contribute to sales-type activities. For example, in an  initial public offering (IPO) , the underwriter might purchase the entire IPO issue and sell it to investors. An IPO is a process through which a previously privately owned company sells its  shares  on a public stock exchange for the first time. 1 
 
 
 
 
    History of Underwriters    
  The term “underwriter” first emerged in the early days of marine insurance. Shipowners sought insurance for a ship and its cargo to protect themselves if the boat and its contents were lost. Shipowners would prepare a document that described their ship and its contents, crew, and destination.
 
 
  An agreed-upon rate and terms were set out in the paper. Businesspeople who wished to assume some obligation or risk would sign their name at the bottom and indicate how much exposure they were willing to accept. These businesspeople became known as underwriters. 2 
 
 
    Types of Underwriters    
    Mortgage Underwriters    
  The most common type of underwriter is a mortgage loan underwriter. Mortgage loans are approved based on a combination of an applicant’s income, credit history, debt ratios, and overall savings. 3 
 
 
  Mortgage loan underwriters ensure that a loan applicant meets all of these requirements, and they subsequently approve or deny a loan. Underwriters also review a property’s appraisal to ensure that it is accurate and that the home is worth the  purchase price  and loan amount.
 
 
  Mortgage loan underwriters have final approval for all mortgage loans. Loans that aren't approved can go through an appeal process, but the decision requires overwhelming evidence to be overturned.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of insurance underwriters is projected to decline 4% from 2021 to 2031. 4   
 
 
 
    Insurance Underwriters    
  Insurance underwriters, like mortgage underwriters, review applications for coverage and accept or reject an applicant based on risk analysis. Insurance brokers and other entities submit insurance applications on behalf of clients, and insurance underwriters review the application and decide whether to offer insurance coverage.

Earnest Money: Definition and How It Works in Real Estate,"Definition 
 In real estate, earnest money is a deposit paid by a buyer to demonstrate that they are serious about buying a property. 
    What Is Earnest Money?    
  Earnest money is a deposit paid by a buyer to a seller to demonstrate a good-faith intention to make a purchase, such as for a new home. In many ways, earnest money can be considered a deposit on a home, an escrow deposit, or  good faith money .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Earnest money is a deposit that a buyer makes on a home they want to purchase. A contract is written up during the exchange of the earnest money that outlines the conditions for refunding the amount. Earnest money deposits can be anywhere from 1–10% of the sales price, depending mostly on market interest. Should a buyer break the terms of the contract, they may be at risk of losing their earnest money deposit. Some contingencies allow the buyer to back out of a deal while keeping all of their earnest money. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Ellen Lindner 
 
    Understanding Earnest Money    
  In most cases, earnest money is delivered when the sales contract or purchase agreement is signed, but it can also be attached to the offer. Once deposited, the funds are typically held in an  escrow  account until closing, when the deposit will be applied to the buyer's down payment and closing costs. The money gives the buyer extra time to get financing and conduct the title search, property appraisal, and inspections before closing.
 
 
  When a buyer decides to purchase a home from a seller, both parties enter into a contract. The contract doesn't require the buyer to purchase the home, in case the  home appraisal  and inspection later reveal problems with the house. The contract does, however, ensure the seller takes the house off the market while it's inspected and appraised. To demonstrate that they are serious about buying the property, the buyer makes an earnest money deposit (EMD).
 
 
  The buyer might be able to reclaim the earnest money deposit if something that was specified ahead of time in the contract goes wrong. For instance, the earnest money would be returned if the house doesn't appraise for the sales price or the inspection reveals a serious defect—provided these contingencies are listed in the contract. 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Earnest money is returned to the buyer if the seller terminates the deal, but it is awarded to the seller if the buyer unreasonably terminates the deal. 
 
 
 
    How Much Are the Earnest Money Amounts?    
  Buyers and sellers negotiate the amount of earnest money required, but it often ranges between 1% and 2% of the home's purchase price, depending on the market. In hot housing markets, the deposit might go as high as 5% or 10% of a property's sale price.
 
 
  While the earnest money deposit is often a percentage of the sales price, some sellers prefer a fixed amount, such as $5,000 or $10,000. Of course, the higher the earnest money amount, the more serious the seller is likely to consider the buyer. Therefore, a buyer should offer a high enough earnest deposit to be accepted, but not one so high as to put extra money at risk.
 
 
  A seller may also require ongoing, periodic earnest deposits to have a prospective buyer continue to show good faith during their due diligence process. For example, a seller may require a buyer to make monthly earnest deposits on a fixed schedule over a three-month due diligence period. Should the buyer fail to meet any earnest money deposit requirements, the seller may be entitled to bring the property back to market and potentially recover their losses by keeping portions of the earnest money. 
 
 
    How Is Earnest Money Paid?    
  Earnest money is usually paid by certified check, personal check, or wire transfer into a trust or escrow account held by a real estate brokerage, legal firm, or title company. The funds are held in the account until closing, when they are applied toward the buyer's down payment and closing costs.
 
 
  It's important to note that an escrow account, like any other bank account, can earn interest. If the earnest funds in the escrow account earn interest of more than $600, the buyer must fill out tax  form W-9  with the IRS to receive the interest. 1 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Different jurisdictions may have different legal circumstances around earnest money. For example, Washington state legislature stipulates slightly different definitions than Minnesota statutes. 2 3 
 
 
 
    Is Earnest Money Refundable?    
  Earnest money isn't always refunded if a deal falls through. The good news for buyers is that as long as they don't break any contract agreements or miss any deadlines, they can get their earnest money back. Some conditions where buyers can get their earnest money back include:
 
 
   If a home inspection reveals material issues with a property being sold. The buyer can usually negotiate who is responsible for the repairs or can back out of the purchase.

Z-Score: Meaning and Formula,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Z-Score?    
  Z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. In investing and trading, Z-scores are measures of an instrument's variability and can be used by traders to help determine volatility.
 
 
   Key Takeaways  
 A Z-Score is a statistical measurement of a score's relationship to the mean in a group of scores. A Z-score can reveal to a trader if a value is typical for a specified data set or if it is atypical. In general, a Z-score of -3.0 to 3.0 suggests that a stock is trading within three standard deviations of its mean. Traders have developed many methods that use z-score to identify correlations between trades, trading positions, and evaluate trading strategies. 
 
    Understanding Z-Score    
  Z-score is a statistical measure that quantifies the distance between a data point and the mean of a dataset. It's expressed in terms of standard deviations. It indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the distribution.
 
 
  If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean. 1 
 
 
  The Z-score is sometimes confused with the Altman Z-score, which is calculated using factors taken from a company's financial reports. The  Altman Z-score  is used to calculate the likelihood that a business will go bankrupt within the range of one to 10 years, while the Z-score can be used to determine how far a stock's return differs from it's average return—and much more. 2 3 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Z-score is also known as the standard score. 
 
 
 
    Z-Score Formula    
  The statistical formula for a value's z-score is calculated using the following formula:

  z = ( x - μ ) / σ
 
 
  Where:
 
 
   z = Z-score x = the value being evaluated μ = the mean σ = the standard deviation 
 
 
    How to Calculate Z-Score    
    Z-Score    
  Calculating a z-score requires that you first determine the  mean  and  standard deviation  of your data. 1  Once you have these figures, you can calculate your z-score. So, assume you have the following variables:
 
 
   x = 57 μ = 52 σ = 4 
 
 
  You would use the variables in the formula:
 
 
   z = ( 57 - 52 ) / 4 z = 1.25 
 
 
  So, your selected value has a z-score that indicates it is 1.25 standard deviations from the mean. 
 
 
    Spreadsheets    
  To determine z-score using a spreadsheet, you'll need to input your values and determine the average for the range and the standard deviation. Using the formulas:
 
 
  =AVERAGE(A2:A7)
 
 
  =STDEV(A2:A7)
 
 
  You'll find that the following values have a mean of 12.17 and a standard deviation of 6.4.

    How the Z-Score Is Used    
  In it's most basic form, the z-score allows you determine how far (measured in standard deviations) the returns for the stock you're evaluating are from the mean of a sample of stocks. The average score you have could be the mean of a stock's annual return, the average return of the index it is listed on, or the average return of a selection of stocks you've picked.
 
 
  Some traders use the z-scores in more advanced evaluation methods, such as weighting each stock's return to use  factor investing , where stocks are evaluated based on specific attributes using z-scores and standard deviation. In the forex markets, traders use z-scores and confidence limits to test the capability of a trading system to generate winning and losing streaks.

Economies of Scale: What Are They and How Are They Used?,"Definition 
 Economies of scale are cost advantages companies gain through efficient, increased production. 
    What Are Economies of Scale?    
  Economies of scale represent the potential benefits of having a larger operation. In theory, larger operations are able to increase production, buy higher quantities of goods in bulk, and rely on process efficiencies. When these benefits are captured, it is said that a company is capitalizing on economies of scale as it is accomplishing more efficient use of resources due to its size. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Economies of scale are cost savings that companies experience when production becomes efficient, often by being larger. This occurs when production rises at a rate faster than costs, with costs then being spread over a larger amount of goods. A business's size is related to whether it can achieve an economy of scale—larger companies will have more cost savings and higher production levels. Economies of scale can be both internal and external; internal economies are caused by factors within a single company, while external factors affect the entire industry. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Mira Norian 
 
    Understanding Economies of Scale    
  The size of the business generally matters when it comes to economies of scale. The larger the business, the greater its  cost savings . Economies of scale can be both internal and external. Internal economies of scale are based on management decisions, while external ones have to do with outside factors.
 
 
  Internal functions include accounting, information technology, and marketing, which are also considered operational efficiencies and synergies.
 
 
  Economies of scale are an important concept for any business in any industry and represent the cost-savings and competitive advantages larger businesses have over smaller ones.
 
 
  Most consumers don't understand why a smaller business charges more for a similar product sold by a larger company. That's because the cost per unit depends on how much the company produces.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 A company can create a diseconomy of scale when it becomes too large and chases an economy of scale. 
 
 
 
  Larger companies can produce more by spreading the cost of production over a larger amount of goods. An industry may also be able to dictate the cost of a product if several different companies are producing similar goods within that industry.
 
 
  There are several reasons why economies of scale give rise to  lower per-unit costs . First, specialization of  labor  and more integrated technology boost production volumes.
 
 
  Second, lower per-unit costs can come from bulk orders from suppliers, larger advertising buys, or lower  costs of capital . Third, spreading internal function costs across more units produced and sold helps to reduce costs.
 
 
    Internal vs. External Economies of Scale    
  As mentioned above, there are two different  types of economies of scale .
 
 
   Internal economies of scale : Originate within the company, due to changes in how that company functions or produces goods External economies of scale : Based on factors that affect the entire industry, rather than a single company 
 
 
    Internal Economies of Scale    
  Internal economies of scale happen when a company cuts costs internally, so they're unique to that particular firm. This may be the result of the sheer size of a company or because of decisions from the firm's management. There are different kinds of internal economies of scale. These include:
 
 
   Technical : large-scale machines or production processes that increase productivity Purchasing : discounts on cost due to purchasing in bulk Managerial : employing specialists to oversee and improve different parts of the production process Risk-Bearing : spreading risks out across multiple investors Financial : higher creditworthiness, which increases access to capital and more favorable interest rates Marketing : more advertising power spread out across a larger market, as well as a position in the market to negotiate 
 
 
  Larger companies are often able to achieve internal economies of scale—lowering their costs and raising their production levels—because they can, for example, buy resources in bulk, have a patent or special technology, or access more capital.
 
 
    External Economies of Scale    
  External economies of scale, on the other hand, are achieved because of external factors, or factors that affect an entire industry. That means no one company  controls costs  on its own. These occur when there is a highly skilled labor pool, subsidies and/or tax reductions, and partnerships and joint ventures—anything that can cut down on costs to many companies in a specific industry.
 
 
    Overcoming Limits    
  Management techniques and technology have been focusing on overcoming the limits to economies of scale for decades.
 
 
  Set-up costs are lower due to more flexible technology. Equipment is priced","By

    What Operations Managers Do    
  Operations managers coordinate new processes while reevaluating current structures. Organization and  productivity  are two key drivers, and the work often requires versatility and innovation. They may determine the size of manufacturing plants or implement the structure of information technology networks.
 
 
  Operations managers may oversee inventory management processes,  work-in-process  levels,  raw materials  acquisition,  quality control , materials handling, and maintenance policies. As part of their daily responsibilities, operations managers must possess a variety of skill sets, including: 1 
 
 
   Technical expertise  in production automation, data entry, budget tracking, and design Organizational ability  to track project files, employee reports, budgets, schedules, and other details related to company processes Motivational prowess  in the form of strong leadership skills that provide the expertise to motivate others, inspire ideas, and foster a supportive and diverse team Analytical aptitude , including risk analysis and mitigation when initiating new projects. Operations managers must analyze processes to identify challenges and offer solutions. Decision-making proficiency , especially under stress, when there is very little time to assess all factors Maintain quality standards , including raw materials, machinery, manufacturing procedures, packaging, delivery processes, and the finished product. 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 The daily activities of a company to produce and sell a product and generate revenue are its  operating activities . 
 
 
 
    Operations Management Tools    
 
 Business Process Reengineering (BPR) : Focused on analyzing and designing  workflow  and business processes within a company. BPR seeks to optimize processes and eliminate redundancies.  BPR  (also known as business process redesign) helps companies dramatically restructure the organization by designing the business process from the ground up. 2 
 Six Sigma : Introduced by Bill Smith at Motorola in 1986 to improve manufacturing quality. The term “six” references the control limits at six  standard deviations  from the normal distribution mean. Tools used within the  Six Sigma  process include trending charts, potential defect calculations, and other ratios. 3 
 Lean Manufacturing : Aims to reduce waste and improve continuity in  supply chain  management. Lean manufacturing targets the flow of products from the production stage to customer delivery. 4 
 
 
    Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSCM)    
  A critical function of operations management relates to  inventory  flow through the supply chain. 5  This process is known as operations and supply chain management (OSCM). Operations management professionals understand  logistics , global trends, customer demand, and available resources for production.
 
 
  Operations management approaches the acquisition of materials and the use of labor in a timely, cost-effective manner to deliver customer expectations. Inventory levels are monitored to ensure that ample quantities are on hand. Operations managers find vendors that supply the appropriate goods at reasonable prices and that deliver the product when needed.
 
 
  Operations managers use numerous formulas, such as the  economic order quantity  formula, to determine how large an inventory order to process and how much inventory to hold on hand. Managers may follow up with customers to ensure products meet quality and functionality needs. Operations managers take feedback and distribute relevant information to each department for improvement.
 
 
   What Is the Purpose of Operations Management? 
 Operations management (OM) evaluates the production process and business operations and creates an efficient outcome. OM professionals balance operating costs with revenue to maximize net operating profit.

 Definition 
 A 401(k) plan is a  tax-advantaged  retirement savings plan. 
    What Is a 401(k) Plan?    
  Named after a section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) is a  defined-contribution plan  provided by an employer. 1  The employer may match employee contributions; with some plans, the match is mandatory.
 
 
  There are two major types of 401(k)s: traditional and  Roth . With a traditional 401(k), employee contributions are  pretax , meaning they reduce taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. But with a Roth 401(k), employee contributions are made with after-tax income. There’s no tax deduction in the contribution year, but withdrawals—qualified distributions—are tax free. 2 
 
 
  Below, you'll find detailed information on how 401(k) plans work, how to start one, and strategies for making the most of a plan.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A 401(k) plan is a company-sponsored retirement account in which employees can contribute a percentage of their income. Employers often offer to match at least some of these contributions. There are two basic types of 401(k)s—traditional and Roth—which differ primarily in how they’re taxed. Employer contributions can be made to both traditional and Roth 401(k) plans. There are rules governing when you can withdraw money from a 401(k) without penalty. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Ellen Lindner / Investopedia 
 
  “The most important thing to know when making any decision about your 401(k) is to use it. In a perfect world, you put the maximum amount in it,  but at a minimum , you should contribute up to the point where your company matches what you put in,” said  Peter Lazaroff , financial advisor and chief investment officer at Plancorp.
 
 
  In 2023 (the most recent data), Americans saved an average of 7.1% of their salaries in their 401(k)s, which was higher than the overall personal savings rate that year. 3 4  Less than 12% of working-age Americans were on track in 2023 to max out their contributions. 5  The  401(k) employee contribution limit  for 2025 is $31,000 (including  “catch-up” contributions ) for those 50 and older and $23,500 for those under 50 (the limits in 2024 are $30,500 and $23,000, respectively). 6

    How 401(k)s Work    
  Traditional 401(k) plans were introduced in the early 1980s, allowing employees to make pretax contributions from their salaries up to certain limits. 7 8 
 
 
  When a worker signs up for a 401(k), they agree to deposit a percentage of each paycheck directly into an investment account. Employers often match part or all of that contribution.
 
 
  Employees choose the specific investments held within their 401(k) accounts from a selection offered by their employer. Typically, investment offerings include stock and bond  mutual funds  and  target-date funds  designed to reduce the risk of losses as the employee approaches retirement. 9 
 
 
   Note 
 An employee’s account holdings may include guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer’s own stock. 10 
 
    How Do You Start a 401(k)?    
 
 Contact your employer. Ask if a 401(k) is available, and whether there is a company match. 
 If a 401(k) is available, the company will instruct you how to sign up with new paperwork.

"Trade Line: Definition, How It Works, and Included Records","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Trade Line?    
  A trade line is a record of activity for any credit extended to a borrower and  reported to a credit reporting agency  such as Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. A trade line is established on a borrower’s credit report when a borrower is approved for credit. The trade line records all of the activity associated with an account.
 
 
  Credit reporting agencies use trade lines to calculate a borrower’s credit score. Different credit reporting agencies give differing weights to the activities of trade lines when establishing a credit score for borrowers.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A trade line is created on a borrower’s credit report to track all account activity. A trade line is created for every line of credit or account a debtor has, such as a mortgage, car loan, student loan, credit card, or personal loan. Trade lines include information on the creditor, the lender, and the type of credit given. A closed credit account will generally remain on a trade line for seven to 10 years. A trade line includes all relevant information used to determine your credit score, so it is important to review it to ensure all information is valid and error-free. 
 
    How a Trade Line Works    
  A trade line is an important record-keeping mechanism that tracks borrowers' activity on their  credit reports . Each credit account has its own trade line. Borrowers will have multiple trade lines on their credit report, each representing the individual borrowing accounts for which they have been approved.
 
 
  The basic types of accounts with a trade line are those paid off in fixed installments, which are often broken into categories. First, revolving trade lines are reported on credit cards or other lines of credit. Second, installment trade lines report the history of car loans, mortgages, student loans, and personal loans. Open accounts, a third type of account on a trade line, are often associated with businesses rather than individuals. 1 
 
 
   Tip 
 Should a trade line be created in your name fraudulently, you can contact the credit reporting agencies to request the removal of that trade line from your credit history. 
 
 
 
    Records Included in a Trade Line    
  Trade lines may contain various data points related to the creditor, the lender, and the type of credit being provided. The trade line often includes the name of the creditor or lender, the account or another identifier for the type of credit being provided, the parties responsible for paying the loan, and the account's payment status.
 
 
 
 
  The trade line will also contain particular account milestones, such as the date the credit was extended, the credit limit, the payment history, all delinquency levels if any missed payments have occurred, and the total amount owed as of the last report. If a consumer closes an account, that account will typically remain on their credit report as a trade line for up to 10 years, though the account can sometimes go away sooner. 2 
 
 
  Payment status indicates whether or not loan payments are being made on time and how late they are if they are not. If the payments are being made on time, the status will indicate that they are being made according to the terms of the credit agreement.
 
 
   Important 
 The information included in your trade lines is used to calculate your credit scores. While your credit score is a summarized snapshot of your creditworthiness, lenders may request to see a detailed report of your entire trade line. 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Late payments are usually grouped in a range of days according to how late they are. For example, delinquencies may be reported as 30 days late, 60 days late, or 90 days late. The payment status may be set to “ charge off ” if the creditor deems it unlikely that the debt will be repaid, and the status may also indicate that the credit recipient has entered bankruptcy.
 
 
  Credit reporting agencies use trade lines to develop an individual’s credit score, so credit scores vary. Higher scores are generally given to individuals with more favorable trade line reporting. Factors considered when calculating the credit score include the number of trade lines, types of trade lines, lengths of open accounts, and payment history.
 
 
  Lenders may analyze a prospective borrower's trade line reporting and credit score when considering their credit application during the underwriting process.
 
 
    FICO Credit Score    
  When applying for credit, your lender will often request your credit score as part of the approval process. Your FICO score is directly determined from the information listed on each trade line. Below is  how your FICO score is calculated  and how each section relates to trade lines. 3 
 
 
   Payment History (35%):  Trade lines include debt or lines of credit that have been closed for up to 10 years. Amounts Owed (30%):  Trade lines are created for every line of credit. Each line of credit, revolving","By

"Futures Trading: What It Is, How It Works, Factors, and Pros & Cons","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Futures are an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a set date in the future. 
    What Is Futures Trading?    
  Futures are contracts to buy or sell a specific underlying asset at a future date. The underlying asset can be a commodity, a security, or another financial instrument. Futures trading requires the buyer to purchase or the seller to sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the market price, at the expiration date.
 
 
  Futures trading commonly refers to futures whose underlying assets are securities in the stock market. These contracts are based on the future value of an individual company’s shares or a stock market index like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Nasdaq. 1   Futures trading on exchanges  like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange can include underlying “assets” like physical commodities, bonds, or weather events. 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Futures are derivatives, which are financial contracts whose value comes from changes in the price of the underlying asset. Stock market futures trading obligates the buyer to purchase or the seller to sell a stock or set of stocks at a predetermined future date and price. Futures hedge the price moves of a company’s shares, a set of stocks, or an index to help prevent losses from unfavorable price changes. 
 
    How Futures Trading Works    
  Futures contracts are standardized by quantity, quality, and asset delivery, making trading them on futures exchanges possible. They bind the buyer to purchasing and the other party to selling a stock or shares in an index at a previously fixed date and price. 3  This ensures market transparency, enhances liquidity, and  aids in accurate prices .
 
 
  Stock futures have specific expiration dates and are organized by month. For example, futures for a major index like the S&P 500 might have contracts expiring in March, June, September, and December. 4  The contract with the nearest expiration date is known as the “front-month” contract, which often has the most trading activity. As a contract nears expiration, traders who want to maintain a position typically roll over to the next available contract month. Short-term traders often work with front-month contracts, while long-term investors might look further out. 1 
 
 
 
 
  When trading  index futures  such as those of the S&P 500, traders may buy a futures contract, agreeing to purchase shares in the index at a set price six months from now. If the index goes up, the value of the futures contract will increase, and they can sell the contract at a profit before the expiration date. Selling futures works the other way around. If traders believe a specific equity is due for a fall and sell a futures contract, and the market declines as expected, traders can buy back the contract at a lower price, profiting from the difference.

   Tip 
 When settling a futures contract, the method depends on the asset. Physical delivery is standard for commodities like oil, gold, or wheat. However, for futures contracts based on stocks and stock indexes, the settlement method is cash. 1 
 
 
 
    Underlying Assets    
  Futures traders can lock in the price of the underlying asset. These contracts have  expiration  dates and set prices that are known upfront. Stock futures have specific expiration dates and are organized by month. The underlying assets in futures contracts may include: 5 
 
 
 
 Commodity futures with underlying commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, corn, and wheat 
 Cryptocurrency futures  are based on moves in assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum 
 Currency futures, including those for the euro and the British pound 
 Energy futures, with underlying assets that include crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil 
 Equities futures, which are based on stocks and groups of stocks traded in the market 
 Interest rate futures, which speculate or hedge Treasurys and other bonds against future changes in interest rates 
 Precious metal futures for gold and silver 
 Stock index futures with underlying assets such as the S&P 500 Index 
 
 
   Important 
 The buyer of a futures contract must take possession of the underlying stocks or shares at the time of expiration and not before. Buyers of futures contracts may sell their positions before expiration. There is a  difference between options and futures . American-style options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset anytime before the expiration date of the contract. 6

 Definition 
 Present value, an estimate of the current value of a future sum of money, is calculated by investors to compare the probable benefits of various investment choices. 
    What Is Present Value?    
  Calculating present value allows an investor to compare the potential performance of various investments by determining the current worth of the number of dollars that each investment will return by a future date.
 
 
  Present value (PV) is based on the concept that a sum of money in hand today is probably worth more than the same sum in the future because it can be invested and earn a return in the meantime. 
 
 
  Present value (PV) is calculated by discounting the future value by the estimated  rate of return  that the money could earn if invested.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Present value calculations are used to make investing decisions and to inform strategic planning decisions by businesses. A present value calculation requires an estimate of the potential rate of return, known as the discount rate. The discount rate can only be estimated, so if it is inaccurate, the present value calculation will be off as well. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Katie Kerpel / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Present Value    
  Present value is based on the concept that a particular sum of money today is likely to be worth more than the same amount in the future. This is also known as the  time value of money . Based on the same logic, a sum of money that will be received at a future date will not be worth as much as that same sum today.
 
 
  For example, $1,000 in hand today should be worth more than $1,000 five years from now because it can be invested for those five years and earn a return. If, let's say, the $1,000 earns 5% a year, compounded annually, it will be worth about $1,276 in five years. 1

  Present value looks at it in reverse. For example, if you are due to receive $1,000 five years from now—the  future value  (FV)—what is that worth to you today? Using the same 5% interest rate compounded annually, the answer is about $784. 2 
 
 
 
 
  In this formulation, the rate of return is known as the  discount rate . The word ""discount"" refers to future value being discounted back to present value.
 
 
    Present Value Formula and Calculation    
  This is how to calculate the present value of a future sum of money: 
 Present Value = FV ( 1 + r ) n where: FV = Future Value r = Rate of return n = Number of periods \begin{aligned} &\text{Present Value} = \dfrac{\text{FV}}{(1+r)^n}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{FV} = \text{Future Value}\\ &r = \text{Rate of return}\\ &n = \text{Number of periods}\\ \end{aligned} ​ Present Value = ( 1 + r ) n FV ​ where: FV = Future Value r = Rate of return n = Number of periods ​ 
 
 Use the future amount that you expect to receive as the numerator of the formula. 
 Estimate the interest rate that you might earn between now and the future payment date if you were to invest the money today, and plug that in as a decimal for the ""r"" in the denominator. 
 Indicate the time period as the exponent ""n"" in the denominator. So, if you want to calculate the present value of an amount you expect to receive in three years, you would plug in the number 3.

 Definition 
 Bond yield is the annual interest that the holder of the bond will receive over its term to maturity. 
    What Is a Bond Yield?    
  A bond yield is the return on the capital invested by an investor. The yield matches the bond's coupon rate when the bond is issued, though the yield often changes while the bond is outstanding. Bond yields can be derived in different ways, including the coupon yield and current yield. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Bond yield is the return an investor realizes on an investment in a bond.   A bond can be purchased for more than its face value, at a premium, or less than its face value, at a discount. The current yield is the bond's coupon rate divided by its market price. Price and yield are inversely related and as the price of a bond goes up, its yield goes down.

    Understanding Bond Yields    
  Bonds are essentially a loan to bond  issuers . They are considered safe investments. That's because bond values don't change the same way stock prices do. They offer investors a reliable stream of income and provide bondholders with a fixed form of income.
 
 
  Investors earn interest on a bond throughout the life of the asset and receive the face value of the bond upon  maturity . Investors can purchase bonds for more than their face value at a premium or less than the face value at a discount. Whichever they buy will change the yield they earn on the bond.
 
 
  Bonds are rated by services approved by the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  and ratings range from ""AAA"" as investment grade with the lowest risk to ""D,"" which are bonds in default, or junk bonds, with the highest risk. 1 
 
 
  The return realized by a bond investor is called the yield. There are a couple of different yield-related concepts. These include the:

 Coupon Yield:  This is the annual interest rate established when the bond is issued. This figure remains the same for the lifetime of the bond. 
 Current Yield :  This figure depends on the bond's price and its coupon (or its  interest  payment). So if the price of the bond changes, the bond's yield also changes. 
 
 
    Formula and Calculation of a Bond Yield    
  The simplest way to  calculate a bond yield  is to divide its coupon payment by the face value of the bond. This is called the coupon rate. 2 
 Coupon Rate = Annual Coupon Payment Bond’s Current Market Price \begin{aligned}&\text{Coupon Rate}=\frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Bond's Current Market Price}}\end{aligned} ​ Coupon Rate = Bond’s Current Market Price Annual Coupon Payment ​ ​ 
 If a bond has a face value of $1,000 and made interest or coupon payments of $100 per year, then its coupon rate is 10% or $100 ÷ $1,000.Bonds are essentially a loan to bond  issuers . They are considered safe investments. That's because bond values don't change the same way stock prices do. They offer investors a reliable stream of income and provide bondholders with a fixed form of income. 
 
 
    Bond Yield vs. Bond Price    
  Price and yield are inversely related. This means that as the price of a bond goes up, its yield goes down. Conversely, as the yield goes up, the price of the bond goes down. 
 If an investor purchases a bond with a face value of $1000 that matures in five years with a 10% annual coupon rate, the bond pays 10%, or $100, in interest annually. If  interest rates  rise above 10%, the bond's price will fall if the investor decides to sell it. 3 
 If the interest rate for similar investments rises to 12%, the original bond will still earn a coupon payment of $100, which would be unattractive to investors who can buy bonds that pay $120 as interest rates have risen. To sell the original $1000 bond, the price can be lowered so that the coupon payments and maturity value equal a yield of 12%.

 Working capital is the difference between a company’s current assets and its short-term liabilities. 
    What Is Working Capital?    
  Working capital, also known as net working capital (NWC), is the amount of money a company has available to operate after deducting its current liabilities from its current assets. Current assets are items like cash, accounts receivable/customers’ unpaid bills, and inventories of raw materials and finished goods. Current liabilities are items such as accounts payable and debts.
 
 
  Working capital is a commonly used measurement to gauge the short-term financial health and efficiency of an organization.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Working capital measures a company’s liquidity and short-term financial health, indicating the ability to fund operations and respond to financial stress or opportunities. Negative working capital occurs when current liabilities exceed current assets, suggesting potential liquidity issues. Positive working capital shows a company can support ongoing operations and invest in future growth. High working capital isn’t always a good thing. It might indicate that a business has excess inventory, is not investing its excess cash, or is not taking advantage of low-cost debt opportunities. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Yurle Villegas 
 
    Understanding Working Capital    
  Working capital is calculated using the assets and liabilities listed on a corporation's balance sheet, with a focus on immediate debts and assets that can be converted to cash within a short period. Calculating working capital provides insight into a company's short-term liquidity. A company with positive working capital generally has the potential to invest in growth and expansion. But if current assets are exceeded by  current liabilities , the company has negative working capital and may face difficulties in growth, paying back creditors, or even avoiding bankruptcy. 
 
 
   Important 
 In corporate finance, ""current"" refers to a period of one year or less. Current assets are those that can be converted into cash within 12 months, while current liabilities are obligations that must be paid within the same timeframe. 1 
 
 
 
  The amount of working capital needed varies by industry, company size, and risk profile. Industries with longer production cycles require higher working capital due to slower inventory turnover. Alternatively, bigger retail companies interacting with numerous customers daily can generate short-term funds quickly and often need lower working capital. 
 
 
 
 
    Working Capital Formula    
  To calculate working capital, you subtract a company's current liabilities from its current assets. Both figures can be found in public companies' publicly disclosed financial statements. This information may not be readily available for private companies.

  Investing in stocks can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time. It involves buying shares in a company with the hope that the company will grow and perform well in the stock market for the long term, resulting in gains on your investment.
 
 
  It's important to start by setting clear investment goals, determining how much you can invest and how much risk you can tolerate. Then pick a  broker that matches your trading style , fund your account, and buy stocks.
 
 
  This beginner’s guide explains the essential steps to invest in stocks, whether you have thousands set aside or can invest a more modest $25 a week. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Investing in stocks and letting your money work for you is one way to grow your wealth. Investing involves a chance of losses. However, there are ways to lower your risk, though you can't eliminate it altogether. New investors have never had so many resources for expert advice. Following these seven essential steps, you’ll learn how to set clear investment goals, choose the right stocks, and understand the basics of stock investing. 
 
    How To Start Investing in Stocks in Just 7 Steps    
  Investing in stocks involves purchasing shares of ownership in a public company in the hopes of seeing the company perform well in the  stock market , leading to a share price increase that makes your investment more valuable.
 
 
  Investing in stocks can lead to positive financial returns if you own a stock that grows in value over time. But you also face the risk of losing money if a share price falls over time.
 
 
    Step 1: Set Clear Investment Goals    
  Begin by specifying your financial objectives. Clear goals will guide your investment decisions and help you stay focused. Consider both short-term and long-term goals, as they will affect your investment strategy.
 
 
  You might have short-term goals like saving for a home or a vacation or have long-term objectives like securing a comfortable retirement or funding a child’s education. Your objectives depend on your life stage and ambitions. Younger investors tend to focus more on growth and long-term wealth accumulation, while those closer to retirement typically prefer generating income and capital preservation. The more precise you are, the better.
 
 
 
 
    Tips for Setting Investment Goals:    
   Be specific about your objectives : Instead of vague goals like “save for retirement,” aim for specific targets like “accumulate $500,000 in my retirement fund by age 50.” Determine your investment horizon : Assess how long you have to achieve each goal. Longer time horizons often allow for more aggressive investment strategies, while shorter ones may require more conservative approaches. The longer you give yourself, the less conservative you'll need to be early on. Evaluate your finances : Be realistic about how much you can put toward your investment goals, considering your savings, regular income, and any other financial resources. Rank your goals : Most of us balance several goals at once, and we have to prioritize saving for a home down payment, paying for a wedding next year, or preparing for retirement based on urgency and importance. For example, saving for a down payment on a house might take precedence over planning a vacation. Adapt as life changes : The phrase financial planning is best taken as a verb, not a noun. It's an ongoing process that should evolve with your needs and aspirations. You might fall in love or out of it, have many children or none of them, or realize your life’s","0 seconds of 1 minute, 31 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

    What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio?    
  The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's  price-to-earnings  (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period.
 
 
  The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock's value while also factoring in the company's expected earnings growth. It provides a more complete picture than the standard P/E ratio.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding expected earnings growth into the calculation. The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator of a stock's true value. Similar to the P/E ratio, a lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. The PEG for a given company may differ significantly from one reported source to another. Differences will depend on which growth estimate is used in the calculation, such as one-year or three-year projected growth. A PEG lower than 1.0 is best, suggesting that a company is relatively undervalued. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin 
 
    How to Calculate the PEG Ratio    
   PEG Ratio = Price/EPS EPS Growth where: EPS = The earnings per share \begin{aligned} &\text{PEG Ratio}=\frac{\text{Price/EPS}}{\text{EPS Growth}}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{EPS = The earnings per share}\\ \end{aligned} ​ PEG Ratio = EPS Growth Price/EPS ​ where: EPS = The earnings per share ​ 
 To calculate the PEG ratio, you need to look up or calculate the P/E ratio of the company in question. The P/E ratio is calculated as the price per share of the company divided by the earnings per share (EPS), or price per share / EPS. 
 Once the P/E is calculated, find the expected growth rate for the stock in question, using analyst estimates available on financial websites that follow the  stock . Plug the figures into the equation, and solve for the PEG ratio number.
 
 
    Accuracy    
  As with any ratio, the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used. When considering a company's PEG ratio from a published source, it's important to find out which growth rate was used in the calculation.

  Using historical growth rates, for example, may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are expected to deviate from a company's historical growth. The ratio can be calculated using one-year, three-year, or five-year expected growth rates, for example. 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth, the terms ""forward PEG"" and ""trailing PEG"" are sometimes used. 
 
 
 
    What Does the PEG Ratio Tell You?    
  While a low  P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy , factoring in the company's growth rate to  get the stock's PEG ratio  may tell a different story. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock may be undervalued given its future earnings expectations. Adding a company's expected growth into the ratio helps to adjust the result for companies that may have a high growth rate and a high P/E ratio.
 
 
  The degree to which a PEG ratio result indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type. As a broad rule of thumb, some  investors  feel that a PEG ratio below one is desirable.

"Yield on Earning Assets: What it is, How it Works","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Yield on Earning Assets?    
  The yield on earning assets is a popular financial  solvency ratio  that compares a financial institution’s  interest income  to its earning assets. Yield on earning assets indicates how well assets are performing by looking at how much income they bring in.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Yield on earning assets is a financial solvency ratio that compares an entity's interest income to its earning assets. It is a measure of how much income assets are bringing in to the firm. A higher yield on earning assets is preferred and indicates that a company is using its assets efficiently. A high yield on earning assets also indicates that an entity is able to meet its short-term debt obligations and is not at risk of default or insolvency. Banks have to strike a balance between the number of loans offered, the rates charged, and the duration of the loans when compared to assets to achieve the right ratio levels. Increasing a low yield on earning assets would require a restructuring of an entity's pricing policy, approach to risk management, and investment strategy. 
 
    Understanding Yield on Earning Assets    
  Solvency ratios shed light on if a financial institution has the ability to stay in business by meeting its short-term obligations. The  yield  on earning assets is a way for regulators to determine how much money a financial institution is earning on its assets. Large cash yields are preferred, thereby indicating that a company can pay its short-term obligations and is not at risk of default or  insolvency .
 
 
  Banks and  financial institutions  that provide loans and other investment options that offer yields have to strike a balance between the different types of investment vehicles they offer, the interest rates charged, and the duration of those investments. These factors determine the amount of interest income a debt vehicle will bring in over a specific time frame. This interest income is then compared to the earning assets.
 
 
  Generally speaking, the higher a company’s  loan  to asset ratio, the higher its yield on returning assets. This is because the more loans made the more interest income earned or because higher-yielding  investment vehicles  bring in more income relative to the amount of money loaned out.
 
 
 
 
    High Yield vs. Low Yield    
  High yield on earning assets is an indicator that a company is bringing in a large amount of income from the loans and investments that it makes. This is often the result of good policies, such as ensuring that loans are appropriately priced, and investments are properly managed, as well as the company’s ability to garner a larger  share of the market .
 
 
  Financial institutions with a low yield on earning assets are at an increased risk of insolvency, which is the reason the yield on earning assets is of interest to regulators. A low ratio means that a company is providing loans that do not perform well since the amount of interest from those loans is approaching the value of the earning assets.
 
 
  Regulators may take this as an indicator that a company’s policies are creating a scenario in which the company will not be able to cover losses, and could thus become insolvent.
 
 
  As a measure of effectiveness, yield on earning assets can be useful for comparing different managers relative to their asset bases. Managers, or entire businesses, that can generate sizable yield with a small asset base are considered to be more efficient, and likely offer more value.
 
 
    Increasing a Low Yield on Earning Assets    
  Increasing a low yield on earning assets often involves a review and  restructuring  of a company’s policies and approach to  risk management , as well as a review of the general operations of how the company chooses which loans to provide to which markets.
 
 
  Depending on the business or strategy, at times, yield on earning assets may need to be adjusted for various methods when compiling financial statements. For instance, certain  off-balance  sheet items could distort reported yield on assets when using financial statements that have not been adjusted to reflect these off-balance sheet items.
 
 
  Furthermore, financial institutions could be charging low  interest rates  to remain competitive and gain business, which would result in a lower amount of income earned. In this case, a review of a company's pricing policy would be necessary.

What Is the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?,"Definition 
 The International Monetary Fund is an international organization that promotes global economic growth, financial stability, and international trade. It aims to reduce poverty. 
    What Is the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?    
  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization that promotes global  economic growth  and financial stability, encourages international trade, and reduces poverty.
 
 
  Quotas of member countries are a key determinant of the voting power in IMF decisions. Votes comprise one vote per 100,000  special drawing rights  (SDR) of quota plus basic votes. SDRs are an international type of  monetary reserve  currency created by the IMF as a supplement to the existing money reserves of member countries.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The IMF's mission is to promote global economic growth and financial stability, encourage international trade, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF was originally created in 1945 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement, which attempted to encourage international financial cooperation by introducing a system of convertible currencies at fixed exchange rates. 1 The IMF collects massive amounts of data on national economies, international trade, and the global economy in aggregate and provides economic forecasts. One of the IMF's most important functions is to make loans to countries that are experiencing economic distress to prevent or mitigate financial crises. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu 
 
    Understanding the International Monetary Fund (IMF)    
  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is based in Washington, D.C. The organization is currently composed of 191 member countries, each of which has representation on the IMF's executive board in proportion to its financial importance. Quotas are a key determinant of the voting power in IMF decisions. Votes comprise one vote per SDR100,000 of quota plus basic votes (same for all members). 2 3 
 
 
  The IMF's website describes its mission as ""to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world."" 2 
 
 
 
 
    History of the IMF    
  The IMF was originally created in 1945 as part of the  Bretton Woods Agreement , which attempted to encourage international financial cooperation by introducing a system of convertible currencies at  fixed exchange rates . The dollar was redeemable for gold at $35 per ounce at the time. 1 
 
 
  The IMF also acted as a gatekeeper: Countries were not eligible for membership in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)—a  World Bank  forerunner that the Bretton Woods agreement created in order to fund the reconstruction of Europe after World War II—unless they were members of the IMF. 4 5 
 
 
  Since the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the 1970s, the IMF has promoted the system of  floating exchange rates , meaning that market forces determine the value of currencies relative to one another. This system remains in place today. 6 
 
 
    IMF Activities    
  The IMF's primary methods for achieving these goals are monitoring capacity building and lending.
 
 
   Important 
 The reports the IMF publishes on its monetary surveillance include the ""World Economic Outlook,"" the ""Global Financial Stability Report,"" and the ""Fiscal Monitor."" 
 
 
 
    Surveillance    
  The IMF collects massive amounts of data on national economies,  international trade , and the global economy in aggregate. The organization also provides regularly updated economic forecasts at the national and international levels. These forecasts, published in the World Economic Outlook, are accompanied by lengthy discussions on the effect of fiscal, monetary, and trade policies on growth prospects and financial stability.
 
 
    Capacity Building    
  The IMF provides technical assistance, training, and policy advice to member countries through its capacity-building programs. These programs include training in data collection and analysis, which feed into the IMF's project of monitoring national and global economies. 7 
 
 
    Lending    
  The IMF makes  loans  to countries that are experiencing economic distress to prevent or mitigate financial crises. Members contribute the funds for this lending to a pool based on a quota system. For example, in 2019, loan resources in the amount of SDR 11.4 billion (SDR 0.4 billion above target) were secured to support the IMF’s concessional lending activities into the next decade. 8 
 
 
  IMF funds are often conditional on recipients making reforms to increase their growth potential and financial stability.  Structural adjustment  programs, as these conditional loans are known, have attracted criticism for exacerbating poverty and reproducing colonialist structures. 9

 Definition 
 A positive correlation is a statistical term used to describe a situation when two variables move in the same direction. 
    What Is Positive Correlation?    
  A positive correlation means two variables move in the same direction, so when one thing goes up so does the other. Similarly, when one goes down, the other one follows. The idea behind a positive correlation is that both variables are theoretically influenced by the same external factors. For instance, when companies spend money on their marketing efforts, their sales may increase. Similarly, if you exercise more, your health may improve. Industry officials can use these correlations to make important decisions and predictions about one variable based on the behavior of the other. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables that tend to move in the same direction. Both variables in a positive correlation tend to be influenced by the same external factors. Positive correlations can be used as important decision-making tools. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Ellen Lindner 
 
    Understanding Positive Correlation    
  A perfectly positive  correlation  means that 100% of the time, the variables in question move together by the exact same percentage and direction. A positive correlation can be seen between the demand for a product and the product's associated price. In situations where the available supply stays the same, the price will rise if demand increases. 
 
 
  Additionally, gains or losses in certain markets may lead to similar movements in associated markets. As the price of fuel rises, the prices of airline tickets also rise. Since airplanes require fuel to operate, an increase in this cost is often passed to the consumer, leading to a positive correlation between fuel prices and airline ticket prices.
 
 
  A positive correlation does not guarantee  growth  or benefit. Instead, it is used to denote any two or more variables that move in the same direction together, so when one increases, so does the other. The existence of a correlation does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between variables.
 
 
 
 
  Correlation is a form of dependency, where a shift in one variable means a change is likely in the other, or that certain known variables produce specific results. A general example can be seen within complementary product demand. If the demand for vehicles rises, so will the demand for vehicular-related products and services, such as tires. An increase in one area affects complementary industries.

 Definition 
 An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking device that allows customers to perform basic financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals and check deposits. 
    What Is an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)?    
  An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs, either in the U.S. or other countries.
 
 
  ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals,  bill payments , and transfers between accounts.
 
 
  Fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is located, by the operator of the ATM, or by both. Some or all of these fees can be avoided by using an ATM operated directly by the bank network that holds the account. Using an ATM abroad can cost more than using one in the U.S. due to exchange rates or transaction fees. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 ATMS, or automated teller machines, are banking outlets where you can withdraw cash without going into a branch of their bank. Some ATMs only dispense cash, while others allow transactions such as check deposits or balance transfers. The first ATMs appeared in 1960s and now number more than 2 million worldwide. Today’s ATMs are capable of accepting deposits as well as administering several other banking services. To avoid ATM fees, try to use an ATM by your own bank. 
 
    History of ATMs    
  The first ATM appeared at a branch of Barclays Bank in London in 1967, though there are reports of a cash dispenser in use in Japan in the mid-1960s. 2 3  The interbank communications networks that allowed a consumer to use one bank’s card at another bank’s ATM followed in the 1970s.
 
 
  Within a few years, ATMs had spread around the globe, securing a presence in every major country. They now can be found even in tiny island nations such as Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia. 4

    What Is a Balloon Payment?    
  A balloon payment is the final amount due on a loan that is structured as a series of small monthly payments followed by a single much larger sum at the end of the loan period. The early payments may be all or almost all payments of interest owed on the loan, with the balloon payment being the principal of the loan. This type of loan is known as a balloon loan.
 
 
  The balloon home mortgage loan became common in the years before the  2007-2008 financial crisis.  It allowed people eager to buy a home to obtain a mortgage payment that they could afford, at least in the early years.
 
 
  The balloon loan did not disappear with the financial crisis but is now more often used for business loans. A project can be financed with a loan that allows for minimal payments early on, with the balloon payment due only when the project is earning a return on the investment.
 
 
  The balloon payment is similar to a  bullet repayment .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A balloon payment is a type of loan structured so that the last payment is far larger than prior payments. Balloon payments are an option for home mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Borrowers have lower initial monthly payments under a balloon loan. The interest rate is usually higher for a balloon loan, and only borrowers with high creditworthiness are considered. The balloon payment may be a weighted payment amount or, under an interest-only payment plan, be the full balance of the principal due. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Joules Garcia 
 
    Understanding Balloon Payments    
  As the term ""balloon"" suggests, the final payment on this type of loan is significantly large.
 
 
  In recent years, balloon payments have been more common in commercial lending than in consumer lending. It allows a commercial lender to keep short-term costs lower and take care of the balloon payment with future earnings.
 
 
  The same logic is used by individual homebuyers, but the risks are greater. Homebuyers are keeping their short-term costs low while assuming that their incomes will be far greater when the balloon payment comes due, that they will be able to refinance their mortgage before it is due, or that they can sell the house and pay off the entire mortgage before the balloon payment comes due.
 
 
  That strategy failed in the  2008-2009 financial crisis , when homeowners who financed their purchases with balloon mortgages found it impossible to sell their homes at a price high enough to pay off the amount they had borrowed.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Balloon payments are often packaged into two-step mortgages. In this financing structure, a borrower receives an introductory and often lower interest rate at the start of their loan. Then, the loan shifts to a higher interest rate after an initial borrowing period. 
 
 
 
    Balloon Payment Examples    
  A balloon debt structure can be implemented for any type of debt. It's most commonly used in mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.
 
 
    Mortgage    
  The balloon mortgage is rarely used for traditional 15-year or 30-year mortgages since lenders don't want to wait that long to get their money back. For balloon mortgages, lenders prefer a five-year to ten-year term.
 
 
  Interest-only balloon mortgages are available primarily to high-net-worth individuals who can afford large down payments. They are often taken with the intention of refinancing before the balloon payment is due.
 
 
    Balloon Loan vs. ARM    
  A balloon loan is sometimes confused with an  adjustable-rate mortgage  (ARM). With an ARM, the borrower receives an introductory rate fo",0 seconds of 57 seconds,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balloon-payment.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

    What Is a Leveraged Buyout?    
  A leveraged buyout (LBO) is the acquisition of one company by another using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the  cost of acquisition . The borrowed money can be in the form of bonds or loans. The assets of the company being acquired are often used as collateral for the loans along with the assets of the acquiring company.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A leveraged buyout (LBO) occurs when the acquisition of a company is completed almost entirely with borrowed funds. Leveraged buyouts declined in popularity after the 2008 financial crisis but they are again on the rise. In an LBO, the ratio of debt to equity used for the takeover will be as high as possible. LBOs have acquired a reputation as a ruthless and predatory business tactic because the target company's assets can be used as leverage against it.

    Understanding Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)    
  In an LBO, the ratio of debt to equity used for the takeover will be as high as possible. The exact amount of debt that will be used depends on the market lending conditions, investor appetite, and the amount of cash flow that the company is expected to generate after takeover. 1  The bonds issued in the buyout usually aren't investment grade and are referred to as  junk bonds  because of this high  debt/equity ratio .
 
 
   Important 
 The purpose of leveraged buyouts is to allow companies to make large acquisitions without having to commit a lot of capital. 
 
 
 
  Returns are generated in an LBO in three ways:
 
 
   The company pays down its debt and this deleveraging increases the amount of equity in the company. Investors are able to improve profit margins by reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenditures and improving sales. The company will be sold at the end of the investment period at a higher multiple than the investment company paid, a process called margin expansion. 
 
 
 
 
  Private equity investment groups that carry out LBOs have garnered a reputation for being ruthless and predatory because of their need to rapidly increase margins. To do this, many investors embark on strict cost-cutting measures that can include making staff redundant.

  To make their returns, the private equity investors have to sell or realize their investment over a relatively short timeframe. Typically, LBO investments are held for between 5 years and 7 years, although there can be shorter or longer holding periods.
 
 
  There are several ways the investment can be realized:
 
 
 
 Taking the  private  company public 
 Selling to a competitor 
 Undergoing another round of private investment with a second LBO 
 
 
  Usually, LBOs are undertaken because a private equity investment group have identified the company as a good target. A good target is one that is able to generate annualized returns in excess of 20% and so the company must generate cash to pay down debt (""deleverage"") and should have opportunities for margin and multiple improvements.
 
 
    Examples of Leveraged Buyouts

 Definition 
 Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s to help investors and traders gauge market volatility and identify when securities are poised to rise or fall. 
  Bollinger Bands, a popular tool among investors and traders, helps gauge the volatility of stocks and other securities to determine if they are over- or undervalued. Developed in the 1980s by financial analyst John Bollinger, the bands appear on stock charts as three lines that move with the price. The center line is the stock price's 20-day simple moving average (SMA). The upper and lower bands are set at a certain number of standard deviations, usually two, above and below the middle line.
 
 
  The bands widen when a stock's price becomes more volatile and contract when it is more stable. Many traders see stocks as overbought as their price nears the upper band and oversold as they approach the lower band, signaling an opportune time to trade. 1 
 
 
  While valuable, Bollinger Bands are a secondary indicator that is best used to confirm other analysis methods. Below, we guide you through how to interpret Bollinger Bands, when the tool is best used, and what other indicators are best matched with it.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool used to determine where prices are high and low relative to each other. These bands are composed of three lines: a simple moving average (the middle band) and an upper and lower band. The upper and lower bands are typically two standard deviations above or below a 20-period simple moving average (SMA). The bands widen and narrow as the volatility of the underlying asset changes.

    Who Is John Bollinger?    
  John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, has been a major influence in technical analysis and is best known for developing Bollinger Bands in the 1980s. Bollinger combined his background in mathematics and engineering with financial market analysis to create this tool, which uses a moving average and the statistical measure of standard deviation to assess the volatility and trends of stock prices. 2  The tool has since become a staple in technical analysis. He is also the founder of Bollinger Capital Management, a money management company, and has been a prominent commentator and analyst on market conditions. 3

    Constructing Bollinger Bands    
  The three lines that make up Bollinger Bands are based on a security's price moves. The center line is the intermediate-term trend and is typically a 20-day  SMA  of the closing prices. The upper and lower bands are plotted a distance from the SMA set by a certain number of standard deviations, usually two, above and below the center line. 1

"How a Home Equity Loan Works, Rates, Requirements & Calculator","What Is a Home Equity Loan?    
  A home equity loan—also known as an equity loan, home equity installment loan, or  second mortgage —is a type of consumer debt. Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes. The loan amount is based on the difference between the home’s current market value and the  homeowner’s mortgage balance due . Home equity loans tend to be fixed-rate, while the typical alternative,  home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) , generally have variable rates.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 A home equity loan, also known as a home equity installment loan or a second  mortgage , is a type of consumer debt. 
 Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their residence.  
 Home equity loan amounts are based on the difference between a home’s current market value and the homeowner’s mortgage balance due. 
 Home equity loans come in two varieties: fixed-rate loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).  
 Fixed-rate home equity loans provide one lump sum, whereas HELOCs offer borrowers revolving lines of credit. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    How a Home Equity Loan Works    
  Essentially, a home equity loan is akin to a mortgage, hence the name second mortgage. The  equity in the home  serves as  collateral  for the  lender . The amount that a homeowner is allowed to borrow will be based partially on a  combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio  of 80% to 90% of the home’s  appraised  value. Of course, the amount of the loan and the rate of interest charged also depend on the borrower’s  credit score  and payment history.
 
 
   Warning 
 Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal.  If you think that you’ve been discriminated against  based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps that you can take. One such step is to file a report with the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  or the  United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) . 
 
 
 
  Traditional home equity loans have a set  repayment  term, just  like conventional mortgages . The borrower makes regular, fixed payments covering both  principal  and  interest . As with any mortgage, if the loan is not paid off, the home could be sold to satisfy  the remaining debt .
 
 
  A home equity loan can be a good way to  convert the equity you’ve built up  in your home into cash, especially if you invest that cash in home renovations that increase the value of your home. However, always remember that you’re putting your home on the line—if real estate values decrease, you could end up owing more than your home is worth.
 
 
 
 
  Should you want to relocate, you might end up losing money on the sale of the home or be unable to move. And if you’re getting the loan  to pay off credit card debt , resist the temptation to run up those credit card bills again. Before doing something that puts your house in jeopardy, weigh all of your options.
 
 
 
“If considering a home equity loan for a large amount, be sure to  compare rates  on multiple loan types. A  cash-out refinance  may be a better option than a home equity loan, depending on how much you need.”
 
 
  — Marguerita Cheng,  CFP, Chief Executive Officer, Blue Ocean Global Wealth
 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Home equity loans exploded in popularity after the  Tax Reform Act of 1986  because they provided a way for consumers to get around one of its main provisions: the elimination of deductions for the interest on most consumer purchases. The act left in place one big exception: interest in the service of residence-based debt. 1  
 
 
  However, the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  suspended the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans and HELOCs until 2026—unless, according to the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) , “they are used to buy, build or substantially improve the taxpayer’s home that secures the loan.” For example, the interest on a home equity loan  used to consolidate debts  or pay for a child’s college expenses is not tax deductible. 2 
 
 
  As with a mortgage, you can ask for a  good faith estimate , but before you do, make your own honest estimate of your finances. “You should have a good sense of where your credit and home value are  before applying , in order to save money,” says  Casey Fleming , author of  The Loan Guide: How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage . “Especially on the appraisal [of your home], which is a major expense. If your appraisal comes in too low to support the loan, the money is already spent”—and there are no refunds for not qualifying.
 
 
  Before signing—especially if you’re using the home equity loan for  debt consolidation —run the numbers with your bank and make sure that the loan’s  monthly payments  will indeed be lower than the combined payments of all your current obligations. Even though home equity loans have lower interest rates, your term on the new lo","By

 Definition 
 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) presents the percentage change in prices that consumers pay for goods and services. 
    What Is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)?    
  The Consumer Price Index (CPI), calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), measures the monthly change in price for a figurative basket of goods and services. These items can change over time. 1 2 
 
 
  CPI is a  weighted average  of prices and is representative of aggregate U.S. consumer spending. It is used as a metric for inflation and deflation. 3 
 
 
  The CPI report uses a different survey methodology, price samples, and index weights than the  producer price index (PPI) , which measures changes in the prices paid by U.S. producers of goods and services.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The composition of the group of goods and services assessed by the Consumer Price Index can change over time. The CPI is a widely used measure of inflation, closely followed by policymakers, financial markets, businesses, and consumers. It's based on about 80,000 price quotes collected every month from retail stores, service establishments, rental units, and doctors' offices.

    Data Adjustments    
  The CPI accounts for  substitution effects —consumers' tendency to shift spending away from products and product categories that have grown relatively more expensive with time.
 
 
 
 
  It also adjusts price data for changes in product quality and features. The weighting of the product and service categories in the CPI indexes corresponds to recent consumer spending patterns derived from a separate survey. 7 8 
 
 
  Shelter category prices are based on a survey of rental prices for 50,000 housing units. They are then used to calculate the rise in rental prices as well as owners' equivalents.
 
 
  The owners' equivalent category models the rent equivalent for owner-occupied housing to properly reflect housing costs' share of  consumer spending . 5 6 
 
 
    Types of CPIs    
  The BLS publishes two CPI indexes each month. The  Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)  represents 93% of the U.S. population not living in remote rural areas.
 
 
  It doesn't cover spending by people living in farm households, institutions, or on military bases. CPI-U is the basis of the widely reported CPI numbers that matter to financial markets. 
The BLS also publishes the  Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) . The CPI-W covers 29% of the U.S. population living in households with income derived predominantly from clerical employment or jobs with an hourly wage. 5 
 
 
  CPI-W is used to adjust Social Security payments as well as other federal benefits and pensions for changes in the cost of living.

    What Is a Hostile Takeover?    
  A hostile takeover happens when an entity takes control of a company against the wishes of the company's management. It's an acquisition strategy requiring that the entity acquire and control more than 50% of the voting shares issued by the company.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A hostile takeover is when an acquiring company attempts to take over a target company against the wishes of the target company's management. An acquiring company can achieve a hostile takeover by going directly to the target company's shareholders or fighting to replace its management. Hostile takeovers may take place if a company believes a target is undervalued or when activist shareholders want changes in a company. A tender offer and a proxy fight are two methods for achieving a hostile takeover. Target companies can use certain defenses, such as a poison pill or a golden parachute, to ward off hostile takeovers. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Matthew Collins 
 
    Understanding Hostile Takeovers    
  A hostile takeover allows the new majority shareholder(s) to control the acquired business. The company being acquired in a hostile  takeover  is called the target company, while the one executing the takeover is called the acquirer. Reasons that hostile takeovers occur, from the acquiring party's point of view, often coincide with those of any other acquisition or merger, such as:
 
 
 
 A belief that a company may be significantly  undervalued 
 A desire to access or own a company's brand, operations, technology, or industry foothold 
 A strategic move by  activist investors  looking to effect change in a company's operations 
 
 
  Hostile takeovers are generally initiated in one of two ways:
 
 
 
 A  tender offer  to  purchase the voting shares  of another company  at a premium  above the  current market value  (CMV) 
 In a  proxy  fight, where the entity tries to persuade stockholders to vote out the current management and vote in management that would allow the takeover

 The  Williams Act  of 1968 regulates tender offers and requires the disclosure of all-cash tender offers. 1 
 
 
 
    Defenses Against a Hostile Takeover    
  To deter unwanted takeovers, companies may have preemptive defenses or employ reactive defenses to fight back. Some of these defenses are:
 
 
   Differential voting rights Employee stock ownership program Crown jewel Poison pill 
 
 
    Differential Voting Rights (DVRs)    
  To protect against hostile takeovers, a company can establish stock with differential  voting rights  (DVRs), where  some shares carry greater voting power  than others. This can make it more difficult to generate the votes needed for a hostile takeover if management owns a large enough portion of shares with more voting power. Shares with less voting power can also pay a higher  dividend , making them more attractive investments.
 
 
    Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP)    
  Establishing an  employee stock ownership program  (ESOP) involves using a tax-qualified plan in which employees own a substantial interest in the company. Employees may be more likely to vote with management. As such, this can be a successful defense.

 Definition 
 Bayes' Theorem is a formula used to calculate the probability of an outcome given a known previous outcome that occurred in similar circumstances. 
    What Is Bayes' Theorem?    
  Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring based on a previous outcome in similar circumstances. Thus, Bayes' Theorem provides a way to revise or update an existing prediction or theory given new evidence.
 
 
  In finance, Bayes' Theorem can be used to evaluate or reevaluate the  risk  of lending money to a potential borrower.
 
 
  Bayes' Theorem is named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes. It is also called Bayes' Rule or Bayes' Law and is the foundation of the field of Bayesian statistics.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Bayes' Theorem can be used to revise a probability analysis based on new information. It is often employed in finance to calculate or update risk evaluation. It is used widely in other fields, such as analyses of medical test results. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Lara Antal 
 
    Understanding Bayes' Theorem    
  Applications of Bayes' Theorem are widespread and not limited to the financial realm. For example, Bayes' theorem can be used to determine the accuracy of medical test results by taking into consideration how likely any given person is to have a disease and the general accuracy of the test. Bayes' theorem relies on incorporating  prior probability  distributions in order to generate  posterior probabilities .
 
 
  In Bayesian statistical inference, prior probability is the probability of an event occurring before new data is collected. In other words, it represents the best rational assessment of the probability of a particular outcome based on current knowledge before an experiment is performed.

  Posterior probability is the revised probability of an event occurring after considering the new information. Posterior probability is calculated by updating the prior probability using Bayes' theorem. Put another way, the posterior probability is the probability of event A occurring, given that event B has occurred.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Bayes' Theorem gives the probability of an event based on new information that is or may be related to that event. The formula also can be used to determine how the probability of an event occurring may be affected by hypothetical new information, supposing the new information will turn out to be true.
 
 
   Example: A Deck of Cards 
 Consider drawing a single card from a complete deck of 52 cards. There are four kings in the deck, so the probability that the card is a king is four divided by 52, which equals 1/13 or approximately 7.69%. Now, suppose it is revealed that the selected card is a face card.

 Definition 
 A bill of lading is a contract between a carrier and a shipper. 
    What Is a Bill of Lading?    
  The bill of lading, which is part receipt, part contract, and part proof of ownership, is a tool in global trade. This document provides a clear audit trail when shipping goods. Electronic systems can be used to track changes to bills of lading, recording who made modifications to the shipment and when revisions occurred. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A bill of lading must accompany shipped goods and be signed by an authorized representative from the carrier, shipper, and receiver. Three types of bills of lading include straight bill of lading, order bill of lading, and bearer bill of lading. Legally binding under maritime law, a bill of lading is required for international trade. 
 
    How a Bill of Lading Is Used    
  A bill of lading is a legal document used in international trade and shipping. Far from mere paperwork, this centuries-old instrument is the backbone of the multi-trillion-dollar shipping industry.
 
 
  Yet, despite the digital revolution, only 2.1% of the 45 million bills of lading issued in 2022 were electronic. It's as if we're still using carrier pigeons in the age of email. Yet experts estimate that digitizing this single document could unlock more than $15.5 billion in direct benefits to the shipping ecosystem and up to $40 billion in increased trade. 1 2  It serves three main purposes:
 
 
   It acts as a receipt for goods, confirming that the carrier has received the specific items in the stated conditions. It provides evidence of the contract between the shipper and carrier, outlining the terms of transportation. It functions as a document of title, representing ownership of the goods and allowing the holder to claim them upon delivery. 3 
 
 
  Legally binding under  maritime law , the document is needed for the release of payment and resolution of disputes in international trade. It records the consignment's journey from the point of origin to its final destination. 4

   An example bill of lading. 
 
    Straight Bill of Lading    
  A straight bill of lading is a nonnegotiable document that specifies a designated consignee to whom the goods must be delivered. It can't be transferred to another party after being issued, making it suitable for direct shipments where the buyer has already paid for the goods or for transactions not requiring payment, such as gifts or returns.
 
 
  The carrier is obligated to deliver the cargo only to the named consignee, providing a secure method of shipment. This type of bill never includes the phrase ""to order"" and is often used when there's no need for the ownership of goods to be transferred during transit. 5 6 
 
 
    Order Bill of Lading    
  An order bill of lading is a negotiable document that allows for the transfer of ownership of goods during transit. It typically includes the phrase ""to the order of [name of a party]"" and can be endorsed to transfer title.
 
 
  This flexibility makes it ideal for international trade scenarios where goods might be sold multiple times while in transit. It's particularly useful in transactions involving letters of credit or when the exact buyer is unknown at the time of shipme","0 seconds of 1 minute, 26 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billoflading.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Meaning and Rules,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?    
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in and outside of the  European Union  (EU).
 
 
  Approved in 2016 and put into effect in 2018, the GDPR is the toughest security and privacy law in the world. It aims to give consumers control over their own personal data by holding companies responsible for the way they handle and treat this information. 1 
 
 
  The regulation applies regardless of where websites are based, which means it must be heeded by all sites that attract European visitors, even if they don't specifically market goods or services to EU residents. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The General Data Protection Regulation is a law that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals. The law was approved in 2016 but didn't go into effect until May 2018. The GDPR provides consumers with more control over how their personal data is handled and disseminated by companies. Companies must inform consumers about what they do with consumer data and every time that data is breached. GDPR rules apply to any website regardless of where they are based. 
 
    Understanding the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)    
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law that was approved by the European Union in April 2016 and went into effect on May 25, 2018. 2 
 
 
  It replaced an earlier law, the Data Protection Directive, and was set up to regulate the way  companies  process and use the personal data they collect from consumers online. It also has rules in the way that information is moved, whether that's partly or entirely through automated means.
 
 
  The law makes it difficult for companies to mislead consumers with confusing or vague language when they visit their websites. It also ensures:
 
 
 
 Website visitors are notified of the data collected. 
 Visitors explicitly consent to that information-gathering by clicking on a button or some other action. 
 Sites notify visitors in a timely way if any of their personal data held by the site is ever breached. 
 There is a mandated assessment of the site's data security. 
 Whether a dedicated  data protection officer  (DPO) needs to be hired or an existing staffer can carry out this function. 3 4 5 
 
 
 
 
  These requirements may be more stringent than those required in the jurisdiction in which the site is located.
 
 
  Information on how to contact the DPO and other relevant staffers must be accessible so that visitors may exercise their EU data rights, which also includes the ability to have their presence on the site erased, among other measures. The site must also add staff and other resources to be capable of carrying out such requests. 6 
 
 
   Note 
 The requirement of an ""Agree"" button largely explains the ubiquitous presence of disclosures that sites collect cookies, which are small files that hold personal information such as site settings and preferences. 
 
    Special Considerations    
  As further protection for consumers, the GDPR also calls for any  personally identifiable information  (PII) that sites collect to be either anonymized (rendered anonymous) or pseudonymized with the consumer's identity replaced with a pseudonym. 7 
 
 
  This allows firms to do more extensive data analysis, such as assessing the average debt ratios of their customers in a particular region—a calculation that might otherwise be beyond the original purposes of data collected for assessing creditworthiness for a loan.
 
 
  The regulation applies to all 27 members of the EU and the  European Economic Area  (EEA), regardless of where websites and residents are based. As such, it must be heeded by all sites that attract European visitors, even if they don't specifically market goods or services to EU residents.
 
 
  So the regulation applies to the data of an EU citizen even if it is housed in the U.S. Similarly, a U.S. citizen who resides in the EU is covered whenever they visit sites based in the union. 
 
 
   Important 
 The GDPR affects data beyond that collected from customers. Most notably, perhaps, the regulation applies to the human resources records of employees. 2 
 
 
 
    Criticism of the GDPR    
  The GDPR has attracted criticism in some quarters. Some say that the requirement to appoint DPOs, or simply to assess the need for them imposes an undue administrative burden on certain companies. Some complain that the guidelines are too vague on how best to deal with employee data.
 
 
  In addition, data cannot be transferred to another country outside the EU, unless the receiving company guarantees the same degree of protection as the EU requires. This has led to complaints about costly disruption to  business practices .
 
 
  There's a further concern that the costs associated with GDPR wil","By

"LIBOR: What Was the London Interbank Offered Rate, and How Was It Used?","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) was a key reference point for the interest rates banks charged each other on short-term loans across global financial markets. 
    What Was the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)?    
  The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was a  benchmark  interest rate for short-term loans between major global banks. It was mostly phased out in 2023 and then completely in 2024.
 
 
  From 1986 to the 2000s, LIBOR was a globally accepted key benchmark for the cost of borrowing between banks. The rate was calculated and published each day by the  Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) , but scandals and questions around its validity as a benchmark rate resulted in it being phased out.
 
 
  According to the Federal Reserve and regulators in the United Kingdom, LIBOR was phased out on June 30, 2023, and replaced by the  Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) . LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBORs stopped publishing as of Dec. 31, 2021, as part of the phaseout. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 LIBOR was the benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lent to one another. LIBOR was administered by the Intercontinental Exchange, which asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans. The rate was calculated using the Waterfall Methodology, a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method. LIBOR had been subject to manipulation, scandal, and methodological critique, making it less credible as a benchmark rate. LIBOR was replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) on June 30, 2023. 
 
    How LIBOR Worked    
  LIBOR was the average interest rate at which major global banks borrowed from one another. It was based on five currencies—the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc—and served seven different maturities: overnight/spot next, one week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months. 1 
 
 
 
 
  Interbank lending is the basis for consumer loans in countries around the world, so it impacts consumers just as much as it does financial institutions. The interest rates on various credit products, such as credit cards, car loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), fluctuate based on the  interbank rate . This change in rate helps determine the ease of borrowing between banks and consumers.

  The combination of five currencies and seven maturities led to a total of 35 different LIBORs calculated and reported each business day. The most commonly quoted rate was the three-month U.S. dollar rate, usually referred to as the current LIBOR. 1 
 
 
  ICE calculated the LIBOR by asking major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans. The association took out the highest and lowest figures, then  calculated the average  from the remaining numbers. This is known as the trimmed average.
 
 
  This rate was posted each morning as the daily rate and announced and published once a day around 11:55 a.m. London time by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). 1 
 
 
   Important 
 LIBOR was phased out in June 2023 and replaced by the Secure Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). 
 
 
 
    How Was LIBOR Calculated?    
  The IBA had a designated panel of global banks for each currency and tenor pair. For example, 16 major banks, including Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS, constituted the panel for the U.S. dollar LIBOR. Only those banks with a significant role in the London market were considered eligible for membership on the ICE LIBOR panel, and the selection process was held annually. 1 
 
 
  In April 2018, the IBA submitted a new proposal to strengthen the LIBOR calculation methodology. It suggested a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method called the Waterfall Methodology for determining LIBOR. 2 
 
 
 
 The first transaction-based level involved taking a  volume-weighted average price (VWAP)  of all eligible transactions that a panel bank may have assigned a higher weighting for transactions booked closer to 11 a.m. London time. 
 The second transaction-derived level involved taking submissions based on transaction-derived data from a panel bank if it did not have a sufficient number of eligible transactions to make a Level 1 submission. 
 The third level—expert judgment—would come into play when a panel bank failed to make a Level 1 or a Level 2 submission. It would submit the rate at which it could finance itself at 11 a.m. London time, with reference to the unsecured, wholesale funding market.

"Systematic Sampling: What Is It, and How Is It Used in Research?","Definition 
 Systematic sampling happens when a random sample is selected from a larger population at a regular interval. 
    What Is Systematic Sampling?    
  Systematic sampling is a probability  sampling  method where samples from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This sampling interval is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A fixed periodic interval defines systematic sampling. The fixed periodic interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size. Advantages of this methodology include eliminating the phenomenon of clustered selection and a low probability of contaminating data. Disadvantages include overrepresentation or underrepresentation of particular patterns and a greater risk of data manipulation. There are three main types of systematic samples: random systematic samples, linear systematic samples, and circular systematic samples. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Systematic sampling can help minimize bias compared to other sampling methods. 
 Nez Riaz / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Systematic Sampling    
  When carried out correctly on a large population of a defined size, systematic sampling can help researchers, including  marketing  and sales professionals, obtain representative findings on a huge group of people without having to reach out to each and every one of them.
 
 
  Since  simple random sampling  of a population can be inefficient and time-consuming,  statisticians  turn to other methods, such as systematic sampling. Choosing a sample size through a systematic approach can be done quickly. Once a fixed starting point has been identified, a constant interval is selected to facilitate participant selection.
 
 
  Systematic sampling is preferable to simple random sampling when there is a low risk of data manipulation. If such a risk is high when a researcher can manipulate the interval length to obtain desired results, then a simple random sampling technique would be more appropriate.
 
 
 
 
  Systematic sampling is popular with researchers and analysts because of its simplicity. Researchers generally assume the results are representative of most normal  populations  unless a random characteristic disproportionately exists with every nth data sample (which is unlikely). In other words, a population needs to exhibit a natural degree of randomness along with the chosen metric. If the population has a type of standardized pattern, then the risk of accidentally choosing very common cases is more apparent.
 
 
  Within systematic sampling, as with other sampling methods, a target population must be selected prior to selecting participants. A population can be identified based on any number of desired characteristics that suit the purpose of the study being conducted. Some selection criteria may include age, gender, race, location, education level, or profession.
 
 
   Important 
 There are several methods of sampling a population for statistical inference. Systematic sampling is one form of random sampling. 
 
 
 
    When to Use Systematic Sampling    
  One situation where systematic sampling may be best suited is when the population being studied exhibits a degree of order or regularity. For example, if you’re surveying customers entering a store, systematic sampling allows you to systematically select every nth customer, ensuring representation across different times of the day or week. This approach helps to avoid bias that may arise from selecting only customers who arrive during specific periods.
 
 
  Another scenario where systematic sampling can work well is when the population size is known and relatively large. Instead of having to list and randomly select individuals from the entire population, systematic sampling simplifies the process by selecting samples at a set cadence. This is particularly useful in large-scale studies where time and resources are limited, meaning you don’t need to spend a large amount of energy planning out the sample.
 
 
  Systematic sampling can be used when researchers want to ensure that the sample is evenly spread across the entire population. For example, a company could select every nth person from the company directory filtered by last name. Other forms of sampling may accidentally cluster similar populations (i.e., too many people from finance are selected based on how the sample is aggregated).
 
 
  Additionally, systematic sampling offers the advantage of simplicity and ease of implementation compared to other sampling methods. It requires minimal computation and can be easily executed using simple  algorithms , especially if the target sample size and total population size are known.
 
 
    Steps to Create a Systematic Sample

"Visual Basic for Applications (VBA): Definition, Uses, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a programming language embedded in Microsoft Office that can be used to automate processes and build functions. 
    What Is Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)?    
  Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is used to write programs for Microsoft Office (MS Office, Office) applications, including Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Word, and Visio.
 
 
  VBA allows users to customize beyond what's normally available with MS Office host applications. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Visual Basic for Applications is a computer programming language developed and owned by Microsoft. You can create macros to automate repetitive word- and data-processing functions with VBA and generate custom forms, graphs, and reports. VBA is not a standalone product; it functions within MS Office applications. VBA is accessed in Excel by hitting Alt + F11 when using an Excel workbook. VBA leverages objects, variables, properties, projects, logical operators, and modules to make statements recognizable by debugging processes. 
 
    Understanding Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)    
  VBA is an event-driven tool. You can use it to tell the computer to initiate an action or string of actions by typing commands into an editing module to build custom macroinstructions (macros).
 
 
  A macro is essentially a sequence of inputs that result in a sequence of outputs. This accomplishes specific computing tasks. You don't have to purchase the VBA software because VBA ships with Microsoft Office.
 
 
  VBA allows users to manipulate graphical user interface (GUI) features such as toolbars, menus, dialogue boxes, and forms. You can use VBA to create user-defined functions (UDFs), access Windows  application programming interfaces (APIs) , and automate specific computer processes and calculations. 2 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Microsoft hosts various  learning opportunities  for entry-level developers to gain modest experience working with VBA. 3 
 
 
 
    VBA in Excel    
  All Office suite programs share common programming languages, and each is capable of integrating VBA code to enhance it. VBA has been a natural fit with Excel, more so than with other Office suite programs, because of the repetitive nature of spreadsheets,  data analytics , and organizing data.
 
 
  The root of the relationship between VBA and Excel is often tied to using macros. You can use VBA to run a macro in Excel, but you can also use it for non-macro activities.
 
 
    How to Access VBA in Excel    
  Simply press Alt + F11 to access VBA in Excel. 4  Your existing Excel workbook will remain running, but a new window will appear for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. The top left of the VBA window will show the current projects. The InvestopediaProject file is ready to receive VBA code in this example:
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   VBA, Project Window. 
 
  The window displays the properties of the selected project at the bottom left. Properties are listed as projects or workbooks are selected. These properties are listed alphabetically by default, although they can be sorted by category.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   VBA Example, Properties. 
 
  A new window appears when you double-click on a project on the top left. There's no information in this area, but you'll see two dropdowns that say ""(General)"" and ""(Declarations)."" VBA code is directly entered into this coding window.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   VBA Example, Code. 
 
  Here's an example of a VBA code that's been entered:
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   VBA Example, Code with Coding. 
 
  Many important buttons and tools appear on the toolbar. The items highlighted in yellow are the run, break, and reset toggles for the VBA code. The run button executes the code. The break button pauses the code activity. The reset stops the execution of the code and brings the process back to the starting position of the code.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   VBA Example, Toolbar. 
 
    What You Can Do With VBA    
  Financial modeling is about manipulating huge amounts of data, and VBA is endemic to the  financial services sector . It's likely running within applications you use each day if you work in finance, if you're not aware of it. Some jobs in the industry require prior knowledge of VBA, others don't. You can:
 
 
 
 Write macros :   Macros allow financial professionals such as accountants, commercial bankers,  investment bankers , research analysts, salespeople, traders, portfolio managers, clerks, and administrators to analyze and adjust huge amounts of data quickly. 
 Update data : You can use VBA in Excel to create and maintain complex trading, pricing, and risk-management models, to forecast sales and earnings, and to generate financial ratios. 
 Perform scenario analysis : You can create various portfolio management and  investment scenarios  with Visual Basic for Applications. This includes filtering through situations that may impact outcomes differently.

 Definition 
 A margin call is a broker’s demand that an investor who has borrowed money to buy securities must deposit more money or securities into their account so it’s brought up a minimum value. 
  A margin call is a request for funds from a broker when money must be added to a margin account to meet minimum capital requirements. A margin call occurs when the percentage of an investor’s equity in a  margin account  falls below the broker’s required amount.
 
 
  An investor’s margin account contains securities bought with a combination of the investor’s own money and money that was borrowed from the investor’s broker.
 
 
  A margin call refers specifically to a broker’s demand that an investor deposit additional money or securities into the account so the value of the investor's equity and the account value rise to a minimum value indicated by the  maintenance requirement .
 
 
  A margin call is usually an indicator that the securities held in the margin account have decreased in value. The investor must choose to either deposit additional funds or marginable securities in the account or sell some of the assets held in their account when a margin call occurs.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A margin call occurs when a margin account runs low on funds, usually because of a losing trade. Margin calls are demands for additional capital or securities to bring a margin account up to the maintenance requirement. Brokers may force a trader to sell assets, regardless of the market price, to meet the margin call if the trader doesn’t deposit funds. Margin calls can also occur when a stock goes up in price and losses start mounting in accounts that have sold the stock short. Investors can avoid margin calls by monitoring their equity and keeping enough funds in their accounts to maintain the value above the required maintenance level.

  An investor is buying on margin when they pay to buy and sell securities using a combination of their own funds and money borrowed from a broker. An investor’s equity in the investment is equal to the  market value  of the securities minus the borrowed amount. 1

   Important 
 A margin call is triggered when the investor’s equity as a percentage of the total market value of securities falls below a certain required level called the maintenance margin. 
 
 
 
  The  New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE) and the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  (FINRA), the regulatory body for the majority of securities firms operating in the United States, both require that investors maintain an equity level of 25% of the total value of their securities when buying on margin. 2 3 
 
 
  Some brokerage firms may require a higher maintenance requirement, such as 50%. It is at their discretion.
 
 
  Margin calls can occur at any time due to a drop in account value but they're more likely to happen during periods of market volatility.
 
 
    Example of a Margin Call    
  Here's an example of how a change in the value of a margin account decreases an investor's equity to a level where a broker must issue a margin call.

"Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA): Definition, Exam","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA)?    
  Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) is a professional designation granted by the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association to candidates who have completed Level I and Level II examinations. The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association has established the designation of CAIA to certify that the holders have met the association’s educational standard for specialists in the area of alternative investments. 1  The alternative investments that a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst is trained to assess include  hedge funds , venture capital,  private equity , funds of funds,  derivatives , and real estate investments.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Chartered Alternative Investment Analysts are trained to assess alternatives investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, and private equity. A CAIA designation is also useful for people managing derivatives books or trading desks. Although the CFA includes alternative investments, the CAIA coverage is more in-depth. 
 
    Understanding Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA)    
  The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst designation is meant for financial professionals who will be working primarily in the alternative investment space. This usually means people working for hedge funds and private equity, although a CAIA designation is also useful to people working for traditional financial institutions in non-traditional roles, like those managing the derivatives book or the trading desk.
 
 
    Requirements for the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Designation    
  In order to receive the designation, individuals must meet minimum education and experience requirements and must pass a two-level curriculum that includes topics ranging from qualitative analysis and trading theories of alternative investments to indexation and benchmarking. 2  The Level I exam includes 200 multiple-choice questions on:
 
 
   Professional Standards and Ethics Hedge Funds Introduction to Alternative Investments Private Equity Risk Management and Portfolio Management Structured Products Real Assets 3 
 
 
 
 
  The Level II exam includes 100 multiple-choice questions and three sets of essay questions. Questions are updated each year to reflect industry progress. The questions cover:
 
 
   Commodities Professional Ethics and Standards Private Equity Asset Allocation and Institutional Investors Structured Products Hedge Funds and Managed Futures Real Assets 4 
 
 
  The exams are administered in March and September, and the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association recommends at least  200 hours of study .
 
 
  The cost of enrollment is $400, and Level I and Level II exam registration is $1,250 for each exam. 5  Once certified, there are annual membership dues of $350 for one year or $650 for two years, and a self-evaluation tool to be completed every three years to maintain the designation. 2  Early registrants and members of certain partner organizations may qualify for scholarships or discounts to help defray the cost of enrollment and sitting for the Level I and Level II exams.
 
 
    Differences Between the CAIA and the CFA    
  Similar to earning the  Chartered Financial Analyst  (CFA) designation, possessing the CAIA designation provides individuals with access to jobs, member chapters and sources of education. Because the scope of alternative investments is dramatically different from that of conventional investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds, the CAIA designation was created to distinguish those individuals who are best qualified in dealing with this class of investments. The CFA includes content on alternative investments, but the CAIA dives much deeper into the topic and the valuation methods specific to each.
 
 
  Of the two, the CFA is seen as the more difficult designation to get, as the exams cover more content and have historically had lower pass rates than the CAIA exams. Overall, the CFA is seen as an excellent general designation for the financial industry, but the CAIA can be a difference-maker in niche areas of finance like private equity or hedge funds.

 Definition 
 A transaction where an investor sells a losing security and purchases a similar one 30 days before or after the sale to try and reduce their overall tax liability. 
    What Is a Wash Sale?    
  A wash sale is a transaction in which an investor sells or trades a security at a loss and purchases “a substantially similar one” 30 days before or 30 days after the sale. 1  This is a rule enacted by the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  to prevent investors from using capital losses to their advantage at tax time.
 
 
  The wash sale rule applies to stocks, contracts, options, and all other types of securities and trading.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A wash sale occurs when an investor purchases a security 30 days before or 30 days after selling an identical or similar security. The IRS instituted the wash sale rule to prevent taxpayers from using the practice to reduce their tax liability. Investors who sell a security at a loss cannot claim it if they have purchased the same or a similar security within 30 days (before or after) the sale. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Theresa Chiechi / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Wash Sales    
  Many countries’ tax laws allow  investors  to claim a specific amount of capital losses on their taxes as an income reduction. In the United States, you can claim up to $3,000 or your total net loss, whichever is less. If you have more than $3,000 in capital losses, you can carry the additional loss forward into the following years. 2 
 
 
  The ability to carry losses led to investors inventing a loophole where they would plan to sell a losing security and buy a substantially similar one again within a short period. This allowed them to claim a  capital loss  and use that loss to mitigate tax liabilities.
 
 
  To prevent the abuse of this incentive, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) instituted the wash sale rule in the U.S. (In the United Kingdom, the practice is known as bed-and-breakfasting, and the tax rules in the U.K. have an implementation similar to the wash sale rule). The law states that if an investor buys a security within 30 days before or after selling it, any losses made from that sale cannot be counted against reported  income . This effectively removes the incentive to do a short-term wash sale.

    How It Works    
  Generally, a wash sale has three parts.
 
 
 
 An investor notices they are in a losing position, so they close it by selling the stock or exiting a trading position. 
 The sale allows them to take a loss that they can legally claim on their tax returns as a reduction of their earnings for that year, which reduces their total  tax liability . 
 The investor will look to purchase the security  at or below the price  at which they sold it—if the purchase occurred 30 days before or after the sale, it is considered a wash sale, and the loss cannot be claimed. 
 
 
   Important 
 Day traders, especially pattern day traders—those who execute more than four day trades over a five-day period in a margin account—may encounter wash sales regularly. The wash sale rule still applies to these traders. The tax implications for day traders are complex, so it’s best to consult a tax professional if you’re day trading.

Who Was John Maynard Keynes & What Is Keynesian Economics?,"Close 
 
 
 
  John Maynard Keynes was an early 20th-century British economist, best known as the founder of Keynesian economics and the father of modern  macroeconomics . One of the hallmarks of Keynesian economics is the idea that governments should actively try to influence the course of economies, especially by increasing spending to stimulate demand in the face of  recession .
 
 
  In his seminal work, ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money""—considered one of the most influential economics books in history—Keynes advocated for government intervention as a solution to high unemployment. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 British economist John Maynard Keynes was the founder of Keynesian economics. Keynesian economics argues that demand drives supply. To create jobs and boost consumer buying power during a recession, Keynes held that governments should increase spending, even if it means going into debt. Critics attack Keynesian economics for promoting deficit spending, stifling private investment, and causing inflation. 
 
    Education and Early Career    
  Keynes’ early interest in economics was due in large part to his father, John Neville Keynes, an economics lecturer at Cambridge University. His mother, one of Cambridge's first female graduates, was active in charitable work for the underprivileged. 1 
 
 
  Born into a middle-class family, he received scholarships to two of the most elite schools in England, Eton College and Cambridge University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1904. He excelled at mathematics throughout his academic career, and notably, he had almost no formal training in economics.
 
 
  Early in his career, Keynes worked on probability theory and lectured in economics as a fellow of King's College at Cambridge University. His government roles ranged from official positions in the British Civil Service and the British Treasury to appointments to royal commissions on currency and finance, including his 1919 appointment as the Treasury’s financial representative at the Versailles peace conference that ended World War I. 2

    Advocacy of Government Intervention in the Economy    
  Keynes' father was an advocate of  laissez-faire economics , an economic philosophy of  free-market  capitalism that opposes government intervention. Keynes himself was a conventional believer in the principles of the free market (and an active investor in the stock market) during his time at Cambridge.
 
 
 
 
  However, after the  1929 stock market crash  triggered the  Great Depression , Keynes came to believe that unrestricted free-market capitalism was essentially flawed and needed to be reformulated, not only to function better in its own right but also to outperform competitive systems like communism. 3 
 
 
  As a result, he began advocating for government intervention to curb unemployment and correct economic recession. In addition to government jobs programs, he argued that increased government spending was necessary to decrease unemployment—even if it meant a  budget deficit . 
 
 
    What Is Keynesian Economics?    
  The theories of John Maynard Keynes, known as  Keynesian economics , center around the idea that governments should play an active role in their countries' economies, instead of just letting the free market reign. Specifically, Keynes advocated government spending to mitigate downturns in business cycles.
 
 
  The most basic principle of Keynesian economics is that demand—not supply—is the driving force of an economy. At the time, conventional economic wisdom held the opposite view: that supply creates demand. Because  aggregate demand —the total spending for and consumption of goods and services by the private sector and the government—drives supply, total spending determines all economic outcomes, from the production of goods to the employment rate.
 
 
  Another basic principle of Keynesian economics is that the best way to pull an economy out of a recession is for the government to increase demand by infusing the economy with capital. In short, consumption (spending) is the key to economic recovery. 4 
 
 
  These two principles are the basis of Keynes' belief that demand is so important that, even if a government has to go into debt to spend, it should do so. According to Keynes, the government boosting the economy in this way will stimulate consumer demand, which in turn spurs production and ensures full employment. 
 
 
    Criticism of Keynesian Economics    
  Although widely adopted after World War II, Keynesian economics has attracted plenty of criticism since the ideas were first introduced in the 1930s.

"Creative Destruction: Out With the Old, in With the New","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Creative Destruction?    
  Creative destruction is the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for innovation and is seen as a driving force of  capitalism .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Creative destruction describes the deliberate dismantling of established processes in order to make way for improved methods of production. Creative destruction is most often used to describe disruptive technologies such as the railroads or, in our own time, the internet. The term was coined in the early 1940s by economist Joseph Schumpeter, who observed real-life examples of creative destruction, such as Henry Ford’s assembly line.  Creative destruction can be seen across many different industries such as technology, retail, and finance.  Creative destruction often has unintended consequences such as temporary losses of jobs, environmental issues, or inequity. 
 
    Understanding Creative Destruction    
  The term creative destruction was first coined by Austrian economist  Joseph Schumpeter  in 1942. Schumpeter characterized creative destruction as innovations in the manufacturing process that increase  productivity , describing it as the ""process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.""
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Alison Czinkota 
 
  Basically, the theory of creative destruction assumes that long-standing arrangements and assumptions must be destroyed to free up resources and energy to be deployed for innovation. To Schumpeter, economic development is the natural result of forces internal to the market and is created by the opportunity to seek  profit .
 
 
  Creative destruction theory treats  economics  as an organic and dynamic process. This stands in stark contrast with the static mathematical models of traditional Cambridge-tradition economics.  Equilibrium  is no longer the end goal of market processes. Instead, many fluctuating dynamics are constantly reshaped or replaced by innovation and competition.
 
 
 
 
  As is implied by the word destruction, the process inevitably results in losers and winners. Producers and workers committed to the older technology will be left stranded.  Entrepreneurs  and workers in new technologies, meanwhile, will inevitably create  disequilibrium  and highlight new profit opportunities.
 
 
  In describing creative destruction, Schumpeter was not necessarily endorsing it. In fact, his work is considered to be heavily influenced by  The Communist Manifesto , the pamphlet by  Karl Marx  and Friedrich Engels which decried the bourgeoisie for its ""constant revolutionizing of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions."" 1 ﻿﻿﻿
 
 
   Important 
 Netflix is a modern example of creative destruction, having overthrown disc rental and traditional media industries. 
 
 
 
    Principles of Creative Destruction    
 
 Innovation:  Creative destruction involves the introduction of new ideas, products, and technologies that replace the existing ones. Innovation is the driving force of creative destruction. Without innovation, creative destruction could not exist and without innovators, there would be no change agents that could make creative destruction happen. 
 Competition:  The process of creative destruction involves intense competition between the old and new technologies or products. The new products or technologies must prove to be better and more efficient than the old ones to replace them. For this reason, creative destruction is usually heavily tied to competition and  competitive advantages . Companies usually strive to find the best ways to do things and are often willing to creatively destroy what they've done in the past to find better long-term solutions. 
 Entrepreneurship:  Entrepreneurship is also critical to the process of creative destruction. The entrepreneurs who develop new products and technologies and disrupt existing markets are the agents of creative destruction. They are responsible for overseeing change management, educating both internal staff and consumers on how this change will impact them. Without clear guidance on the intention of the creative destruction, the entrepreneur will likely fail in their attempt to innovate. 
 Capital:  Last, a cornerstone principle of creative destruction is capital. Making sweeping, radical innovate changes is often expensive, and companies must be prepared to take on financial risk to make this change. Most often, companies will seen  venture capital  investments to aid with funding the creative destruction. 
 
 
    Creative Destruction Across Industries    
  Creative destruction can be seen across many different industries. As all companies often strive to be better, many businesses seek new ways to disrupt the status quo and seek new paths to better business opportunity. Some examples of those industries are below.

"All About Fiscal Policy: What It Is, Why It Matters, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Fiscal policy uses tax policies and government spending to influence macroeconomic conditions, including employment and inflation. 
    What Is Fiscal Policy?    
  Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and tax policies to influence  economic conditions , especially  macroeconomic  conditions. These include aggregate demand for goods and services, employment, inflation, and economic growth.
 
 
  During a recession, the government may lower tax rates or increase spending to encourage demand and spur economic activity. Conversely, to combat  inflation , it may raise rates or cut spending to cool down the economy.
 
 
  Fiscal policy is often contrasted with  monetary policy , which is enacted by central bankers and not elected government officials.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions. Fiscal policy is largely based on ideas from British economist John Maynard Keynes. Keynes argued that governments could stabilize the business cycle and regulate economic output rather than let markets right themselves alone. An expansionary fiscal policy lowers tax rates or increases spending to increase aggregate demand and fuel economic growth. A contractionary fiscal policy raises rates or cuts spending to prevent or reduce inflation. 
 
    Understanding Fiscal Policy    
  U.S. fiscal policy is largely based on the ideas of British economist  John Maynard Keynes  (1883-1946). He argued that economic recessions are due to a deficiency in the consumer spending and business investment components of aggregate demand.
 
 
  Keynes believed that governments could stabilize the  business cycle  and regulate economic output by adjusting spending and tax policies to make up for the shortfalls of the private sector. 1

  His theories were developed in response to the Great Depression, which defied classical economics' assumptions that economic swings were self-correcting. Keynes' ideas were highly influential and led to the  New Deal  in the U.S., which involved massive spending on public works projects and social welfare programs.
 
 
  In  Keynesian economics , aggregate demand or spending is what drives the performance and growth of the economy.  Aggregate demand  is made up of consumer spending, business investment spending, net government spending, and net exports.
 
 
    Variable Private Sector Behavior    
  According to Keynesian economists, the private sector components of aggregate demand are too variable and too dependent on psychological and emotional factors to maintain sustained growth in the economy. 1 
 
 
  Pessimism, fear, and uncertainty among consumers and businesses can lead to economic recessions and depressions. What's more, excessive public sector exuberance during good times can lead to an overheated economy and inflation.
 
 
  However, Keynesians believe that government taxation and spending can be managed rationally and used to counteract the excesses and deficiencies of private sector consumption and investment spending in order to stabilize the economy. 1 
 
 
    Corrective Government Fiscal Action    
  When private sector spending decreases, the government can spend more or tax less in order to directly increase aggregate demand. When the private sector is overly optimistic and spends too much, too quickly on consumption and new investment projects, the government can spend less or tax more in order to decrease aggregate demand. 
 
 
  This means that to help stabilize the economy, the government should run large budget deficits during economic downturns and run budget surpluses when the economy is growing. These are known as  expansionary  or  contractionary  fiscal policies, respectively.  
 
 
   Fiscal Policy Example 
 During the Great Depression of the 1930s, U.S. unemployment exceeded 20%. The misery seemed endless. President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to put an expansionary fiscal policy into effect. He launched his New Deal soon after taking office. It created new government agencies, the  WPA  jobs program, and the Social Security program, which exists to this day. These spending efforts, combined with his continued expansionary policy spending during World War II, pulled the country out of the Depression. 2 
 
    Types of Fiscal Policies    
    Expansionary Policy and Tools    
  To illustrate how the government can use fiscal policy to affect the economy, consider an economy that's experiencing a  recession . The government might issue tax stimulus rebates to increase  aggregate demand  and fuel economic growth.

How to Use Interpersonal Skills to Get and Keep a Job,"Definition 
 Interpersonal skills are the behaviors and tactics a person uses to interact with others effectively. 
    What Are Interpersonal Skills?    
  Interpersonal skills are the behaviors and tactics a person uses to interact with others effectively. People use interpersonal skills all the time when dealing with others, whether in the workplace, in social situations, or within a family.
 
 
  In the business world, the term generally refers to an employee's ability to work well with others.  Interpersonal skills  range from ways of communicating and listening to attitude and deportment.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Interpersonal skills are behaviors we use to interact with others effectively on the job and in the larger world. 
 Some people are born with good interpersonal skills but everyone can learn, develop and improve them. 
 Expressing appreciation, resolving disputes, and listening well are all interpersonal skills worth practicing. 
 Excellent interpersonal skills in the workplace can enhance camaraderie, improve working results, and support  career development .

   Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight 
 
    Understanding Interpersonal Skills    
  Interpersonal skills are often referred to as people skills, social skills, or social intelligence. They involve reading the signals that others send and interpreting them accurately in order to form effective responses. Individuals show their interpersonal skills all the time simply by interacting with others.
 
 
  Everyone has a personal style and an interpersonal style. Some people are more successful than others at using interpersonal skills for specific, desired results. Interpersonal skills may be based in part on  personality  and instinct. However, good ones can also be introduced to people and improved upon.
 
 
 
 
  While interpersonal skills can be developed, they cannot be learned solely from a textbook. For some people, they should be practiced, used daily, observed, and then tweaked. That is to say, these skills may come naturally to certain individuals, but others have to work at cultivating them. This cultivation often happens through continuous interaction with other individuals.
 
 
  In many organizations, employees with strong interpersonal skills are valued for their pleasant demeanor and positive, solution-oriented attitude.
 
 
  These employees are seen as team players who work well with others to achieve a goal. In more human terms, everyone likes being around them. That's a welcome attribute in any social interaction, including those involving work.
 
 
  Interpersonal skills are strongly linked to a knowledge of social expectations and customs, whether that knowledge is inherent or learned. People with the strongest interpersonal skills adjust their tactics and communications as needed, depending on the reactions of others to their messages and meanings.
 
 
  Those without good interpersonal skills can still  succeed in business  if they are allowed to work in areas that don't require regular interactions with a variety of people. These areas might include research, development, coding, and system testing.
 
 
    Examples of Interpersonal Skills    
  The many types of interpersonal skills that can lead to great outcomes at work include:
 
 
   Clear communication, whether you're explaining an idea or asking a question in person, in writing, or by phone Attentive, careful listening Confirming that you comprehend what you've heard from a colleague or customer Empathetic behavior that shows you understand and care about a colleague's situation Supporting the useful ideas and honest efforts of colleagues Responding positively to communications from others Presenting a willingness to get a job done Building relationships Being positive 
 
 
    Benefits of Interpersonal Skills    
  The importance of solid, properly-used interpersonal skills in the workplace can't be overstated. Their benefits provide advantages for individual employees and companies as a whole. These benefits can include: 
 
 
   Better camaraderie Increased trust and dependability More and better creativity through successful collaboration Effective and efficient task completion More enthusiasm for a particular task or job Elimination of unnecessary problems Greater productivity Opportunities for greater exposure to different, positive experiences with other employees or clients Opportunities to display qualities of leadership Opportunities for promotions The growth of a reliable professional network that can help build a career

 Porter’s Five Forces are used to identify and analyze the forces that shape the competitive nature and intensity of a market or industry. 
    What Are Porter's Five Forces?    
  Porter's Five Forces is a tool used to analyze a market or industry and determine its competitiveness. These five forces were developed by Harvard business professor Michael Porter who wrote about the strategic analysis model in the  Harvard Business Review in  1979. 1  The five forces are: internal competition, the potential for new entrants, the negotiating power of suppliers, the negotiating power of customers, and the ability of customers to find substitutes. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Porter's Five Forces are used to identify and analyze an industry's competitive forces. The five forces are competition, the threat of new entrants to the industry, supplier bargaining power, customer bargaining power, and the ability of customers to find product substitutes. Businesses can use the model to determine the intensity of competition and potential profitability, helping them better understand where power lies in their sector. Porter's model was meant to critique perfectly competitive business models, unlike real-world markets where competitors aren't just rivals. Critics of the model say it's too static and doesn't apply as well to quick-changing markets among other things.

    Understanding Porter's Five Forces    
  When Porter's article was published, strategic models loved acronyms (SWOT, PEST, PESTEL, BCG Matrix, ETPS, etc.) and focused on the internal dynamics of individual companies. 2  But, they were vague in their exploration of the competitive business environment. For instance, the opportunities and threats of  SWOT  analysis were too macro for many dealing with specific industry challenges.
 
 
  Porter's 1979 article was also a broadside against the theoretical models found in the curriculums of the major business schools, where future strategists dealt with a  perfectly competitive  market characterized by equilibrium and no specific firm influencing prices—a model they were unlikely to find in the real world.
 
 
  The first sentence of Porter's 1979 article could hardly be less controversial: ""The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition."" 1  It's the following sentence that, in its understated way, would prove far more consequential: ""Yet it is easy to view competition too narrowly and too pessimistically."" 1 
 
 
 
 
  Rather than viewing competition narrowly as rivalry among existing competitors, which is his first force, Porter expanded the concept to include four others: the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, the threat of new entrants, and the threat of substitute products or services.

 Definition 
 Return on equity (ROE) is a financial performance ratio that demonstrates how it uses shareholders' equity to generate net income. 
    What Is Return on Equity (ROE)?    
  Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of a company's financial performance. It is calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is a way of showing a company's return on net assets.
 
 
  Return on equity is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the more efficient a company's management is at generating income and growth from its equity financing.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 To calculate return on equity (ROE), divide a company's net income by its shareholders' equity. ROE is a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the better a company is at converting its equity financing into profits. ROE will vary based on the sector a company is in, so it provides the most accurate information when it's used to compare companies in the same industry. A shortcut to assessing return on equity is to compare it to the current long-term average of the S&P 500. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    How Return on Equity (ROE) Works    
  ROE is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company. Net income is calculated before dividends paid to common shareholders, after dividends to preferred shareholders, and after interest to lenders.
 
 
  Whether an ROE is deemed good or bad will depend on what is normal among a stock’s peers. For example, utilities have many assets and debt on the balance sheet compared to a relatively small amount of net income. A normal ROE in the utility sector could be 10% or less. A technology or retail firm with smaller balance sheet accounts relative to net income may have normal ROE levels of 18% or more.
 
 
 
 
  A good rule of thumb is to look for return on equity that is equal to or just above the average for the company's sector—those in the same business. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the past few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo’s management is above average at using the company’s assets to create profits.

  Relatively high or low ROE ratios will vary significantly from one industry group or sector to another. However, a common shortcut for investors is to consider anything less than 10% a poor return on equity and anything near the long-term average of the S&P 500 acceptable.
 
 
    Calculating Return on Equity (ROE)    
  It is considered best practice to calculate ROE based on average equity over a period because of the mismatch between the income statement and the balance sheet. ROE is calculated by comparing the proportion of net income against the amount of shareholder equity. The equation is: 
 ROE = Net Income Shareholders’ Equity \begin{aligned}\textbf{ROE}=\frac{\textbf{Net Income}}{\textbf{Shareholders' Equity}}\end{aligned} ROE = Shareholders’ Equity Net Income ​ ​

10 Timeless Rules for Investors,"Close 
 
 
 
  Bob Farrell spent decades as the head of research at Merrill Lynch, establishing himself as one of the leading market analysts on Wall Street. His insights on  technical analysis  and general market tendencies were canonized as ""10 Market Rules to Remember"" and have been distributed widely ever since. Here, we review these timeless axioms and how they can help you achieve better returns.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Investors should keep in mind that prices never stay the same and corrections are inevitable.  Excesses are never permanent and try using stops to take the emotion out of trading. Don't go with the herd, but remember that fear and greed need to take a backseat to discipline.  Consider alternative indexes to watch the health of the market. Take expert advice and forecasts with a grain of salt. 
 
    1. Markets Return to the Mean Over Time    
  Whether they face extreme optimism or pessimism, markets eventually revert to saner, long-term valuation levels. According to this theory, returns and prices will go back to whence they came— reversion  generally puts the market back to a previous state. So when it comes to individual investors, the lesson is clear: Make a plan and stick to it. Try to weigh out the importance of everything else that's going on around you and use your best judgment. Don't get thrown by the daily chatter and turmoil of the marketplace. 
 
 
    2. Excess Leads to an Opposite Excess    
  Like a swerving automobile driven by an inexperienced youth, we can expect overcorrection when markets overshoot. Remember, a  correction  is represented by a move of more than 10% of an asset's peak price, so an overcorrection can mean bigger movements. During a market crash, investors are presented with really great buying opportunities. But they tend overcorrect in either direction—upward or downward—and trading can happen at unbelievable levels. Tuned-in investors will be wary of this and will possess the patience and know-how to take measured action to safeguard their  capital .   
 
 
    3. Excesses Are Never Permanent    
  The tendency among even the most successful investors is to believe that when things are moving in their favor, profits are limitless. That's just not true, and nothing lasts forever—especially in the financial world. Whether you're riding market lows which represent buying opportunities, or soaring at highs so they can make money by selling, don't count your chickens before they've all hatched. After all, you may have to make a move at some point, because as the first two rules indicate,  markets  revert to the mean.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Markets always revert to the mean. 
 
 
 
    4. Market Corrections Don't Go Sideways    
  Sharply moving markets tend to correct sharply, which can prevent investors from contemplating their next move in tranquility. The lesson here is to be decisive in trading fast-moving markets and to place stops on your trades to avoid emotional responses.   
 
 
   Stop orders  help traders in two ways when asset prices move beyond a particular point. By determining a specific entry or exit point, they can help investors limit the amount of money they lose, or help them lock in a profit when prices swing in either direction.
 
 
    5. Public Buys Most at the Top and Least at the Bottom    
  The typical investor reads the latest news on their mobile phone, watches market programs, and believes what they're told. Unfortunately, by the time the financial press gets around to reporting a given price move, that move is already complete and a  reversion  is usually in progress. This is precisely the moment when John Q decides to buy at the top or sell at the bottom.
 
 
  The need to be a  contrarian  is underlined by this rule. Independent thinking always outperforms the herd mentality.

    6. Fear and Greed: Stronger Than Long-Term Resolve    
  Basic human emotion is perhaps the greatest enemy of successful investing. But whether you're a long-term investor or a day trader, a disciplined approach to trading is key to profits. You must have a  trading plan  with every trade. You must know exactly at what level you are a  seller  of your stock—on the upside and the down.
 
 
  Knowing when to get out of a trade is far more difficult than knowing when to get in. Knowing when to take a profit or cut a loss is very easy to figure in the abstract, but when you're holding a security that's on a quick move, fear and greed act quickly to separate you from reality and your money.
 
 
    7. Markets: Strong When Broad, Weak When Narrow    
  While there's much to be gained from a focus on popular index averages, the strength of a market move is determined by the underlying strength of the market as a whole. So  broader averages  offer a better take on the strength of the market. That's why it can pay off to follow","By

Spreads in Finance: The Multiple Meanings in Trading Explained,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A bid price is the most a buyer is willing to pay, an ask price is the least a seller is willing to accept, and the spread is the difference between them. 
    What Is a Spread?    
  Few terms in finance are as potentially confusing as ""spread."" The word carries many meanings, and each is critical to understanding market dynamics and investing strategies. Spreads are important to know for nearly every aspect of financial markets, from the difference between bid and ask prices to more complex options strategies.
 
 
  A spread in finance typically refers to some form of difference or gap between two related values. In stock trading, the spread generally refers to the gap between buying and selling prices. In bonds, it indicates the yield differential between two securities. Options traders use spreads to create sophisticated risk management strategies, while forex traders focus on currency pair differences.
 
 
  Understanding these various types of spreads is crucial for anyone looking to navigate financial markets effectively. They impact the cost of trading and provide a greater understanding of market liquidity, risk, and potential profit opportunities. Below, we remove any confusion among these meanings while detaining their importance for investors.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The term ""spread"" in finance generally refers to a difference between two related values, but its specific meaning varies across markets and trading contexts. In stock trading, the bid-ask spread is the gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, serving as an indicator of liquidity. Bond spreads typically measure the yield difference between two securities, often used to assess relative risk or value between fixed-income investments. In options trading, spreads refer to strategies involving multiple options contracts and are designed to manage risk or speculate on price movements with a more limited downside. 
 
    Understanding Spreads    
  Spreads are the lifeblood of financial markets. They tell us about liquidity, risk appetite, and market efficiency all at once. Let's describe the major types in turn in the order we discuss them below:
 
 
 
 
 
 Securities : The most common spread is the bid-ask spread. This is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask). A narrow spread for stocks often indicates high liquidity and low transaction costs, while a wider spread suggests the opposite. Spreads can also refer to the gap between a short position (selling) in one futures contract or currency and a long position (buying) in another. This is officially known as a spread trade. 
 Bond market spreads : Bond yields spreads to measure the yield difference between two securities. The most well-known is the  yield spread , which compares the interest rates of two bonds with different credit qualities or maturities. For instance, the spread between U.S. Treasury bonds and corporate bonds of the same maturity reveals the added yield investors demand for taking on the higher risk of corporate debt. 
 Lending : Spread refers to a borrower's price above a benchmark yield to get a loan. For example, if the prime interest rate is 3%, and a borrower receives a mortgage charging a 5% rate, the spread is 2%. From the institution's point of view, it's the difference between the interest rate it charges on loans and the interest rate it pays on deposits. This spread is a primary source of profit for banks and other lending institutions. 1 
 Options trading : Spreads have a different meaning in options altogether. Here, spreads refer to strategies involving multiple options contracts. These strategies, such as  bull spreads  or butterfly spreads, allow traders to fine-tune their risk exposure. 
 Foreign exchange (forex) markets : Here, spreads represent the difference between currency pairs' buy and sell prices. These spreads can fluctuate based on market volatility and liquidity. 
 
 
 
 
    1. Stock Market Spreads    
    Bid-Ask Spreads    
  Most  securities  sell in a two-sided market, such as most stocks, where there is a  bid-ask spread  that marks the difference between the highest bid price and the lowest offer. The bid-ask spread is often used to help assess a stock's liquidity.
 
 
  For instance, in the stock market, a highly liquid stock like Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) may have a hypothetical bid price of $150.00 and an ask price of $150.02, resulting in a spread of just $0.02. This tight spread suggests a highly liquid market with many buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, a thinly traded stock, like a small-cap company, might have a bid price of $10.00 and an ask price of $10.50, resulting in a much larger spread of $0.50.
 
 
  This wider spread shows lower liquidity, higher volatility, and greater transaction costs for traders. The bid-ask spread is crucial for  high-frequen","By

 Operating margin is a company's profit for every dollar of sales after deducting production costs like wages and raw materials but before accounting for interest and taxes. 
    What Is Operating Margin?    
  A company's operating margin is the amount it makes on every dollar of sales after deducting the  variable costs  involved but before accounting for interest or taxes. Operating margin is calculated by dividing the company’s operating income by its  net sales .
 
 
  A higher ratio in an operating margin is generally better, as it indicates the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A company's operating margin indicates how effective it is at generating a profit through its core operations. The formula for operating margin yields the percentage profit made on each dollar of sales. Operating margin is reduced by the company's variable costs of production but does not consider the costs of interest or taxes (EBIT). To calculate operating margin, divide operating income (earnings) by sales (revenues). 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A higher operating margin indicates a more efficient and profitable business. 
 Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Understanding Operating Margin    
  A company’s operating margin, sometimes referred to as  return on sales  (ROS), is a good indicator of how well it is being managed and how efficient it is at generating profits from sales. It shows the proportion of revenues that are available to cover non-operating costs, such as paying  interest , which is why investors and lenders pay close attention to it.
 
 
  Highly variable operating margins are a prime indicator of business risk. By the same token, looking at a company’s past operating margins is a good way to gauge whether a company's performance has been getting better. The operating margin can improve through better management controls, more efficient use of resources, improved pricing, and more effective marketing.
 
 
 
 
  In its essence, the operating margin is how much profit a company makes from its core business in relation to its total revenues. This allows investors to see if a company is generating income primarily from its core operations or from other means, such as investing.

    Calculating Operating Margin    
  The formula for operating margin is:
 
 
   Operating Margin = Operating Earnings Revenue \begin{aligned} \text{Operating Margin}=\frac{\text{Operating Earnings}}{\text{Revenue}} \end{aligned} Operating Margin = Revenue Operating Earnings ​ ​ ﻿﻿
 
 
  When calculating operating margin, the numerator uses a firm's  earnings before interest and taxes  (EBIT). EBIT, or  operating earnings , is calculated simply as revenue minus  cost of goods sold  (COGS) and the regular selling, general, and administrative costs of running a business, excluding interest and taxes.
 
 
    Example    
  For example, if a company had revenues of $2 million, COGS of $700,000, and  administrative expenses  of $500,000, its operating earnings would be $2 million - ($700,000 + $500,000) = $800,000. Its operating margin would then be $800,000 / $2 million = 40%.

X-Efficiency: Meaning and History in Economics,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 X-efficiency measures how effectively a firm uses its inputs to maximize outputs under conditions of imperfect competition. 
    What Is X-Efficiency?    
  X-efficiency refers to the degree of efficiency maintained by firms under conditions of imperfect competition. Efficiency in this context means a company getting the maximum outputs from its inputs, including employee productivity and manufacturing efficiency.
 
 
  In a highly competitive market, firms are forced to be as efficient as possible to ensure strong profits and continued existence. This is not true in situations of imperfect competition, such as with a  monopoly  or  duopoly .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 X-efficiency is the degree of efficiency maintained by firms under conditions of imperfect competition such as the case of a monopoly. Economist Harvey Leibenstein challenged the belief that firms were always rational and called this anomaly ""X"" for unknown–or x-efficiency. Leibenstein introduced the human element, arguing that there could be degrees of efficiency, meaning that–at times–firms didn't always maximize profits 1 ﻿ 
 
    Understanding X-Efficiency    
  X-efficiency points to irrational actions in the market by firms. Traditional neoclassical economics made the assumption that companies operated in rational ways, meaning they maximized production at the lowest possible costs–even when the markets were not efficient. Harvey Leibenstein, a Harvard professor and economist, challenged the belief that firms were always rational and called this anomaly ""X"" for unknown–or x-efficiency. In the absence of real competition, companies are more tolerant of inefficiencies in their operations. The concept of x-efficiency is used to estimate how much more efficient a company would be in a more competitive environment. 1 ﻿﻿
 
 
  Born in the Ukraine, Harvey Leibenstein (1922-1994) was a professor at Harvard University whose primary contribution—other than x-efficiency and its various applications to economic development, property rights, entrepreneurs, and bureaucracy—was the critical minimum effort theory that aimed to find a solution to breaking the poverty cycle in underdeveloped countries.
 
 
 
 
  When calculating x-efficiency, a data point is usually selected to represent an industry and then it is modeled using  regression-analysis . For example, a bank might be judged by total costs divided by total assets to get a single data point for a firm. Then, the data points for all the banks would be compared using regression analysis to identify the most x-efficient and where the majority fall. This analysis can be done for a specific country to find out how x-efficient certain sectors are or across borders for a particular sector to see the regional and jurisdictional variations.
 
 
    History of X-Efficiency    
  Leibenstein proposed the concept of x-efficiency in a 1966 paper titled ""Allocative Efficiency vs. 'X-Efficiency,'"" which appeared in The American Economic Review.  Allocative efficiency  is when a company's marginal costs are equal to price and can occur when the competition is very high in that industry. Prior to 1966, economists believed that firms were efficient with the exception of circumstances of allocative efficiency. Leibenstein introduced the human element whereby factors could exist, attributable to management or workers, that don't maximize production or achieve the lowest possible costs in production.
 
 
  In the summary section of the paper, Leibenstein asserted that ""microeconomic theory focuses on allocative efficiency to the exclusion of other types of efficiencies that are much more significant in many instances. Furthermore, improvement in 'non-allocative efficiency' is an important aspect of the process of growth."" Leibenstein concluded that the  theory of the firm  does not depend on cost-minimization; rather, unit costs are influenced by x-efficiency, which in turn, ""depends on the degree of competitive pressure, as well as other motivational factors.""
 
 
  In the extreme market structure case–monopoly—Leibenstein observed less worker effort. In other words, with no competition, there is less worker and management desire to maximize production and compete. On the other hand, when competitive pressures were high, workers exerted more effort. Leibenstein argued that there is much more to gain for a firm and its profit-making ways by increasing x-efficiency instead of allocative efficiency.
 
 
  The theory of x-efficiency was controversial when it was introduced because it conflicted with the assumption of utility-maximizing behavior, a well-accepted axiom in economic theory.  Utility  is essentially the benefit or satisfaction from a behavior, such as consuming a product.
 
 
   Important 
 X-efficiency helps to explain why companies might have little motivation to maximize profits in a market where the company is already profitable and faces little threat from competitors.","By

 Xetra is a trading technology platform operated by the Deutsche Börse Group. Launched in 1997, the platform accounts for more than 90% of all trading in shares at all German exchanges. Xetra was one of the first global electronic trade systems and still lists the DAX. It offers increased flexibility for seeing order depth within the markets, and it offers trading in stocks, funds, bonds, warrants, and commodities contracts. Trading activity takes place between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. local time Monday to Friday, except for major holidays. 
 
    Understanding Xetra    
  As mentioned above, Xetra is a fully electronic trading platform. Headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, the exchange is operated by Deutsche Börse Group, which also owns the  Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA)  or Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse. 1  Deutsche Börse Group is a diversified organization with a range of products and services that span the financial industry’s value chain. This includes listing, trading, clearing, and settlement, along with custody services, liquidity management, and more.
 
 
  Xetra launched in 1997 and was one of the first global electronic trading systems and has grown to account for the majority of all stock  trades  on the FRA. In fact, more than 90% of all share trading in Germany takes place through Xetra. This is on top of about 30% of all ETF trading that takes place in continental Europe. 2 
 
 
  The Xetra platform offers increased flexibility for seeing order depth within the markets. And because it is a completely electronic platform, it offers investors a trading platform with low costs and high  transparency  as well as fast turnaround times for their orders. This is especially true for shares that are highly traded, including those that are on the  DAX . This index represents 40 of the biggest and most liquid German companies that trade on the FRA. 1 
 
 
 
 
  Trading on the Xetra electronic platform takes place Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time. There is no trading activity on major holidays. The platform hosts an opening auction daily at 8:50 a.m and a closing auction at 5:30 p.m. 3

    Xetra vs. Other Electronic Trading Systems    
  Xetra may be one of the largest  electronic trading  systems in the world, but it certainly isn't the only one and wasn't the first to offer the ease of automated trading.
 
 
  The first automated system for direct trading among U.S. institutions was launched in 1969 and was called  Instinet  (originally named Institutional Networks). 5   Nasdaq  followed with its own automated system in 1971. 6  Trade orders were made on these and other similar systems over the phone.
 
 
  The  New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  launched its  Designated Order Turnaround (DOT)  system, which allowed brokers to route orders directly to specialists on the floor. In 1984, SuperDOT emerged, which effectively expanded the number of shares sent to the floor at one time to nearly 100,000. Nasdaq soon offered the  Small Order Execution System (SOES)  to compete with NYSE.
 
 
  Electronic trading is fairly common in today's financial industry. It dominates the public markets over physical trading activity, thanks to the rise of internet technology. In fact, very few exchanges offer trading on a physical trading floor. Instead, the majority of trading takes place globally on electronic platforms like Xetra. But there are risks—notably, greater  cybersecurity  threats.
 
 
  While individuals remain at some level of cyber-attack risk, larger entities such as businesses and government systems are often the main targets of cybersecurity attacks. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses high-tech cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive government information from other countries, nation-states, and individual hackers. Any financial system that stores credit card information from its users is at high risk, along with systems like exchanges.

The Top 5 Ways to Hedge Against Inflation,"Close 
 
 
 
  Inflation is defined by the rate at which the value of a currency is falling and, consequently, the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.  Inflation  is a natural occurrence in an economy, but  inflation hedging  can be used to offset the anticipated drop in a currency's price, thus protecting the decreased purchasing power.
 
 
  Inflation hedging can also help protect the value of an investment. Although certain investments may seem to provide a decent return, they can be sold at a loss when inflation is factored in.
 
 
  A disciplined investor can plan for inflation by cultivating asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary climates. Although traditional bonds are the usual go-to for the income-oriented, they aren't the only investment that produces a revenue stream.
 
 
  Here are the top five asset classes to consider when seeking protection from inflation. They range from equities to debt instruments to alternative investments. All are feasible moves for the individual investor to make, though they carry different degrees of risk.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Inflation is a natural occurrence in an economy, and a disciplined investor can plan for it by cultivating asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary climates. Shifting funds from bonds to stocks, especially preferred shares, is one strategy. Real estate usually performs well in inflationary climates; REITs are the most feasible way to invest. Adding global stocks or bonds to your portfolio also hedges your portfolio against domestic inflationary cycles. Another option is more exotic debt instruments like TIPS (inflation-adjusted Treasury bonds). Buying senior secured bank loans is another way to earn higher yields while protecting yourself from a price drop if rates start to rise. 
 
    1. Reallocate Money Into Stocks    
  If inflation returns, it's generally a punch in the jaw for the bond market, but it could be a shot in the arm for the stock market. Consider reallocating 10% of your portfolio from bonds to equities in order to take advantage of this possible trend.
 
 
 
 
  A 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is considered to be a safe, conservative mix of stocks and bonds. An example of a stock/bond portfolio is the Dimensional DFA Global Allocation 60/40 Portfolio (I) (DGSIX). 
 
 
   Note 
 A 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is an easy investment strategy and will help you hedge against inflation, but keep in mind it will underperform over the long term compared to an all-equity portfolio because of the effects of compounding interest. You may find yourself missing out on returns compared to a portfolio with a higher percentage of stocks. 
 
  Buying  preferred stocks  is another possibility. These  liquid  issues will pay a higher yield than most types of bonds and may not decline in price as much as bonds when inflation appears.
 
 
  Utility stocks represent a third alternative, where the price of the stock will rise and fall in a somewhat predictable fashion through the economic cycle and also pay steady dividends.
 
 
    2. Diversify Internationally    
  American investors tend to  lean towards stocks and bonds in the U.S. , but the practice can be costly over the long term, especially during times of inflation. Increasing international exposure can be a good strategy to hedge against inflation.
 
 
  Several major economies in the world do not rise and fall in tandem with the U.S. market indices, such as Italy, Australia, and South Korea. Adding stocks from these or other similar countries can help hedge your portfolio against domestic economic cycles. Bonds from foreign issuers can provide investors with exposure to fixed income that may not drop in price if inflation appears on the home front. 1 
 
 
   Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)  and  mutual funds  are two of the easiest options to  diversify investments into international markets . These types of funds are a low-cost way to invest, compared to purchasing a portfolio of  American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)  or foreign stocks. If you hold S&P 500 index funds, you may want to consider adding an international index fund to your portfolio.
 
 
    3. Consider Real Estate    
  There are many advantages to investing in real estate. This asset class has intrinsic value and provides consistent income through dividends. It often acts as a good inflation hedge since there will always be a demand for homes, regardless of the economic climate, and because as inflation rises, so do property values, and therefore the amount a landlord can charge for rent. 
 
 
  Because real estate is a tangible asset, however, it's illiquid. An alternative to consider is  real estate investment trusts (REITs) , which are more liquid investments and can be bought and sold easily in the markets. REITs are companies that own and operate portfolios of commercial, residential, and industrial properties.

"Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC): Definition, Taxes, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC) is a deferred annuity that allows fund conversions from a qualified retirement plan or IRA into guaranteed future monthly payments. 
    What Is a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)?    
  QLAC stands for qualified longevity annuity contract. It's a  deferred annuity  funded with an investment from a  qualified retirement plan  or an  individual retirement account (IRA) . A QLAC allows funds in a qualified retirement plan, such as a 401(k), a 403(b), or an IRA, to be converted into an annuity.
 
 
  QLACs are available for purchase through many insurance companies.
 
 
  A QLAC provides guaranteed monthly payments that begin after the specified annuity starting date. As long as the QLAC complies with  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  requirements, it is exempt from  required minimum distribution (RMD)  rules until the owner reaches age 85. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A QLAC is a retirement strategy in which a portion of required minimum distributions (RMDs) are deferred. The SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 allows individuals to move $200,000 from a qualified retirement plan or IRA to a QLAC. A QLAC allows taxes to be deferred that are normally required by RMDs. QLACs are available for purchase through many insurance companies.

  An annuity is a contract purchased from an insurance company in which the buyer pays a lump sum or a series of premiums. The insurance company pays the  annuitant  beginning on a predetermined start date. How many years the owner receives payments depends on the type of annuity purchased.
 
 
  The  SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022  allows individuals to move $200,000 to a qualified longevity annuity contract. It adjusts the $200,000 limit annually for inflation, and the legislation removed the rule capping QLAC premiums at 25% of the participant’s total plan assets. 2 
 
 
  A QLAC provides a lifetime income once the preset annuity start date is reached. The longer an individual lives, the longer a QLAC pays out. Using IRA funds to purchase a QLAC helps avoid violating the IRS RMD rules mandating a  minimum amount to be annually withdrawn  from an individual’s retirement account balances beginning at age 73 and increasing to age 75 in 2033. 3 
 
 
  A QLAC allows distributions to be delayed until a predetermined payout date but no later than the person’s 85th birthday. A QLAC also allows a spouse or other party to be a joint annuitant where both named individuals are covered with the same conditions regardless of how long they live.
 
 
   85 
 The maximum age to which QLAC funds may be deferred 
 
    QLACs and Taxes    
  QLACs have the added benefit of reducing an individual’s RMDs, which IRAs and qualified retirement plans require. Limiting RMDs can help keep a retiree in a lower tax bracket, with a tax benefit and reduced Medicare premium.
 
 
  Once QLAC income begins, an individual’s tax liability will increase. The annual distribution is based on the account’s value at the end of the preceding year. The promised benefit of QLACs can only be achieved if rules set by the IRS are followed. 1 
 
 
    QLAC Options    
  One option to benefit from QLACs is by  laddering  them and purchasing one QLAC each year for several years. Such a strategy is similar to  dollar-cost averaging , which considers that annuity costs can fluctuate along with interest rates. In other words, a QLAC could be purchased each year, lowering the average cost of the contracts.
 
 
  All laddered annuity contracts can be structured to begin paying out in the same year. Each contract could also have its payouts staggered to pay out in different years based on the owner’s age and when the income is needed. The first QLAC purchased could begin paying out at age 78, the next at age 79, and continue. However, RMDs are required at age 85.
 
 
  QLAC buyers can add a cost-of-living adjustment to their contract, which indexes the annuity against inflation. Deciding on this depends on life expectancy, as the cost-of-living adjustment will reduce the QLAC’s initial payout.
 
 
   Warning 
 The greatest risk of buying a QLAC is the financial strength of the issuing company.

"Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS): Formula, Examples and Benefits","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)?    
  A zero-coupon inflation swap (ZCIS) is a type of  derivative  in which a fixed-rate payment on a notional amount is exchanged for a payment at the rate of inflation. It is an exchange of cash flows that allows investors to either reduce or increase their exposure to the changes in the purchasing power of money.
 
 
  A ZCIS is sometimes known as a breakeven inflation swap.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A zero-coupon inflation swap (ZCIS) is a type of inflation derivative where an income stream tied to the inflation rate is exchanged for an income stream with a fixed interest rate. A ZCIS pays both income streams as a single lump sum when the swap reaches maturity, and the inflation level is known instead of exchanging periodic payments. As inflation rises, the inflation buyer receives more from the inflation seller than what they paid. Conversely, if inflation falls, the inflation buyer receives less from the inflation seller than what they paid. 
 
    Understanding a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)    
  An  inflation swap  is a contract that transfers inflation risk from one party to another through an exchange of fixed cash flows. A ZCIS is a basic type of inflation derivative, where an income stream tied to the inflation rate is exchanged for an income stream with a fixed interest rate. A  zero-coupon  security does not make periodic interest payments during the life of the investment. Instead, a lump sum is paid on the  maturity date  to the security holder.
 
 
  Likewise, with a ZCIS, both income streams are paid as one lump-sum payment when the swap reaches maturity and the inflation level is known. The payoff at maturity depends on the  inflation rate  realized over a given period, as measured by an inflation index. In effect, the ZCIS is a bilateral contract used to provide a  hedge  against inflation.
 
 
   Important 
 While payment is typically exchanged at the end of the swap term, a buyer may choose to sell the swap on the  over-the-counter (OTC)  market prior to maturity. 
 
 
 
  Under a ZCIS, the inflation receiver, or buyer, pays a predetermined fixed rate and, in return, receives an inflation-linked payment from the inflation payer or seller. The side of the contract that pays a fixed rate is referred to as the fixed leg, while the other end of the derivatives contract is the inflation leg. The fixed rate is called the breakeven swap rate, even though the two parties may not actually end up with even payouts.
 
 
 
 
  The payments from both legs capture the difference between expected and actual inflation. If actual inflation exceeds expected inflation, the resulting positive return to the buyer is considered a  capital gain . As inflation rises, the buyer earns more; if inflation falls, the buyer earns less.
 
 
    Computing the Price of a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)    
  The inflation buyer pays a fixed amount, known as the fixed leg. This is: 
 
 Fixed Leg = A × [ ( 1 + r ) t − 1 ] \begin{aligned}\text{Fixed Leg}=A\times[(1+r)^t-1]\end{aligned} Fixed Leg = A × [ ( 1 + r ) t − 1 ] ​ 
 
 The inflation seller pays an amount given by the change in the inflation index, known as the inflation leg. This is: 
 Inflation Leg = A × [ ( I E ÷ I S ) − 1 ] where: A = Reference notional of the swap r = The fixed rate t = The number of years I E = Inflation index at the end (maturity) date I S = Inflation index at the start date \begin{aligned}&\text{Inflation Leg}=A\times[(\text{I}_{\text{E}}\div \text{I}_{\text{S}})-1]\\&\textbf{where:}\\&A=\text{Reference notional of the swap}\\&r=\text{The fixed rate}\\&t=\text{The number of years}\\&\text{I}_{\text{E}}=\text{Inflation index at the end (maturity) date}\\&\text{I}_{\text{S}}=\text{Inflation index at the start date}\end{aligned} ​ Inflation Leg = A × [ ( I E ​ ÷ I S ​ ) − 1 ] where: A = Reference notional of the swap r = The fixed rate t = The number of years I E ​ = Inflation index at the end (maturity) date I S ​ = Inflation index at the start date ​ 
 
 
    Example of a Zero-Coupon Inflation Swap (ZCIS)    
  Assume that two parties enter into a five-year ZCIS with a notional amount of $100 million, a 2.4% fixed rate, and the agreed-upon inflation index, such as the  Consumer Price Index (CPI) , at 2.0% when the swap is agreed upon. At maturity, the inflation index is at 2.5%. 
 Fixed Leg = $ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 × [ ( 1 . 0 2 4 ) 5 − 1 ) ] = $ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 × [ 1 . 1 2 5 8 9 9 9 − 1 ] = $ 1 2 , 5 8 9 , 9 9 0 . 6 8 Inflation Leg = $ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 × [ ( 0 . 0 2 5 ÷ 0 . 0 2 0 ) − 1 ] = $ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 × [ 1 . 2 5 − 1 ] = $ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . 0 0 \begin{aligned}\text{Fixed Leg}&=\$100,000,000\times[(1.024)^5-1)]\\&=\$100,000,000\times[1.1258999-1]\\&=\$12,589,990.68\\\text{Inflation Leg}&=\$100,000,000\times[(0.025\div0.020)-1]\\&=\$100,000,000\times[1.25-1]\\&=\$25,000,000.00 \end{aligned} Fixed Leg Inflation Leg ​ = $ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 × [ (","By

What Is Liquidation?,"What Is Liquidation?    
  Liquidation in finance and economics is the process of bringing a business to an end and distributing its assets to claimants. It is an event that usually occurs when a company is  insolvent , meaning it cannot pay its obligations when they are due. As company operations end, the remaining assets are used to pay creditors and shareholders, based on the priority of their claims.  General partners  are subject to liquidation.
 
 
  The term liquidation may also be used to refer to the selling of poor-performing goods at a price lower than the cost to the business or at a price lower than the business desires.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The term liquidation in finance and economics is the process of bringing a business to an end and distributing its assets to claimants. A bankrupt business is no longer in existence once the liquidation process is complete and it has been deregistered. Liquidation usually occurs during the bankruptcy process under Chapter 7. Proceeds are distributed to claimants in order of priority. Creditors receive priority over shareholders. Liquidation can also refer to the process of selling off inventory, usually at steep discounts. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin 
 
    How Liquidation Works    
  Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governs liquidation proceedings. Solvent companies may also file for  Chapter 7 , but this is uncommon. Not all bankruptcies involve liquidation;  Chapter 11 , for example, involves rehabilitating the bankrupt company and restructuring its debts. In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company will continue to exist after any obsolete inventory is liquidated, after underperforming branches close, and after relevant debts are restructured. 1 2 
 
 
  Unlike when individuals file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, business debts still exist after Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The debt will remain until the statute of limitations has expired, and as there is no longer a debtor to pay what is owed, the debt must be written off by the creditor. 2 
 
 
 
 
    Distribution of Assets During Liquidation    
  Assets are distributed based on the  priority of various parties’  claims, with a trustee appointed by the U.S. Department of Justice overseeing the process. The most senior claims belong to  secured creditors  who have collateral on loans to the business. These lenders will seize the collateral and sell it—often at a significant discount, due to the short time frames involved. If that does not cover the debt, they will recoup the balance from the company’s remaining liquid assets, if any. 3 
 
 
  Next in line are unsecured creditors. These include bondholders, the government (if it is owed taxes), and employees (if they are owed unpaid wages or other obligations). 3 
 
 
  Finally, shareholders receive any remaining assets, in the unlikely event that there are any. In such cases, investors in preferred stock have priority over holders of common stock. Liquidation can also refer to the process of selling off inventory, usually at steep discounts. It is not necessary to file for bankruptcy to liquidate inventory. 3 4  
 
 
    Liquidation of Securities    
  Liquidation can also refer to the act of exiting a securities position. In the simplest terms, this means selling the position for cash; another approach is to take an equal but opposite position in the same security—for example, by  shorting  the same number of shares that make up a long position in a stock.
 
 
  A broker may forcibly liquidate a trader’s positions if the trader’s portfolio has fallen below the  margin requirement , or they have demonstrated a reckless approach to risk-taking.
 
 
    Example of Liquidation    
  Company ABC has been in business for 10 years and has been generating profits throughout its run. In the last year, however, the business has struggled financially due to a downturn in the economy. It has reached a point where ABC can no longer pay any of its debts or cover any of its expenses, such as payments to its suppliers.
 
 
  ABC has decided that it will close up shop and liquidate its business. It enters into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and its assets are sold off. These include a warehouse, trucks, and machinery with a total value of $5 million. Currently, ABC owes $3.5 million to its  creditors  and $1 million to its suppliers. The sale of its assets during the liquidation process will cover its obligations.
 
 
   What Is the Liquidation of a Company? 
 The liquidation of a company happens when company assets are sold when it can no longer meet its financial obligations. Sometimes, the company ceases operations entirely and is deregistered. The assets are sold to pay back various claimants, such as creditors and shareholders. Not all assets will sell at 100% of their value, so the business and bankruptcy courts will determine an  estimated recovery value  of the property to distribute to creditors.

 Definition 
 Liquidity is the term used in finance to refer to how easy it is to convert an asset to cash and not affect its market price. 
    What Is Liquidity?    
  When an asset can be efficiently converted into ready cash without affecting its market value, it is considered a liquid asset. The ability to convert it quickly and efficiently is called liquidity. Consequently, the availability of cash to make such conversions is the biggest influence on whether a market can move efficiently.
 
 
  The more liquid an asset is, the easier and more efficient it is to turn it back into cash. Less liquid assets take more time and may have a higher cost.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset, or security, can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. The two main types of liquidity are market liquidity and accounting liquidity. Current, quick, and cash ratios are most commonly used to measure liquidity. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Tara Anand / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Liquidity    
  Liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value. Tangible assets, such as real estate, fine art, and collectibles, are all relatively illiquid. Other financial assets, ranging from equities to partnership units, fall at various places on the liquidity spectrum. 1 
 
 
  For example, if a person wants a $1,000 refrigerator, cash is the asset that can most easily be used to obtain it. If that person has no cash but a rare book collection that has been appraised at $1,000, they are unlikely to find someone willing to trade the refrigerator for their collection. Instead, they will have to sell the collection and use the cash to purchase the refrigerator.
 
 
  That may be fine if the person can wait for months or years to make the purchase, but it could present a problem if the person has only a few days. They may have to sell the books at a discount, instead of waiting for a buyer who is willing to pay the full value. Rare books are an example of an illiquid asset.

   Fast Fact 
 There are two main measures of liquidity: market liquidity and accounting liquidity. 
 
 
 
    Market Liquidity    
  Market liquidity refers to the extent to which a  market , such as a country’s stock market or a city’s real estate market, allows assets to be bought and sold at stable, transparent prices. In the example above, the market for refrigerators in exchange for rare books is so illiquid that it does not exist. 2 
 
 
  The stock market, on the other hand, is characterized by higher market liquidity. If an exchange has a high volume of trade that is not dominated by selling, the price that a buyer offers per share (the  bid price ) and the price that the seller is willing to accept (the  ask price ) will be fairly close to each other.
 
 
  Investors, then, will not have to give up unrealized gains for a quick sale. When the  spread  between the bid and ask prices tightens,  the market is more liquid ; when it grows, the market instead becomes more illiquid. Markets for real estate are usually far less liquid than stock markets.

 Definition 
 A correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two financial assets or variables. 
    What Is a Correlation?    
  A correlation tells you how two financial variables move together. Financial variables can be assets like stock prices, and bond yields or economic indicators like interest rates. The direction in which they move can be either positive (the same direction) or negative (the opposite direction). Correlations can be used in advanced  portfolio management  and range from +1.0 or the perfect positive correlation to -1.0 or the perfect negative correlation. As an investor, correlations can help you make better investment decisions, minimize your risk, and build a diversified portfolio.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A correlation tells you how two financial variables move in relation to one another. Correlations can be positive or negative. In finance, the correlation can measure the movement of a stock with that of a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. Correlation is closely tied to diversification, the concept that certain types of risk can be mitigated by investing in assets that are not correlated. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Statistical tools like correlation play a big role in finance because they help investors analyze financial data. 
 Investopedia / Sydney Saporito 
 
    What Correlation Can Tell You    
  Correlation shows the strength of a relationship between two variables and is expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient's values range between -1.0 and 1.0.
 
 
  A perfect  positive correlation  means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. A perfect  negative correlation  means that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.
 
 
  For example, large-cap mutual funds generally have a high positive correlation to the  Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index  or nearly one. Small-cap stocks tend to have a positive correlation to the S&P, but it's not as high or approximately 0.8.
 
 
 
 
  However,  put option  prices and their underlying stock prices will tend to have a negative correlation. A put option gives the owner the right but not the obligation to sell a specific amount of an  underlying security  at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. 1 
 
 
  Put option contracts become more profitable when the underlying stock price decreases. In other words, as the stock price increases, the put option prices go down, which is a direct and high-magnitude negative correlation.
 
 
    How to Calculate Correlation    
  There are several methods of calculating correlation. The most common method, the Pearson product-moment correlation, is discussed further in this article. The Pearson product-moment correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables. It can be used for any data set that has a finite covariance matrix. Here are the steps to calculate correlation.
 
 
   Gather data for your ""x-variable"" and ""y variable.  Find the mean for the x-variable and find the mean for the y-variable. Subtract the mean of the x-variable from each value of the x-variable. Repeat this step for the y-variable. Multiply each difference between the x-variable mean and x-variable value by the corresponding difference related to the y-variable. Square each of these differences and add the results.

How Tornadoes Impact the Economy,"Close 
 
 
 
  Consider the damage caused by three-second wind gusts at over 200 mph: over 8,000 buildings flattened, 161 fatalities, and more than 1,000 injured, all costing $2.8 billion; making the tornado that ripped through Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011, not only one of the deadliest on record in the United States but also the costliest. 1 2 
 
 
  With the second-costliest tornado in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, at $2.45 billion, and the third-costliest in Moore, Oklahoma, at $2.0 billion, and with all three tornadoes occurring within just over two years, it is worth thinking about the impact tornadoes can have on the economy. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Tornadoes result in significant economic losses that can be classified as direct losses or indirect losses. Direct losses are the result of the destruction of assets and the resulting decrease in their value and/or the lost income as a result of destroyed assets. Indirect losses relate to the wider impact and include the loss of production and sales, increased commute times, increased transportation costs, and decreased tourist activity. Despite the economic devastation, tornadoes can act as economic stimuli, through rebuilding efforts, the inflow of insurance money and disaster-relief funds, and improvements in the labor market. 
 
    Direct and Indirect Losses    
  The impact of a tornado results in both direct and indirect losses to the local economy. Direct losses result from the destruction of  assets  from the initial impact of the tornado and include the loss of human lives, roads, power, phone lines, crops, factories, homes, and natural resources.
 
 
  Just after the disaster,  USA Today  estimated that the Joplin tornado had caused damage to at least a quarter of the city. To calculate the cost of direct losses, one must either sum up the total value of the decrease in the value of the lost assets or sum up the total of the lost  income  that the lost assets generated. 3 
 
 
  Indirect losses that occur from the destruction of  physical assets  can be quite significant. These losses include lost production and sales, incomes and labor time, increased commute times, increased transportation costs from goods having to be rerouted, decreased tourist activity, and ongoing utility disruptions. The decreased economic activity also results in lost taxable receipts and uses federal disaster relief funds to help clean up, repair, and replace lost assets.
 
 
 
 
  Lost production can also result in surging prices due to consequent  shortages , as when refineries were affected by the swath of tornado activity that swept through the southern United States in 2011, causing regional gas prices to rise. 4 
 
 
  Further, although insurance companies don’t usually increase rates because of a single disaster, increased tornado activity may lead to permanently higher  insurance premiums  or reduced coverage.
 
 
    Tornadoes as Economic Stimuli    
  Although most would agree that  tornadoes  and natural disasters are very undesirable forms of economic stimuli, many economists have found that a flurry of increased economic activity often follows.
 
 
  The rebuilding efforts are fueled by the inflow of insurance and disaster relief funds, which can help replace many of the jobs lost due to the initial disaster. Improvements in the  labor market  are exactly what researchers discovered after studying the economic impact of the Oklahoma City tornado in 1999. 5 
 
 
   Important 
 New jobs and the income generated do not always remain in the local economy as it is often outside contractors that specialize in disaster clean-up and rebuilding. 
 
 
 
  Yet, this type of recovery can have a lot to do with the state of the economy before the disaster. In the case of the Oklahoma City tornado, the economy was strong and, consequently, there was a lot of confidence helping to fuel the rebuilding efforts.
 
 
  In contrast, the struggling town of Picher, Oklahoma, one of America’s Superfund hazardous waste sites, is now a ghost town having ceased municipal operations not long after being hit by an EF-4 tornado in May 2008. 6 
 
 
  Regarding the Joplin tornado, more than $1.8 billion was invested into construction, more than 1,600 homes were built in the five years after the tornado, and new businesses after the tornado generated 2,000 jobs. 7 
 
 
  The amount of jobs created is not necessarily more than those lost from a tornado, and the type of employment is different as well. Although not a tornado, Hurricane Katrina stands as an example: Nearly a year after the initial disaster, employment in Mississippi reached pre-hurricane levels, while the type of work had significantly changed. 8 
 
 
   Are Natural Disasters Good for Growth? 
 Natural disasters can be good for growth, primarily because natural disasters attract new investments. Investments from federal and local governments and donations can help boost the economy of an area hit by a natural disaster. Given the am","By

    What Are Fringe Benefits?    
  Fringe benefits are additions to compensation that employers offer workers to recruit, motivate, and retain high-quality talent. Examples include a company car, paid time off, and a gym membership.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Fringe benefits help employers recruit, motivate, and retain high-quality employees. Employers competing for the most in-demand skills tend to offer the most benefits. Some common benefits, like health and life insurance, are not taxable, but others are taxed at fair market value. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / NoNo Flores 
 
    Understanding Fringe Benefits    
  Common fringe benefits are basic items that are often included in hiring packages. These include  health insurance ,  life insurance , tuition assistance, childcare reimbursement, cafeteria subsidies, below-market loans, employee discounts,  employee stock options , and use of a company-owned vehicle.
 
 
  Uncommon fringe benefits may fit the company profile. PetSmart, for example, has a pet-friendly workplace. Ben & Jerry's rewards its workers with free ice cream. 1  The companies that compete for the best talent in highly competitive fields may offer the most extraordinary fringe benefits. Google's parent company, Alphabet, provides free commuter bus service and a free gourmet cafeteria. 2  Microsoft gives 20 weeks of paid time off to new birth mothers and 12 weeks for other new parents. 3 
 
 
    Tax Considerations    
  Fringe benefits are taxable unless they are specifically exempted. If you receive  taxable fringe benefits , you must include their  fair market value  in your taxable income for the year. The  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  maintains a list called the  Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits . The list of fringe benefits excluded from income taxes includes: 4 
 
 
 
 Accident and health benefits 
 Achievement awards (up to $1,600 for qualified awards) 
 Adoption assistance 
 Athletic facilities 
 Commuting benefits 
 De minimis (minimal) benefits 
 Dependent care assistance 
 Educational assistance 
 Employee discounts 
 Employee stock options 
 Employer-provided cell phones 
 Group-term life insurance coverage 
 Health savings accounts (HSAs) 
 Lodgings on business premises 
 Meals 
 No-additional-cost services 
 Retirement planning services 
 Tuition reduction  
 Working conditions benefits 
 
 
 
 
  All of these exemptions are subject to certain and often complex conditions. For example, achievement awards are only exempt up to a value of $1,600 for qualified plan awards and a value of $400 for non-qualified plan awards. 5 
 
 
  Qualified plan awards are open to all employees, not just highly paid employees. Other exemptions are not available to highly compensated employees if the benefits are given to them but not rank-and-file employees. These include employee discounts, adoption assistance, and dependent care assistance. Most but not all fringe benefits that are income tax-exempt are also exempt from Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes. 4 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The companies that compete for the best talent in highly competitive fields may offer the most extraordinary fringe benefits. 
 
 
 
    Valuing Fringe Benefits    
  Any fringe benefit not named above, or any of the benefits named above that does not conform to IRS rules for exemption, is taxable. The exemption rules are complex, also.

 Definition 
 Unemployment is a key indicator of economic health that occurs when individuals who are actively seeking work are unable to find employment. 
    What Is Unemployment?    
  Unemployment refers to a situation where a person actively  searches for employment  but is unable to find work. Unemployment is considered to be a key measure of the health of the economy. The most frequently used measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate. It's calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the number of people in the labor force. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Unemployment occurs when workers who want to work are unable to find jobs. High rates of unemployment signal economic distress while extremely low rates of unemployment may signal an overheated economy. Unemployment can be classified as frictional, cyclical, structural, or institutional. Unemployment data is collected and published by government agencies in a variety of ways. Many governments offer unemployed individuals a small amount of income through unemployment insurance, as long as they meet certain requirements. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Michela Buttignol / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Unemployment    
  Unemployment is a key  economic indicator  because it signals the ability (or inability) of workers to obtain gainful work and contribute to the productive output of the economy. More unemployed workers mean less total economic production.
 
 
  The unemployment definition doesn't include people who leave the workforce for reasons such as  retirement , higher education, and disability. 1 
 
 
    Sign of Economic Distress    
  Unemployed workers must maintain at least subsistence consumption during their period of unemployment. This means that an economy with high unemployment has lower output without a proportional decline in the need for basic consumption.
 
 
 
 
  High, persistent unemployment can signal serious distress in an  economy  and even lead to social and political upheaval.
 
 
    Sign of an Overheating Economy    
  A low unemployment rate, on the other hand, means that the economy is more likely to be producing near its full capacity, maximizing output, driving wage growth, and raising living standards over time.
 
 
  However,  extremely low unemployment  can also be a cautionary sign of an overheating economy, inflationary pressures, and tight conditions for businesses in need of additional workers.
 
 
    Categories of Unemployment    
  While the definition of unemployment is clear, economists divide unemployment into many different categories. The two broadest categories are voluntary and involuntary unemployment. When unemployment is voluntary, it means that a person left their job willingly in search of other employment. When it is involuntary, it means that a person was fired or laid off and must now look for another job. 2 
 
 
 
 
    Types of Unemployment    
  Voluntary and involuntary unemployment can be broken down into four types. We highlight them below.
 
 
    Frictional Unemployment    
  This type of unemployment is usually short-lived. It is also the least problematic from an economic standpoint. It occurs when people voluntarily change jobs. After a person leaves a company, it naturally takes time to find another job. Similarly, graduates just starting to look for jobs to enter the workforce add to  frictional unemployment .
 
 
  Frictional unemployment is a natural result of the fact that  market  processes take time and information can be costly.

 Definition 
 The stock market consists of a primary market where businesses first issue shares to investors and a secondary market where investors trade shares. 
    What Is the Stock Market?    
  The stock market is a broad term for the network of exchanges, brokerages, and over-the-counter venues where investors buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies. Though people sometimes use ""stock market"" to refer to the  New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE) or the  Nasdaq , these exchanges are components of a wider global marketplace.
 
 
  In the United States, the  Securities and Exchange Commission  regulates companies that want to sell shares to the public. Businesses must register with the SEC and publish periodic disclosures and financial statements. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Companies issue shares on the stock market to raise capital and expand their business. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was created to govern securities transactions on the secondary market. Investors may buy shares to receive dividends, vote in corporate elections, or sell shares at a higher price. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   The stock market plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling money to move between investors and companies. 
 Ellen Lindner / Investopedia 
 
    How the Stock Market Works    
  When people refer to the stock market, they often refer to a specific exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange. But the stock market is a larger system of exchanges, brokerages, and  over-the-counter  markets: Anywhere you can buy part of a company is part of the stock market.
 
 
  In this vast, complex network of trading activities, shares of companies are bought and sold, protected by laws against fraud and other unfair trading practices. The stock market plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling money to move between investors and companies.
 
 
  People purchase stocks for a lot of reasons. Some hold onto shares, looking for income from dividends. Others look for low-priced stocks that are likely to gain value, so that they can sell at a profit. Still, others might be interested in having a say in how particular companies are run. That’s because you can vote at shareholder meetings based on the number of shares you own.

  Owning shares gives you the right to part of the company's profits, often paid as dividends, and sometimes the right to vote on company matters.
 
 
  Sometimes the best way to see how something works is to look at its parts. In that light, let's review the major elements of the stock market, from the companies selling shares to stocks to exchanges to the indexes that give us a snapshot of the stock market's health:
 
 
    What Are Public Companies?    
  Not all companies can offer stock to the public. In the U.S., only companies that are registered with the SEC can sell their shares on a public exchange like the NYSE or Nasdaq. These companies must meet stringent regulations and financial disclosure laws.
 
 
  The traditional route to going public is via an  initial public offering  (IPO). In the 2020s,  special purpose acquisition companies  (SPACs) have emerged as an alternative route for  going public .

 Definition 
 Delivered-at-place (DAP) means that the seller in international trade takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location. 
    What Is Delivered-at-Place (DAP)?    
  The buyer is responsible for paying  import duties  and any applicable taxes, including clearance and local taxes, under the terms of a delivered-at-place (DAP) agreement. Payment comes due when the shipment has arrived at the cited destination. The phrase was introduced in the  International Chamber of Commerce's  (ICC) eighth publication of its Incoterms (international commercial terms) in 2010. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Delivered-at-place is an international trade term that was introduced in the International Chamber of Commerce's eighth publication of its Incoterms. Under DAP, a seller agrees to pay all costs and suffer any potential losses of moving goods sold to a specific location. In simpler terms, the seller takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location under DAP rules. The buyer assumes all the risk and responsibility once the shipment arrives at the destination. Incoterms help clear up any confusion concerning the rights and responsibilities of buyers and sellers of trade contracts. 
 
    How Delivered-at-Place (DAP) Works    
  Buyers and sellers often face complications when it comes to trade contracts, whether they are in the same country or not. As such, there are rules and regulations in place that clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each party in a financial contract. These are known as Incoterms—one of which is a delivered-at-place or DAP agreement.
 
 
  DAP simply means that the seller takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location. This means they are responsible for anything associated with packaging, documentation, export approval, loading charges, and ultimate delivery. The buyer, in turn, takes over the  risk  and responsibility for unloading the goods and clearing them for  import .
 
 
  A delivered-at-place or DAP agreement is applicable for any form or combination of forms of transportation. It usually lists the point at which the buyer takes on financial responsibilities, such as “delivered-at-place, Port of Oakland.”
 
 
 
 
  The term was introduced in 2010. At that time, DAP replaced the term  delivery duty unpaid  (DDU). While DDU may still be used colloquially, DAP is now the official term used in international trade. 1

   Important 
 The opposite of DAP is  delivered duty paid  (DDP), which indicates that the seller must cover duties, import clearance, and any taxes. 
 
 
 
    DAP Obligations    
  The ICC sets out clear obligations for both buyers and sellers for each Incoterm. Below are the key responsibilities of each party.
 
 
    Sellers    
  The seller is the one who bears most of the responsibilities when it comes to shipping under DAP contracts. This includes:
 
 
 
 Documentation:  Under DAP rules, the seller must secure any documentation, including tallies of goods in the shipment, commercial invoicing as well as any packaging and marking related to the  export  of the shipment. 
 Licensing:  The seller must secure any licenses needed to export the goods and take care of any customs issues on their end. 
 Transport:  This category includes any pre-carriage of goods, the delivery to the port, loading onto the container, and main carriage/delivery to the destination. 
 Costs:  The seller must bear the cost of the shipment and must pay for any losses that may result during shipment. 
 Proof of Delivery:  This is provided by the seller to the buyer once the container arrives at the destination. 
 
 
    Buyers    
  While the seller does bear the brunt of the responsibilities under a DAP contract, there are certain things to which the buyer must adhere. These points include:
 
 
   Payment:  The buyer must establish and pay the seller for the goods. They must also advise the seller of the destination. Import:  Once the shipment arrives at the destination, the buyer must take care of any issues related to import. This includes any formalities, such as import forms. Unloading:  The buyer must make arrangements to unload the cargo from the shipping vessel. Costs:  The buyer bears the cost of import duties, taxes, and levies once the shipment arrives at its destination. Transport:  Once unloaded, the buyer is responsible for transporting the goods from the destination/port to their next location. This can be a warehouse, storage facility, or retail location.

 Definition 
 A variable cost is a business expense that’s directly affected by production. 
    What Is a Variable Cost?    
  Business expenses broadly fall into two categories: variable or fixed. Fixed costs remain constant regardless of changes in the level of production. Variable costs fluctuate with the level of production. The cost of raw materials would be variable because it rises or falls when a company increases or decreases production.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A fixed cost remains constant when production is increased or decreased. Variable costs are a key factor in determining a product's contribution margin, the metric used to determine a company's break-even number or its target profit number. Examples of variable costs include raw materials, hourly labor, utilities, commissions, and distribution costs.

    How Variable Costs Work    
  The total expenses incurred by any business consist of variable and fixed costs.
 
 
  Variable costs are dependent on the level of production output or sales. The variable cost of production is a constant amount per unit produced. As the volume of production and output increases, variable costs will also increase.
 
 
  Examples of variable costs are sales  commissions , direct labor costs, cost of raw materials used in production, and utility costs.
 
 
   Important 
 Variable costs are usually viewed as short-term costs as they can be adjusted quickly. For example, if a company is having cash flow issues, it may immediately decide to alter production to reduce costs. 
 
 
 
    Formula and Calculation of Variable Costs    
  The total variable cost is the quantity of output multiplied by the variable cost per unit of output:

   Total Variable Cost  =  Total Quantity of Output x Variable Cost Per Unit of Output 
 
 
  The variable cost per unit will vary across profits. In general, it can often be specifically calculated as the sum of the types of variable costs. Variable costs may need to be allocated across goods if they are incurred in batches (i.e. 100 pounds of raw materials are purchased to manufacture 10,000 finished goods).
 
 
    Types of Variable Costs    
  Along the manufacturing process, there are specific expenses that are usually variable costs. For the examples of these variable costs below, consider the manufacturing and distribution processes for an athletic apparel producer.
 
 
    Raw materials    
   Raw materials  are the goods that a business purchases to create a final product. If the athletic brand buys the shoes rather than manufacturing them, it won't incur the cost of leather, mesh, canvas, or other raw materials.
 
 
  In general, a company should spend roughly the same amount on raw materials for every unit produced assuming no major differences in manufacturing one unit versus another.
 
 
    Direct labor    
  Direct labor costs will vary depending on the units produced. The more units produced, the more direct labor costs.
 
 
  Some labor costs will be incurred even if no units are produced. A salaried accountant or company lawyer will be paid whether the company's output is 100,000 units or 0 units.
 
 
  For others who are paid an hourly rate, more labor hours result in higher paychecks.

 Definition 
 ESG investing involves evaluating a company for a possible investment based on its performance relating to environmental, social, and governance criteria. 
    What Is ESG Investing?    
  ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. ESG investing refers to how companies score on these responsibility metrics and standards for  potential investments . Environmental criteria gauge how a company safeguards the environment. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and communities. Governance measures a company’s leadership, executive pay,  audits ,  internal controls , and shareholder rights.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is used to screen investments based on corporate policies and to encourage companies to act responsibly. Many brokerage firms offer investment products that employ ESG principles. ESG investing can help portfolios avoid holding companies engaged in risky or unethical practices. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    How ESG Investing Works    
  ESG investing is sometimes referred to as  sustainable  investing, responsible investing,  impact investing , or  socially responsible investing  (SRI). To assess a company based on ESG criteria, investors look at a broad range of behaviors and policies. ESG investors seek to ensure the companies they fund are responsible stewards of the environment, good corporate citizens, and led by accountable managers based on criteria including:
 
 
 
 Environmental:  Investors evaluate corporate climate policies, energy use, waste, pollution, natural resource conservation, and treatment of animals. Considerations may include direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, management of toxic waste, and compliance with environmental regulations. 1 
 Social:  A company's relationships with internal and external  stakeholders  are evaluated. 2 Does the company donate a percentage of profits to the local community or encourage employees to volunteer? Do workplace conditions reflect a high regard for employees’ health and safety? 
 Governance:  Ensures a company uses accurate and transparent accounting methods, pursues integrity and diversity in selecting its leadership, and is accountable to shareholders. 3 ESG investors may require assurances that companies avoid  conflicts of interest  in their choice of board members and senior executives, don't use political contributions to obtain preferential treatment or engage in illegal conduct. 
 
 
  ESG investors help inform the investment choices of large institutional investors such as public pension funds. ESG-specific mutual funds and ETFs reached a record $480 billion AUM in 2023. 4 Brokerage and mutual fund companies offer  exchange-traded funds  (ETFs) and other financial products that follow ESG investing strategies.  Robo-advisors  including  Betterment  and  Wealthfront  have promoted these ESG-themed offerings to younger investors.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Socially responsible investing  (SRI) is an investment strategy highlighting one facet of ESG. SRI investors seek companies that promote  ethical and socially conscious themes  including diversity, inclusion, community focus, social justice, corporate ethics, and racial, gender, and sexual discrimination.

 Definition 
 The Zeta Model predicts the likelihood of a public company going bankrupt within two years. 
    What Is the Zeta Model?    
  The Zeta Model is a mathematical model that estimates the chances of a public company going  bankrupt  within a two-year time period. The number produced by the model is referred to as the company's Z-score (or zeta score) and is considered to be a reasonably accurate predictor of future bankruptcy.
 
 
  The model was published in 1968 by New York University professor of finance Edward I. Altman. The  resulting Z-score  uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the financial health of a company.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Zeta Model is a mathematical model that estimates the chances of a public company going bankrupt within a certain time period. The Zeta Model was developed by New York University professor Edward Altman in 1968.  The resulting Z-score uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the financial health of a company. 
 
    The Formula for the Zeta Model Is    
   ζ = 1 . 2 A + 1 . 4 B + 3 . 3 C + 0 . 6 D + E where: ζ = score A = working capital divided by total assets B = retained earnings divided by total assets C = earnings before interest and tax divided by total assets D = market value of equity divided by total liabilities E = sales divided by total assets \begin{aligned} &\zeta = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + E\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\zeta=\text{score}\\ &A = \text{working capital divided by total assets} \\ &B = \text{retained earnings divided by total assets}\\ &C = \text{earnings before interest and tax divided by total assets}\\ &D = \text{market value of equity divided by total liabilities}\\ &E = \text{sales divided by total assets}\\ \end{aligned} ​ ζ = 1 . 2 A + 1 . 4 B + 3 . 3 C + 0 . 6 D + E where: ζ = score A = working capital divided by total assets B = retained earnings divided by total assets C = earnings before interest and tax divided by total assets D = market value of equity divided by total liabilities E = sales divided by total assets ​ ﻿
 
 
    What Does the Zeta Model Tell You?    
  The Zeta Model returns a single number, the  z-score  (or zeta score), to represent the likelihood of a company going bankrupt in the next two years. The lower the z-score, the more likely a company is to go bankrupt. The Zeta model’s bankruptcy prediction accuracy has been found to range from more than 95% percent one period prior to a bankruptcy to 70% for a series of five prior  annual reporting  periods. 1 
 
 
 
 
  Z-scores exist in so-called zones of discrimination, which indicates the likelihood of a firm going bankrupt. A z-score lower than 1.8 indicates that bankruptcy is likely, while scores greater than 3.0 indicate bankruptcy is unlikely to occur in the next two years. Companies that have a z-score between 1.8 and 3.0 are in the gray area, and bankruptcy is as likely as not.
 
 
   Z > 2.99 -“Safe” Zones 1.81 < Z < 2.99 -“Grey” Zones Z < 1.81 -“Distress” Zones 
 
 
  Different z-score formulations and zeta models exist for special cases such as private firms, emerging market risks, and non-manufacturer industrials.
 
 
  The Zeta Model was developed by New York University professor Edward Altman in 1968. The model was originally designed for publicly traded manufacturing companies. Later versions of the model were developed for privately held companies, small businesses and non-manufacturing companies and emerging markets.

What Is a Marketing Strategy?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan covering the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion, and whose goal is to reach potential customers. 
    What Is a Marketing Strategy?    
  A marketing strategy can sway consumers to buy a particular company's products or services. It may include multiple marketing ideas for each of the firm's sectors or product lines. A marketing strategy contains the company’s  value proposition , key brand messaging, and data on target customer demographics.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A marketing strategy may include current or future marketing initiatives and detail a company's goals and timetables. The success of a marketing strategy can be quantified through metrics like the number of new customers, revenue, and sales. A marketing strategy may include advertising, outreach, and public relations campaigns. 
 
    Understanding Marketing Strategies    
  A clear marketing strategy should revolve around the company’s value proposition. This communicates to consumers what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves the customers' business. A well-constructed value proposition provides marketing teams with a template that should inform their initiatives across all of the company’s products and services.
 
 
  The ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable  competitive advantage  over rival companies. To do this, a business must understand the needs and wants of its customers. Whether it’s a print ad design,  mass customization , or a social media campaign, a marketing asset should effectively communicate a company’s core value proposition.
 
 
  For example, Walmart ( WMT ) is widely known as a discount retailer with “everyday low prices.” Low prices are its value proposition, so all its business operations and marketing efforts are rooted in that idea, which appeals to its core consumer base. 1  Its marketing strategies may be found on TV, in print, or on the accounts of social media influencers, but they all emphasize the same value proposition of low prices on everyday products.
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Many companies use  market research  to identify what is most important to consumers and how to differentiate their products or services from those of competitors. This information can be used to identify untapped audiences and develop a plan for reaching them, which will increase sales and improve a company's bottom line. 
 
 
 
    Marketing Strategies vs. Marketing Plans    
  The marketing strategy is outlined in the  marketing plan . This is a document that details the specific types of marketing activities a company will conduct in a given timeframe. It contains important information such as what the current and near-future marketing initiatives will be, how they will be conducted, what their goals are, and the timetables for enacting them. A company may have separate marketing initiatives for each of its products or services; it may also have multiple marketing initiatives for the same product or service that are implemented at different times or on different platforms.

  Marketing strategies inform a business's marketing across many verticals and over a longer period. These strategies should ideally have longer life spans than individual marketing plans because they contain value propositions and other key elements of a company’s brand, which generally hold constant over the long haul.
 
 
   Important 
 Marketing strategies cover big-picture messaging, while marketing plans delineate the logistical details of specific campaigns. 
 
 
 
  For example, a marketing strategy might say that a company aims to increase authority in niche circles where their clients visit. The marketing plan puts that into action by commissioning thought leadership pieces on LinkedIn. 
 
 
    How to Create a Marketing Strategy    
  Creating a thoughtful and effective marketing strategy requires several steps.
 
 
    Identify Goals    
  While sales are the ultimate goal for every company, a marketing strategy can also include short-term goals such as:
 
 
   Establishing authority Increasing customer engagement Generating leads 
 
 
  These smaller goals offer measurable benchmarks for the progress of your marketing plan. Think of strategy as the high-level ideology and planning as how you accomplish your goals.
 
 
    Create a Customer Profile    
  Every product or service has an ideal customer, and you should have a profile outlining what you know about yours. It can include:

 Definition 
 A fiscal quarter consists of financial reports submitted and dividends paid by companies every three months of a financial year. It’s like a report card for companies that comes out four times over a fiscal year. 
    What Is a Fiscal Quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)?    
  A fiscal quarter is a three-month period in a company’s financial year used to report  earnings  and pay  dividends . It’s often labeled as Q1 for the first quarter, Q2 for the second, and so on.

   Key Takeaways 
 A fiscal quarter is a three-month time span in a business’s financial year that it uses to report earnings and pay dividends. A quarter refers to one-fourth of a year and is typically expressed as Q1 for the first quarter, Q2 for second quarter, etc., and can be expressed with the year, such as Q1 2022 (or Q1’22). Quarterly reports (known as 10-Q filings with the SEC) and earnings are crucial pieces of information for investors and analysts. The IRS also imposes quarterly reporting requirements, including quarterly estimated tax payments for certain taxpayers. Though beneficial for organizing financial information and comparing it across prior quarterly periods, critics of quarters point to the extra reporting cost and burden. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Julie Bang / Investopedia 
 
    Quarters in a Fiscal Year    
  Most financial reporting and dividend payments are done quarterly. Not all companies will have fiscal quarters that correspond to calendar quarters, and it is common for a company to close its fourth quarter after its busiest time of year. Dividends are also often paid quarterly, although many companies outside the United States may not pay dividends evenly.
 
 
  Companies have two main  accounting periods : the fiscal quarter and the  fiscal year (FY) . The fiscal year for most companies runs from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 (although it doesn’t have to). The standard calendar quarters that make up the year are as follows:
 
 
   January, February, and March (Q1) April, May, and June (Q2) July, August, and September (Q3) October, November, and December (Q4) 
 
 
 
 
  Some companies have fiscal years that follow different dates. For example, the fiscal year for Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST ) begins in September and ends the following August. Thus, its fiscal fourth quarter includes June, July, and August. 1

 Definition 
 Standard deviation establishes the average spread of individual values from the mean for a group. 
    What Is Standard Deviation?    
  Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that looks at how far discrete points in a dataset are dispersed from the  mean  of that set. It is calculated as the square root of the  variance .
 
 
  If data points are far from the mean, there is a higher deviation within the data set.
 
 
   Key Takeaways: 
 Standard deviation is used to measure the dispersion of dataset values relative to the mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance. Standard deviation, in finance, is often used as a measure of the relative riskiness of an asset. A volatile stock has a high standard deviation, while a stable blue-chip stock's is usually rather low. Standard deviation is also used by businesses to assess risk, manage business operations, and plan cash flows based on seasonal changes and volatility.

    Understanding Standard Deviation    
  Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that is often used in finance, particularly in investing.
 
 
    For Price Volatility    
  When applied to the annual rate of return of an investment, it can provide information on that investment's  historical volatility . This means that it shows how much the price of that investment has fluctuated over time.
 
 
  The greater the standard deviation of securities, the greater the variance between each price and the mean, which shows a larger price range.

  For example, a volatile stock has a high standard deviation, meaning that its price goes up and down frequently. The standard deviation of a stable  blue-chip  stock, on the other hand, is usually rather low, meaning that its price is usually stable.
 
 
    For Price Trends    
  Standard deviation can also be used to predict performance trends. In investing, for example, an index fund is designed to replicate a  benchmark  index. This means that the fund should have a low standard deviation from the value of the benchmark.
 
 
  On the other hand, aggressive  growth funds  often have a high standard deviation from relative stock indices. This is because their portfolio managers make aggressive bets to generate higher-than-average returns.
 
 
  This higher standard deviation correlates with the level of risk investors can expect from that index. 
 
 
  Standard deviation is one of the key fundamental risk measures that analysts, portfolio managers, and advisors use. Investment firms report the standard deviation of their  mutual funds  and other products.
 
 
  A large dispersion shows how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns. Because it is easy to understand, this statistic is regularly reported to the end clients and investors.
 
 
   Warning 
 Standard deviation calculates all uncertainty as risk, even when it’s in the investor's favor—such as above-average returns. 
 
 
 
    Standard Deviation Formula    
  Standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of a value derived from comparing data points to a collective mean of a population. The formula is:

 Definition 
 The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis releases Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures quarterly and annually. 
    What Is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?    
  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) includes consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investments. It functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a country’s economic health. GDP may be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights.  Real GDP  accounts for inflation, while  Nominal GDP  does not.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 GDP helps measure the size of a country's economy and its growth rate. The GDP growth rate compares the annual or quarterly change in a country’s economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. GDP increases when a country's exports exceed its imports. Inflation may rise as GDP grows due to strengthening demand or a reduction in supply.

    Understanding Gross Domestic Product (GDP)    
  The calculation of a country’s GDP encompasses all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign  balance of trade . Exports are added to the value, and imports are subtracted. 1 
 
 
  Of all the components that make up a country’s GDP, the foreign balance of trade is especially important. The GDP of a country tends to increase when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers sell to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy. When this situation occurs, a country is said to have a  trade surplus .
 
 
  If the opposite situation occurs—that is, if the amount that domestic consumers spend on foreign products is greater than the total sum of what domestic producers can sell to foreign consumers—it is called a  trade deficit . In this situation, the GDP of a country tends to decrease.
 
 
 
 
  GDP can be computed on a nominal basis or a real basis, the latter accounting for  inflation . Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing long-term national economic performance since it uses  constant dollars . 2

  Let’s say one country had a nominal GDP of $100 billion in 2014. By 2024, its nominal GDP grew to $150 billion. Prices also rose by 100% over the same period. In this example, if you look solely at its nominal GDP, the country’s economy appears to be performing well.
 
 
  However, the real GDP (expressed in 2014 dollars) would only be $75 billion, revealing that an overall decline in real economic performance actually occurred during this time.
 
 
    What Does GDP Tell You?    
  A country’s GDP represents the final market value of all the products and services that a country produces in a single year. Another way to measure GDP is as the sum of four factors: consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investment.
 
 
  In the United States, GDP is calculated every three months by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) . The BEA makes its estimate based on price estimates, survey data, and other information collected by other agencies, such as the Census Bureau, Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. 3

"Sluggish Economy: What it is, Characterizations, FAQs","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Sluggish Economy?    
  A sluggish economy is an economy in which growth is slow to negligible in macroeconomic terms. The term is an analogy to familiar species of nonshell-bearing terrestrial gastropods which move very slowly. The word ""sluggish"" can refer to the economy as a whole or one of its components, such as sluggish  housing starts .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 A sluggish economy is an economy that is experiencing little or no macroeconomic growth. 
 The term is a zoological analogy to the common slug and is not a precisely defined term. 
 Sluggish economies may be characterized by falling GDP growth or high unemployment. 
 Sluggish economies are generally considered bad for most businesses, yet there are opportunities for certain businesses and industries. 
 Central banks may attempt to stimulate a sluggish economy through  quantitative easing . 
 
 
    Understanding a Sluggish Economy    
  The term sluggish economy is a colloquial phrase frequently used in financial and business media, with no exact, quantitative definition. It is a zoological comparison to the animals known as slugs, which move very slowly, in some cases traveling at an average speed of only 0.000023 meters per second. 1 
 
 
  Like a slug, a sluggish economy is moving ahead, but very slowly. Though a sluggish economy may be used to mean  slow or zero economic growth , it is not generally used to refer to negative growth or outright contraction in an economy, since slugs are physically incapable of moving backward. 2  Note, however, that a sluggish economy is just an analogy and does not necessarily involve actual slugs.
 
 
  One may, for example, see a headline like, ""Economy Sluggish Due to Rising Oil Prices."" Although the world economies are linked to global commodities and finance in different ways, there have been many cases of a sluggish global economy affecting all countries and most sectors.
 
 
    Characteristics of a Sluggish Economy    
  In a sluggish global economy, many countries can still experience positive growth, but the overall pace is still slow. Both during and after the  Great Recession , a sluggish American economy had a negative effect on the global economy. This is because the U.S. was the world's largest economy and a vital source of trade and investment for much of the rest of the world.
 
 
 
 
  Short periods of sluggish economic growth may occur at the peak of a business cycle when the economy is transitioning from a period of more rapid growth into a  recession . A sluggish economy is often considered a  leading indicator  of a potentially steeper downturn.
 
 
  Extended periods of sluggishness can occur after a recession if the subsequent economic recovery is held up by poor economic policy or for some other reason. A sluggish economy may also occur as a persistent condition resulting from underlying structural issues that constrain economic growth, such as an aging population, the dominance of mature, low-growth industries, or government policies that discourage growth.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Debt collection, mediation, and job search services are examples of businesses that are likely to see demand increase when an economy is in the doldrums. 
 
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  A sluggish economy is harmful to most businesses since consumers are less likely to purchase their products. It may also have a negative effect on the labor market as businesses are less willing to hire more staff in times of weak  economic growth .
 
 
  However, a sluggish economy can actually be beneficial for certain businesses and sectors. Businesses that see demand go up in weak economic conditions include debt collection, mediation, and job search services.
 
 
   Recession-resistant  sectors like healthcare also benefit as a sluggish economy keeps costs low, with more businesses and individuals competing aggressively for the spending dollars of organizations that are still flush with cash. With overall belt-tightening, there is also a consumer preference for lower-cost substitutes, which plays into the hands of discount retailers.
 
 
  During a sluggish economy, investors want to focus on companies that either provide essentials or the best value for a consumer's dollar—and ideally a company that provides both. Depending on how long an economy remains sluggish, there can be several shakeouts at the higher end of the  conspicuous consumption  scale.
 
 
  This downward pressure can offer an opportunity to short some higher-end brands, but a sluggish economy alone should not be the sole trade trigger. Many high-end brands have a global strategy that helps offset periods of sluggishness in any one market.
 
 
   How Does the Federal Reserve Stimulate a Sluggish Economy? 
 During periods of sluggish economic growth, the federal reserve may try to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates. This increases the circulation of money in the economy, thereby stimulating more economic act","By

"Yankee Bond: What it is, How it Works, Pros and Cons","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Yankee Bond?    
  A Yankee bond is a debt obligation issued by a foreign entity, such as a government or company, which is traded in the United States and denominated in U.S. dollars.
 
 
   key takeaways 
 A Yankee bond is a debt obligation denominated in U.S. dollars that is publicly issued in the U.S. by foreign banks and corporation, and sometimes even governments. Yankee bonds are subject to U.S. securities laws, as they trade on U.S. exchanges. Yankee bonds offer the issuer to chance to get cheaper financing and reach a broader investment audience; they offer investors the chance for better yields. On the downside, Yankee bonds can take a long time to come to market, subjecting them to interest rate risk; they are also vulnerable to currency risk and other problems in their home country's economy. 
 
    Understanding a Yankee Bond    
  Yankee bonds are governed by the  Securities Act of 1933 , which requires the bonds to be registered with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  before being offered for sale. Yankee bonds are frequently issued in tranches, individual portions of a larger debt offering or structured financing arrangement that have differing risk levels, interest rates and maturities, and offerings may be extremely large, as much as $1 billion.
 
 
  There are also  Yankee certificate of deposits , CDs that are issued in the United States by a branch or agency of a foreign bank.
 
 
    Advantages of Yankee Bonds    
  Yankee bonds can represent a win-win opportunity for both issuers and investors. One of the primary potential advantages for a Yankee bond issuer is the opportunity to obtain cheaper financing capital at a lower cost if comparable bond rates in the United States are significantly lower than the current rates in a foreign company’s own country. The size of the U.S.  bond market  and the fact U.S. investors very actively trade it also confers an advantage for the issuer, especially if the bond offering is a large one. Although U.S. regulatory requirements may initially hamper a foreign issuer in regard to obtaining approval to offer bonds, conditions for lending in the United States may still be less stringent overall than those in the issuer’s own country, allowing the issuer greater flexibility in terms of the offering.
 
 
 
 
  A major advantage for U.S. investors in Yankee bonds is such bonds frequently offer higher yields than the yields available on comparable, or even lower-rated, bond issues from U.S. issuers. Another potential advantage is the fact that Yankee bonds offer investors a means of obtaining international diversification in a portfolio of bond investments. Yankee bonds also offer U.S. investors an advantage over investing in foreign corporation bond issues made in the foreign company’s home country. Since Yankee bonds are  denominated in U.S. dollars , the currency risk commonly associated with foreign bond investments is virtually eliminated.
 
 
    Disadvantages of Yankee Bonds    
  One of the drawbacks of Yankee bonds for issuers is the time involved. Because of strict U.S. regulations for the issuing of such bonds, it can take more than three months for a Yankee bond issue to be approved for sale. The approval process includes an evaluation of the issuer’s  creditworthiness  by a debt-rating agency such as Moody’s or  Standard & Poor’s .
 
 
  Another consideration is the interest rate environment. Foreign issuers usually favor issuing Yankee bonds when there is a low-interest-rate environment in the United States, since that means the issuer can offer the bond with lower interest payments. But should something send interest rates soaring or plummeting in three months, it could mess up the carefully calibrated pricing of the Yankee bond, affecting how well it sells.
 
 
  Finally, a Yankee bond can be affected by the economy of its home country. So if that country has a shaky economy, its price could topple, or the issuer could run into problems—which could affect its coupon payments. And while the Yankee bond is issued in dollars, it could be vulnerable to some currency risk as well, as a nation's economic woes often affect its money's performance in the foreign exchange markets.

 A budget is an estimation of revenue, expenses, or changes in finances over a specified future period and is usually compiled and re-evaluated on a periodic basis. 
    What Is a Budget?    
  A budget is estimation that's made for a specified future period of time. Budgeting usually occurs on an ongoing basis, with individual budgets being re-evaluated regularly. Budgets can be made for any entity that needs or wants to spend money, including governments and businesses, people, and households of any income level.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A budget is a financial plan utilized by governments, businesses, and individuals of any income level. A budget is usually for a defined period that can greatly enhance the success of any financial undertaking. Corporate budgets are essential for operating at peak efficiency.

   A budget can help you set and track your financial goals. 
 Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Understanding Budgeting    
  A budget is a microeconomic concept that reveals the trade-off made when one good is exchanged for another. In terms of the bottom line—or the end result of this trade-off—a  surplus budget  means profits are anticipated, a  balanced budget  means revenues are expected to equal expenses, and a  deficit budget  means expenses will exceed revenues. These principles hold true whether the budget is intended for an individual, a family, or a company.
 
 
  First, let's take a quick look at the budgeting process for a corporation, and then personal budgeting. 
 
 
    Corporate Budgets    
  Budgets are an integral part of running any business efficiently and effectively. Corporate budgeting begins by establishing assumptions for the upcoming budget period. These assumptions are related to projected sales trends, cost trends, and the overall economic outlook of the market,  industry,  or  sector . Specific factors affecting potential expenses are addressed and monitored.
 
 
 
 
  The budget is published in a packet that outlines the standards and procedures used to develop it, including the assumptions about the markets, key relationships with vendors that provide discounts, and explanations of how certain calculations were made.

What Is Wearable Technology (Wearables)? Definition and Examples,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Wearable Technology?    
  Wearable technology, also known as ""wearables,"" is a category of electronic devices that can be worn as accessories, embedded in clothing, implanted in the user's body, or even tattooed on the skin. The devices are hands-free gadgets with practical uses, powered by microprocessors and enhanced with the ability to send and receive data via the Internet.
 
 
  The rapid adoption of such devices has placed wearable technology at the forefront of the  Internet of things (IoT) .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Wearable technology is evolving into an important category of the Internet of things, with life-changing applications in medicine and other fields. Also known as wearables, the growth of mobile networks, high-speed data transfer, and miniaturized microprocessors have enabled the development of this technology. These technologies may be worn, embedded in fabric or accessories, or tattooed directly onto the skin. 
 
    How Wearable Technology Works    
  Wearable technology can be said to have existed since eyeglasses were first developed in the 13th century. Timepieces small enough to be worn have been around since about 1500. But modern wearable technology is defined as incorporating a microprocessor and an internet connection.
 
 
  The growth of mobile networks enabled the development of wearable technology. Fitness activity trackers were the first big wave of wearable technology to catch on with consumers. Then, the wristwatch became a screen and more robust mobile applications were added. Bluetooth headsets, smartwatches, and web-enabled glasses all allow people to receive data from Wi-Fi networks. The gaming industry adds more wearables, with virtual reality and augmented reality headsets.
 
 
    Specialized and Practical Applications    
  There have been some flops, too, notably  Google Glass . The Internet-connected eyeglasses may yet re-emerge for specialized uses but they most definitely did not make it as a fashion accessory.
 
 
  The focus in the development of wearable technology now appears to be moving from consumer accessories to more specialized and practical applications. Microchip implants are now being used to replace keys and passwords. Embedded in a fingertip, the chips use near-field communication (NFC) or radio-frequency identification (RFID) and are similar to the chips used to track lost pets.
 
 
 
 
  The real life-altering applications in wearable technology, however, can be found in medical devices.

 Cyrcadia Health has developed Cyrcadia Breast Monitor, an intelligent patch that can detect early signs of breast cancer and transmit the information to a lab for analysis. 1 
 
 
 
    Examples of Wearable Technology    
  The past few years have seen rapid development and introduction of wearable technology products adapted for medical and healthcare uses. These include:
 
 
 
 In Louisville, Kentucky, wearable devices made by  AIR Louisville  are being used to monitor local air quality, measure pollutants, and identify hotspots for residents with respiratory problems. 2 
 Cyrcadia Health has developed Cyrcadia Breast Monitor, an intelligent patch that can detect early signs of breast cancer and transmit the information to a lab for analysis. 1 
 Wearable medical alert monitors are extending greater mobility and independence to the elderly and impaired. 3 
 Smart tattoos that contain flexible electronic sensors are being developed to monitor heart and brain activity, sleep disorders, and muscle function. While these are temporary, even  inks  are being explored! 
 A smartwatch for people with Parkinson's disease tracks symptoms and transmits the data so that more personalized treatment plans can be developed.

 Definition 
 A null hypothesis is a statistical assumption suggesting that any observed patterns or differences in a dataset are due to chance and not the result of a meaningful effect. 
    What Is a Null Hypothesis?    
  A null hypothesis is a foundational concept in statistics that assumes there is no real relationship or effect in the data being analyzed, and that any variations or trends are simply the result of random fluctuation rather than a true underlying cause.
 
 
   Hypothesis testing  is used to assess the credibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Sometimes referred to simply as the “null,” it is represented as H 0 .
 
 
  The null hypothesis, also known as “the conjecture,” is used in  quantitative analysis  to test theories about markets, investing strategies, and economies to decide if an idea is true or false.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A null hypothesis is a type of conjecture in statistics that proposes that there is no difference between certain characteristics of a population or data-generating process. The alternative hypothesis proposes that there is a difference. Hypothesis testing provides a method to reject a null hypothesis within a certain confidence level. If you can reject the null hypothesis, it provides support for the alternative hypothesis. Null hypothesis testing is the basis of the principle of falsification in science. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Researchers use the null hypothesis as a baseline for testing, even if they don't believe is true. 
 Alex Dos Diaz / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding a Null Hypothesis    
  A gambler may be interested in whether a game of chance is fair. If it is, then the expected earnings per play come to zero for both players. If it is not, then the expected earnings are positive for one player and negative for the other.
 
 
 
 
  To test whether the game is fair, the gambler collects earnings data from many repetitions of the game, calculates the average earnings from these data, and then tests the null hypothesis that the expected earnings are not different from zero.

  If the average earnings from the sample data are sufficiently far from zero, then the gambler will reject the null hypothesis and conclude the alternative hypothesis—namely, that the expected earnings per play are different from zero. If the average earnings from the  sample data  are near zero, then the gambler will not reject the null hypothesis, concluding instead that the difference between the average from the data and zero is explainable by chance alone.
 
 
   Important 
 A null hypothesis can only be rejected, not proven. 
 
 
 
  The null hypothesis assumes that any kind of difference between the chosen characteristics that you see in a set of data is due to chance. For example, if the expected earnings for the gambling game are truly equal to zero, then any difference between the average earnings in the data and zero is due to chance.
 
 
  Analysts look to reject   the null hypothesis because doing so is a strong conclusion. This requires evidence in the form of an observed difference that is too large to be explained solely by chance. Failing to reject the null hypothesis—that the results are explainable by chance alone—is a weak   conclusion because it allows that while factors other than chance may be at work, they may not","0 seconds of 1 minute, 33 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/null_hypothesis.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

 An irrevocable trust can't be changed or cancelled unless its beneficiary or a court allows it. 
    What Is an Irrevocable Trust?    
  The purpose of an irrevocable trust is to move  assets  from the  grantor's  control and name to that of the  beneficiary . This protects the assets from  creditors  and reduces the value of the grantor's estate, which lowers  estate taxes .
 
 
  Irrevocable trusts can't be modified, amended, or terminated without the permission of the grantor's beneficiary or by the order of a court. The exact rules can vary by state. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An irrevocable trust offers tax-shelter benefits that revocable trusts do not. An irrevocable trust can't be altered or canceled without permission from the grantor's beneficiaries or by court order. The grantor relinquishes their ownership of their assets to the trust.

    How an Irrevocable Trust Works    
  Irrevocable trusts are generally set up to minimize estate taxes, access government benefits, and protect assets. This is in contrast to a  revocable trust . With a revocable trust, the grantor can modify or cancel the trust. However, there is no creditor protection.
 
 
  With an irrevocable trust, the grantor transfers ownership of the assets to the trust, legally removing all  incidents of ownership . This removes the trust's assets from the grantor's  taxable estate . It also relieves the grantor of the tax liability on the income generated by the assets. 1  While the tax rules vary between jurisdictions, the grantor can't receive these benefits if they are the  trustee  (the person with a  fiduciary duty  to hold the assets in trust for the beneficiary).
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The assets held in the trust can include (but are not limited to) a business, investment assets, cash, and life insurance policies. 
 
 
 
  Irrevocable trusts are especially useful for individuals who work in professions that may make them vulnerable to lawsuits, such as doctors or attorneys. Once an asset is transferred to such a trust, it is owned by the trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries. Therefore, it is safe from legal judgments and  creditors  since the trust will not be a party to any lawsuit.

  Today’s irrevocable trusts come with many provisions that were not commonly found in older versions of these instruments. These additions allow for much greater flexibility in trust management and distribution of assets. Provisions such as decanting, which allows a trust to be moved into a newer trust with more modern or advantageous provisions, can ensure that the trust assets will be managed effectively. 2  Other features that allow the trust to change its state of domicile can provide additional tax savings or other benefits.
 
 
    Types of Irrevocable Trusts    
  Irrevocable trusts come in two forms: living trusts and testamentary trusts.
 
 
  A  living trust , which is also known as an  inter vivos  (Latin for ""between the living"") trust, is originated and funded by an individual during their lifetime. Examples of living trusts include the following.

High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI): Criteria and Example,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A high-net-worth individual (HNWI) is generally defined as someone with more than $1 million in highly liquid assets. 
    What Is a High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI)?    
  A high-net-worth individual (HNWI) is someone with liquid assets of at least $1 million after accounting for their liabilities. Liquid assets held by HNWIs include cash and investments that can be easily liquidated or converted to cash, including stocks. HNWIs need and receive tailored financial and money management services due to their net worth. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A high-net-worth individual typically has at least $1 million in liquid financial assets. North America had a record number of HNWIs, at 8.4 million people as of December 2024. HNWIs can be subclassified based on their net worth, such as an ultra-high-net-worth individual with over $30 million in liquid assets. 
 
    Understanding High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)    
  High-net-worth individuals are people whose  net worth  meets a minimum threshold. While the amount often differs by financial institution and region, the generally accepted minimum is $1 million in liquid assets. This figure excludes the person’s primary residence and assets, such as fine art and antiques, which can be difficult to sell. 1 
 
 
  There are several ways to reach a high net worth. Working, saving, and making smart investments can lead to an increase in net worth. Other ways include inheriting a large sum, winning the lottery, selling a valuable asset or business, and receiving a settlement or life insurance payout.
 
 
  HNWIs usually get more benefits than those whose net worth falls under $1 million. Most banks require customers to have a certain amount of liquid assets, a certain amount in depository accounts with the bank (or both) to qualify as an HNWI. If they do, they may get services with reduced fees, special rates, and access to investor events that are closed to most. 2 3 
 
 
  The more money a person has, the more work it takes to maintain and preserve those assets. These individuals may demand and can justify personalized investment management, estate planning, and tax planning services. They generally qualify for separately managed investment accounts rather than mutual funds.

 Their wealth allows high-net-worth individuals to participate in initial public offerings (IPOs) and invest in startups that demonstrate financial potential. 
 
 
 
    Types of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)    
  HNWIs can be divided into several different categories. Where they fall depends on how much they're worth:
 
 
 
 Sub-HNWI:  An individual with more than $100,000 but less than $1 million 
 Very-HNWI:  An individual whose net worth is between $1 million and $5 million 
 Ultra-high-net-worth individual (UHNWI) :  This is someone who has a net worth of at least $30 million. 
 
 
  Remember that a person's liquid assets are considered when calculating their net worth. As such, it excludes property like their primary residence, collectibles, and consumer durables.
 
 
    Where Are Most High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)?    
  North America had the highest concentration of HNWIs at the end of 2024, with about 8.4 million, according to Capgemini. The Asia-Pacific region followed with 7.6 million individuals. HNWIs in Europe totaled 5.7 million, while those in Latin America numbered 600,000. The Middle East had 900,000 HNWIs, and Africa had 200,000. 
 
 
  The total number of HNWIs worldwide increased by 2.6% from 2023 to the end of 2024, with North America experiencing the largest increase of 7.3%. The HNWI population had a total of $90.5 trillion in wealth. 4 
 
 
  The management consulting firm Capgemini separates the HNWI population into three wealth bands: 5 
 
 
   Millionaires next door, who have $1 million to $5 million in investable wealth Mid-tier millionaires, with $5 million to $30 million to invest Ultra-HNWIs, who have more than $30 million 
 
 
  Globally, the ultra-HNWI population numbered 234,000 in 2024. That’s an increase of 6.3% from 2023. Mid-tier millionaires numbered 2.16 million, while the millionaires next door category made up the largest group, at 21.02 million. 6 
 
 
    Benefits Afforded to High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)    
  The benefits for high-net-worth individuals vary by financial institution and region. As an HNWI, you may qualify for banking, investment, and other financial services with reduced fees, discounts, and special rates, along with access to special events and perks.

    What Is Laissez-Faire?    
  Laissez-faire is an economic theory dating back to the 18th century that opposes any government intervention in business affairs. The driving principle behind laissez-faire economics is that the less the  government  is involved in the  economy , the better off business, and society as a whole, will be.
 
 
  It is a French term that translates to “leave alone,” or more literally to “let you do.”
 
 
  Laissez-faire economics is a key component of  free-market  capitalism.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Laissez-faire is an economic philosophy of free-market capitalism that opposes government intervention. The theory of laissez-faire was developed by the French Physiocrats during the 18th century. Laissez-faire advocates that economic success is inhibited when governments are involved in business and markets. Later free-market economists built on the ideas of laissez-faire as a path to economic prosperity, though detractors have criticized it for promoting inequality. Critics argue that markets do need a certain degree of government regulation and involvement. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Sydney Saporito / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Laissez-Faire    
  The underlying beliefs that make up the fundamentals of laissez-faire economics include the idea that economic competition constitutes a “natural order” that rules the world. Because this natural self-regulation is the best type of regulation, laissez-faire  economists  argue that there is no need for business and industrial affairs to be complicated by  government intervention .
 
 
  As a result, they oppose any sort of federal involvement in the economy, which includes any type of legislation or oversight; they are against  minimum wages , duties, trade restrictions, and  corporate taxes . In fact, laissez-faire economists see such taxes as a penalty for production.

   Important 
 Laissez-faire is often associated with libertarian views on the economy, where government plays an extremely limited role. In fact, one of the key characteristics of laissez-faire economics is that the government should only be involved with the following three functions: 
 
 Protecting the national borders via a standing army 
 Protecting private property rights and personal freedom via a police force and judiciary 
 Producing  public goods  that serve society, such as parks and libraries, that the market would not be incentivized to produce on its own 
 
 
 
 
    History of Laissez-Faire    
  Popularized in the mid-1700s, the doctrine of laissez-faire is one of the first articulated economic theories. It originated with a group known as the Physiocrats, who flourished in France from about 1756 to 1778. 1  These thinkers tried to apply scientific principles and methodology to the study of wealth and economic production.
 
 
 
 
  These economists argued that a free market and free economic  competition  were extremely important to the health of a free society. 2  They believed the government should only intervene in the economy to preserve property, life, and individual freedom; otherwise, the natural, unchanging laws that govern market forces and economic processes—what later British economist  Adam Smith  dubbed the “ invisible hand ”—should be allowed to proceed un","0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

 A value chain is the full range of activities needed to create a product or service and make it available to consumers. 
    What Is a Value Chain?    
  A value chain is a series of consecutive steps that go into the creation of a finished product, from its initial design to its arrival at a customer’s door. The chain identifies each step in the process at which value is added, including the sourcing, manufacturing, and marketing stages of its production.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A value chain is a step-by-step business model for transforming a product or service from idea to reality. Value chains help increase a business’s efficiency so the business can deliver the most value for the least possible cost. The end goal of a value chain is to create a competitive advantage for a company by increasing productivity while keeping costs reasonable. Value chain theory analyzes a firm’s five primary activities and four support activities. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Dennis Madamba / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Value Chains    
  Because of ever-increasing competition for lower prices, better products, and customer loyalty, companies must continually examine the value they create to retain their  competitive advantage . A  value chain  can help a company to discern areas of its business that are inefficient and implement strategies that will  optimize its procedures  for maximum efficiency and profitability.
 
 
  In addition to ensuring that production mechanics are seamless and efficient, businesses also need to keep customers confident and secure enough to remain loyal.  Value chain analyses can help  with this, too.
 
 
  Michael E. Porter, of Harvard Business School, introduced the concept of a value chain in his book, “Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.” He wrote: “Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering, and supporting its product.” 1 
 
 
 
 
  In other words, it’s important to maximize value at each specific point in a firm’s processes.
 
 
   Important 
 The overarching goal of a value chain is to deliver the most value for the least cost in order to create a competitive advantage. 
 
 
 
    Components of a Value Chain    
  In his concept of a value chain, Porter splits a business’s activities into two categories, primary and support, of which sample activities for each are listed below. Specific activities in each category will vary according to the industry. 1 
 
 
    Primary Activities    
  Primary activities consist of five components, all essential for adding value and creating competitive advantage:
 
 
   Inbound logistics  include functions like receiving, warehousing, and managing inventory. Operations  include procedures for converting raw materials into a finished product. Outbound logistics  include activities to distribute a final product to a consumer. Marketing and sales  include strategies to enhance visibility and target appropriate customers—such as advertising, promotion, and pricing. Service  includes programs to maintain products and enhance the consumer experience, like customer service, maintenance, repairs, refunds, and exchange. 
 
 
    Support Activities    
  The role of support activities is to help make the primary activities more efficient. When you increase the efficiency of any of the four support activities, it benefits at least one of the five primary activities. These support activities are generally denoted as overhead","0 seconds of 1 minute, 24 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuechain.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

 Definition 
 Due diligence is the process of carefully examining and verifying information before making a decision or moving forward with a particular action or agreement. 
    What Is Due Diligence?    
  Due diligence refers to the thorough research and evaluation carried out to confirm the accuracy of information and assess any potential risks before committing to a transaction, agreement, or important decision. In the financial world, due diligence requires an examination of financial records before entering into a proposed transaction with another party.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Due diligence is a systematic way to analyze and mitigate risk from a business or investment decision. An individual investor can conduct due diligence on any stock using readily available public information. The same due diligence strategy will work on many other types of investments. Due diligence involves examining a company's numbers, comparing the numbers over time, and benchmarking them against competitors. Due diligence is applied in many other contexts, for example, conducting a background check on a potential employee or reading product reviews. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Ellen Lindner 
 
    Understanding Due Diligence    
  Due diligence became common practice (and a common term) in the United States with the passage of the  Securities Act of 1933 . With that law, securities dealers and brokers became responsible for fully disclosing material information about the instruments they were selling. Failing to disclose this information to potential investors made dealers and brokers liable for criminal prosecution. 1 
 
 
  The writers of the act recognized that requiring full  disclosure  left dealers and brokers vulnerable to unfair prosecution for failing to disclose a material fact they did not possess or could not have known at the time of sale.
 
 
  Thus, the act included a legal defense: as long as the dealers and brokers exercised ""due diligence"" when investigating the companies whose equities they were selling, and fully disclosed the results, they could not be held liable for information that was not discovered during the investigation.
 
 
 
 
  Due diligence is performed by equity research analysts, fund managers, broker-dealers, individual investors, and companies that are considering acquiring other companies. Due diligence by individual investors is voluntary. However, broker-dealers are legally obligated to conduct due diligence on a security before selling it.

 Definition 
 An interest rate is the price an entity pays for borrowing money or the fee they charge for lending it, expressed as a percentage. 
    What Is an Interest Rate?    
  In a loan, the interest rate is the percentage of interest relative to the  principal . It is either what lenders charge borrowers or what is earned from deposit accounts.
 
 
  The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis and is expressed as an  annual percentage rate  (APR). 1 
 
 
  An interest rate can also apply to a savings account or a  certificate of deposit  (CD). In this case, a bank or credit union pays a percentage of the funds deposited to the account holder.  Annual percentage yield  (APY) refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts. 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An interest rate also applies to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a deposit account. Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods. A loan that is considered low-risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high-risk will have a higher interest rate. The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. Savings accounts and CDs use compound interest. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   The borrower's credit score, the loan type, and the overall economic conditions are factors that determine interest rates. 
 Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Understanding Interest Rates    
  In lending, interest is a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property. Because of this, an interest rate can be thought of as the ""cost of money."" Higher interest rates make borrowing the same amount of money more expensive.
 
 
 
 
  Interest rates  apply to most lending or borrowing  transactions. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes, fund projects, launch or fund businesses, or pay for college tuition. Businesses take out loans to fund capital projects and expand their operations by purchasing fixed and long-term assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. Borrowed money is repaid either in a lump sum by a pre-determined date or in periodic installments.
 
 
  For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the  cost of debt  for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged.
 
 
  When the loan is considered to be low risk by the lender, the borrower will usually be charged a lower interest rate. If the loan is considered high risk, the interest rate that the borrower is charged will be higher.
 
 
   Important

  Adding bonds can create a more balanced  portfolio  by adding  diversification  and calming  volatility , but the bond market may seem unfamiliar even to the most experienced investors. Many make only passing ventures into bonds because they're confused by the apparent complexity of the bond market and the terminology. Bonds are very simple debt instruments, however.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The bond market can help investors diversify beyond stocks. Some characteristics of bonds include their maturity, their coupon (interest) rate, their tax status, and their callability. Risks associated with bonds include interest rate risk, credit/default risk, and prepayment risk. Most bonds come with ratings that describe their investment grade. 
 
    How Do Bonds Work?    
  A  bond  is simply a loan taken out by a company. The company gets the money from investors who buy its bonds instead of going to a bank. The company pays an interest coupon in exchange for the capital, which is the annual interest rate paid expressed as a percentage of the face value. The company pays the  interest  at predetermined intervals, usually annually or semiannually, and returns the  principal  on the maturity date, ending the loan.
 
 
  Unlike stocks, bonds can vary significantly based on the terms of their  indenture , a legal document outlining the characteristics of the bond. Each bond issue is different, so it's important to understand the precise terms before investing. There are six important features to look for when considering a bond.
 
 
   Important 
 Bonds are a form of IOU between the lender and the borrower. 
 
 
 
    Types of Bonds    
    Corporate Bonds    
  Corporate bonds refer to the debt securities that companies issue to pay their expenses and raise capital. The yield of these bonds depends on the  creditworthiness  of the company that issues them. The riskiest bonds are known as  junk bonds , but they also offer the highest returns. Interest from corporate bonds is subject to both federal and state income taxes. 1 2 
 
 
 
 
    Sovereign Bonds    
  Sovereign bonds, or sovereign debt, are debt securities issued by national governments to defray their expenses. The issuing governments are very unlikely to default, so these bonds typically have a very high credit rating and a relatively low yield.

Income: What It Means and How It's Taxed With Examples,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Income is almost anything you receive in exchange for sales or services and most of it is taxable but there are a few exceptions. 
    What Is Income?    
  The term income refers to any type of compensation or benefit received in exchange for work performed or for capital invested. Income can come in the form of the money you receive from your employer or the payments you receive on your investments. Income can be divided into several categories, including gross versus net income and earned versus unearned income. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Income is a form of compensation or benefits received for work performed or from investments. Money earned from an employer and dividends/interest are all forms of income. Gross income is money received before deductions while net income is take-home pay after all deductions. Earned income is money you work for while unearned income is a form of passive income, such as investment income. Federal governments and some states in the U.S. tax income at different rates. 
 
    How Income Works    
  Income is any compensation you receive in exchange for performing services, selling goods, or investing your money. Compensation is usually in the form of money, but it can also come in other forms. The paycheck you receive from your employer is considered income. Dividends and interest from your investments are also considered a form of income.
 
 
  Federal and most state governments want to collect a percentage of these transactions and they do so in the form of taxation. According to the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) , income is ""money, property, goods or services."" It indicates that most income is taxable even if you don't use it right away or if it's paid to someone else on your behalf. 1 
 
 
  Most people think of their weekly, biweekly, or monthly paychecks when they hear the word income but it can go beyond that. Income includes distributions from investments and retirement plans, and even that bottle of wine you might have accepted for walking your neighbor's dog for them. In most cases, you must report it to the IRS and pay taxes on it. 
 
 
 
 
    Types of Income    
    Gross Income vs. Net Income    
  Your employer may pay you a salary of $2,000 weekly but it's highly unlikely that they'll hand you a paycheck in that amount. They'll make several deductions from this amount for taxes and other obligations such as contributions you might make to a retirement plan or insurance premiums. 
 
 
  The initial amount before deductions is your gross income. What remains after deductions are made is referred to as your net income.
 
 
    Unearned Income vs. Earned Income    
   Unearned income  is typically derived from investments. As the name implies, it is money you didn't work for, although you may have worked for the dollars you invested. This includes  dividends , taxable interest, capital gains, and retirement plan distributions. It also includes benefits such as the taxable portion of any Social Security you might collect or unemployment compensation.
 
 
   Earned income  is paid to you in exchange for working or performing a service. You're required to complete and submit a Form W-4 when you begin a new job, detailing personal factors like your marital status and how many dependents you have. This information affects how much your employer will withhold in the way of income taxes and send to the government on your behalf. 
 
 
    Ordinary Income vs. Capital Gains    
  Earned and unearned income fall into the category of ordinary income.  Capital gains  are income received from the sale of capital assets such as real estate or stocks.
 
 
  Assume you purchased a parcel of land years ago for $100,000. It's since appreciated in value and you sell it for $200,000. You've realized a $100,000 capital gain and you must pay tax on that gain but not at the same rate that applies to your ordinary income. Some capital gains have their own tax rates and they can be much kinder than ordinary income tax rates depending on your overall income. The rates increase as your income increases.
 
 
  Most capital gains are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% but some exceptions exist for items like collectibles and qualified small business stock. These are taxed at a rate of 28% as of 2025. You can subtract  capital losses  from this type of income as well if you lose money on an investment subject to more rules. 2  Compare this to ordinary income tax rates ranging from 10% to 37% as of 2025. 3 
 
 
  Capital gains tax rates apply only if you own the asset in question for more than one year before you sell it. You must pay tax at your ordinary income tax rate if you own the asset for one year or less. The difference can be that one single day that exceeds a year. 2 
 
 
    How Income Is Taxed    
  Several types of income are categorized in the  Internal Revenue Code (IRC)  and each can be subject to its own tax terms, obligations, and rules. In the United States,","By

    History of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)    
  President Abraham Lincoln created the Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1862 to collect  taxes  levied to fund the Civil War. In 1863, its first year in operation, it collected $39.1 million (the equivalent of $985.79 million today). 1 2 
 
 
  In 1913, Congress was given the power to enact income  tax laws , paving the way for the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The first Form 1040 followed in 1914. 3 1 
 
 
  The agency’s name was changed to the Internal Revenue Service in 1953. The  filing deadline  was changed to April 15 the next year (1954). 3

    Collecting Revenue    
  The IRS collects estimated taxes from wage earners throughout the year via payroll deductions and quarterly estimated tax payments from businesses based on quarterly tax filings. An annual filing, usually due by April 15 for the previous tax year, reconciles the amounts paid by each individual and business and the actual amounts owed.
 
 
  If the  taxpayer  has overpaid, the IRS issues a  tax refund . If the taxpayer owes money, the payment is due with the annual tax return. The  IRS website  explains how federal tax laws work. U.S. taxpayers must comply with tax laws passed by Congress and meet tax obligations. 4

  The contribution margin can be stated on a gross or per-unit basis. It represents the incremental money generated for each product/unit sold after deducting the variable portion of the firm's costs.
 
 
  The contribution margin is computed as the selling price per unit minus the  variable cost  per unit. Also known as dollar contribution per unit, the measure indicates how a particular product contributes to the overall profit of the company.
 
 
  It provides one way to show the profit potential of a particular product offered by a company and shows the portion of sales that helps to cover the company's fixed costs. Any remaining revenue left after covering fixed costs is the profit generated.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The contribution margin represents the portion of a product's sales revenue that isn't used up by variable costs, and so contributes to covering the company's fixed costs. The concept of contribution margin is one of the fundamental keys in break-even analysis. Low contribution margins are present in labor-intensive companies with few fixed expenses, while capital-intensive, industrial companies have higher fixed costs and thus, higher contribution margins. 
 
    Formula and Calculation of Contribution Margin    
  The contribution margin is computed as the difference between the sale price of a product and the variable costs associated with its production and sales process. This is expressed through the following formula: 
 C = R − V \begin{aligned}&\textbf{C}=\textbf{R}-\textbf{V}\end{aligned} ​ C = R − V ​ 
 Where  C  is the contribution margin,  R  is the total revenue, and  V  represents variable costs. 
 It may also be useful to express the contribution margin as a fraction of total revenue. In this case, the contribution margin ratio (CR) is expressed as the contribution margin divided by total revenues in the same time period: 
 CR = (R − V) R \begin{aligned}&\textbf{CR}=\frac{\textbf{(R}-\textbf{V)}}{\textbf{R}}\end{aligned} ​ CR = R (R − V) ​ ​ 
 
 
 
 
    What Contribution Margin Can Tell You    
  The contribution margin is the foundation for  break-even analysis  used in the overall cost and sales price planning for products.

  The contribution margin helps to separate out the fixed cost and profit components coming from product sales and can be used to determine the selling price range of a product, the profit levels that can be expected from the sales, and structure sales commissions paid to sales team members, distributors, or commission agents.
 
 
    Fixed Cost vs. Variable Cost    
  Fixed costs are costs that are incurred independent of how much is sold or produced. The business pays them to establish itself and exist. Buying items such as machinery is   a typical example of a fixed cost, specifically a one-time fixed cost.
 
 
  Regardless of how much it is used and how many  units are sold , its cost remains the same. However, these fixed costs become a smaller percentage of each unit's cost as the number of units sold increases.
 
 
  Another common example of a fixed cost is the rent paid for a business space. A store owner will pay a  fixed monthly cost  for the store space regardless of how many goods are sold.
 
 
  On the other hand, variable costs are costs that depend on the amount of goods and services a business produces.

"11th District Cost of Funds Index: What It is, How It Works","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the 11th District Cost of Funds Index?    
  The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) was a monthly index that reflected the average interest rate paid by savings institutions in Arizona, California, and Nevada on checking and savings accounts. It was one of many indices used by mortgage lenders to adjust the interest rate on  adjustable rate mortgages  (ARM) and was launched in 1981. With an ARM mortgage, the interest rate on a mortgage moves up and down along with some standard interest rate chosen by the lender, and COFI was one of the most popular indices in the western states.
 
 
  Published on the last day of each month, the COFI represented the  cost of funds  for Western savings institutions that were members of  Federal Home Loan Bank  of San Francisco, a self-regulatory agency, and satisfied the Bank's criteria for inclusion in the index. The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco stopped publishing the COFI on Jan. 31, 2022. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) created a replacement index called the Enterprise 11th District COFI Replacement Index. 
 
 
    Understanding the 11th District COFI    
  The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) was computed using several different factors, with interest paid on savings accounts comprising the largest weighting in the average. As a result, the index tended to have low volatility and follow market interest rate changes somewhat slowly; it was generally regarded as a two-month lagging indicator of market interest rates. The interest rate on a mortgage would not match the COFI, rather the ARM rate that was typically 2% to 3% higher than COFI, depending on the borrower's credit history, the size and terms of the loan, the ability of the borrower to negotiate with the bank, and many other factors.
 
 
  Because was computed using data from three western states, the COFI was primarily used in the western U.S., while the 1-year Treasury index was the measure of choice in the eastern region.

    What Is White-Collar Crime?    
  White-collar crime is a nonviolent crime often characterized by deceit or concealment to obtain or avoid losing money or property, or to gain a personal or business advantage.
 
 
  Examples of white-collar crimes include securities fraud, embezzlement, corporate fraud, and money laundering. Entities that investigate white-collar crime include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and state authorities. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 White-collar crime is a nonviolent crime of deceit or concealment to obtain or avoid losing money or to gain a personal or business advantage. Securities fraud, embezzlement, corporate fraud, and money laundering are white-collar crimes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and state authorities investigate white-collar crime. 
 
    Understanding White-Collar Crime    
  ""White-collar crime"" is a term first coined by sociologist Edwin Sutherland in 1939 who defined it as a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status during his occupation. White-collar workers historically held non-laboring office positions while blue-collar workers traditionally wore blue shirts and worked in plants, mills, and factories. 1 
 
 
  High-profile individuals convicted of white-collar crimes include  Ivan Boesky , Bernard Ebbers,  Michael Milken , and  Bernie Madoff . Their crimes have included insider trading, accounting scandals, securities fraud, and  Ponzi schemes .
 
 
  Rampant new white-collar crimes facilitated by the Internet include so-called  Nigerian scams , in which fraudulent emails request help in forwarding a substantial amount of money to a criminal ring. Other common white-collar crimes include  tunneling ,  insurance fraud , and identity theft.

    Corporate Fraud    
  Large-scale corporate fraud that occurs in corporate or government institutions incurs a significant financial loss to investors and can damage the U.S. economy and investor confidence.
 
 
 
 
   Corporate fraud  gathers the widest group of partners for investigations, including the FBI, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. 3 
 
 
    Falsification of Financial Information    
  The majority of corporate fraud cases involve  accounting schemes  that are conceived to deceive investors, auditors, and analysts about the true financial condition of a corporation or business by manipulating financial data, share price, or other measurements to inflate the financial performance of the business.
 
 
  In 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to helping U.S. citizens avoid taxes by hiding income from the Internal Revenue Service and paid penalties of $2.6 billion. Bank of America sold billions in  mortgage-backed securities  (MBS) tied to properties with inflated values without proper collateral and agreed to pay $16.65 billion in damages. 4 5 
 
 
    Self-Dealing    
   Self-dealing  occurs when a fiduciary acts in their own best interest rather than in the best interest of their clients. Considered a conflict of interest, this illegal activity can lead to litigation, penalties, and termination of employment for those who commit it.
 
 
  Self-dealing includes  front-running , when a broker enters into a trade with the foreknowledge of a non-publicized transaction that will influence the price of the asset, resulting in a financial gain for the broker. It also occurs when a broker or analyst buys or sells shares for their account ahead of their firm's buy or sell recommendation to its clients.
 
 
   Insider trading  occurs when individuals act upon or divulge to others information that is not yet public and is likely to affect share price and company valuations once it is known. Insider trading provides an unfair advantage for individuals to profit and does not matter how the material nonpublic information was received or if the person is employed by the company.

Relative Strength Index (RSI) Indicator Explained With Formula,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The RSI is a momentum oscillator that is widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction. 
  The relative strength index (RSI) is a  momentum indicator  used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security.
 
 
  The RSI is displayed as an  oscillator  (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book,  New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. 1 
 
 
  In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition.
 
 
  The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it is generally available on most trading platforms offered by  online stock brokers. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The relative strength index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator introduced in 1978. 
 The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and is often plotted below the graph of an asset’s price. 
 An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30. 
 In some situations, the RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above the oversold line can be seen by traders as a signal to buy or sell. 
 The RSI works best in  trading ranges  rather than trending markets. 
 
 
    How the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Works    
   As a momentum indicator , the relative strength index compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. 2  The RSI, especially when  used in conjunction with other technical indicators , can help traders make better-informed trading decisions. 3

    Calculating RSI    
  The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula: 2 
 R S I step one = 1 0 0 − [ 1 0 0 1 + Average gain Average loss ] RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right] R S I step one ​ = 1 0 0 − [ 1 + Average loss Average gain ​ 1 0 0 ​ ] 
 The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss. 
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. 4  For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%.  The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%. 
 The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation: 
 5 5 . 5 5 = 1 0 0 − [ 1 0 0 1 + ( 1 % 1 4 ) ( 0 . 8 % 1 4 ) ] 55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ] 5 5 . 5 5 = 1 0 0 − ⎣ ⎢ ⎡ ​ 1 + ( 1 4 0 . 8 % ​ ) ( 1 4 1 % ​ ) ​ 1 0 0 ​ ⎦ ⎥ ⎤ ​ 
 Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly  trending market . 
 R S I step two = 1 0 0 − [ 1 0 0 1 + ( Previous Average Gain × 1 3 )   +   Current Gain ( ( Previous Average Loss × 1 3 )   +   Current Loss ) ] RSI_{\text{step two}} = 100 - \left [ \frac{ 100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \text{Previous Average Gain} \times 13 \right ) \ + \ \text{Current Gain} }{ \left ( \left ( \text{Previous Average Loss} \times 13 \right ) \ + \ \text{Current Loss} \right ) } } \right ] R S I step two ​ = 1 0 0 − [ 1 + ( ( Previous Average Loss × 1 3 )   +   Current Loss ) ( Previous Average Gain × 1 3 )   +   Current Gain ​ 1 0 0 ​ ] 
 
 
    Plotting RSI    
  After the RSI is calculated, the RSI indicator can be plotted, usually beneath an asset’s price chart, as shown below. The RSI will rise as the number and size of up days increase. It will fall as the number and size of down days increase.

 Definition 
 A treasury bill is a U.S. government debt security that matures in less than one year. They are issued by the U.S. Treasury. 
    What Is a Treasury Bill?    
  A Treasury bill (T-bill) is a short-term U.S. government debt obligation. Terms range from four to 52 weeks. T-bills are issued at a discount from the par value, also known as the face value.
 
 
  Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $100. However, some can reach a maximum denomination of $5 million in non-competitive bids. The Treasury sells T-bills during auctions using competitive and non-competitive bidding processes.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $100 and can reach a maximum denomination of $10 million. T-bill rates depend on interest rate expectations. Investors can buy T-bills in electronic form from TreasuryDirect, the U.S. Treasury's platform.

    How to Buy Treasury Bills    
  The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues T-bills to raise cash to fund the federal government's spending. T-bills are generally held either until the  maturity date  or cashed before maturity. Investors can buy T-bills in electronic form from a brokerage firm, generally with a small fee, or directly from TreasuryDirect, the online platform of the U.S. Treasury. Here are the steps to do so:
 
 
   Gather the following information : Your Social Security number or taxpayer identification number (TIN), a U.S. address, and checking or savings account numbers you'll use for your payments. Visit TreasuryDirect.gov : If you already have an account, proceed to step six. Select the account type : You'll select among individual, business, estate, organizational, or trust. Enter your personal information : Your TIN, U.S. address, and bank account details. Create a username and password : You'll use these to set up your TreasuryDirect account. Verify your account : After verification, log in and click on the ""Buy Direct"" tab. Make your choice : Select ""Treasury bonds"" as the security you wish to buy, along with the desired amount. Click ""Buy.""  Review and confirm : You'll be directed to a page where you'll review the details of your purchase. Carefully check for accuracy. Submit the order : You may be asked to accept terms and conditions, after which you'll click to send in your order. 
 
 
 
 
  After submitting your order, you should receive an on-screen confirmation indicating your request has been processed. You'll get an email from TreasuryDirect confirming your purchase and providing a transaction summary. Your payment will typically be settled the next day. At maturity, the yield from your Treasury bond will be automatically deposited into your linked account.

"Periodic Interest Rate: Definition, How It Works, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Periodic Interest Rate?    
  A periodic interest rate is a rate that can be charged on a loan, or realized on an investment over a specific period of time. Lenders typically quote interest rates on an annual basis, but the  interest compounds  more frequently than annually in most cases. The periodic interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods.
 
 
   Important 
 A greater number of compounding periods allows interest to be earned on or added to interest a greater number of times. 
 
 
 
    How a Periodic Interest Rate Works    
  The number of compounding periods directly affects the periodic interest rate of an investment or a loan. An investment's periodic rate is 1% if it has an effective annual return of 12% and it compounds every month. Its periodic interest rate is 0.00033 if you are compounding the daily periodic rate, it would be the equivalent of 0.03%.
 
 
  The more frequently an investment compounds, the more quickly it grows. Imagine that two options are available on a $1,000 investment. Under option one, the investor receives an 8% annual interest rate and the interest compounds monthly. Under option two, the investor receives an 8.125% interest rate, compounded annually.
 
 
  By the end of a 10-year period, the $1,000 investment under option one grows to $2,219.64, but under option two, it grows to $2,184.04. The more frequent compounding of option one yields a greater return even though the interest rate is higher in option two.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Lenders typically quote interest rates on an annual basis, but the interest compounds more frequently than annually in most cases. Interest on mortgages usually compounds monthly. Credit card lenders typically calculate interest based on a daily periodic rate so the interest rate is multiplied by the amount the borrower owes at the end of each day. 
 
    Example of a Periodic Interest Rate    
  The  interest on a mortgage  is compounded or applied on a monthly basis. If the annual interest rate on that mortgage is 8%, the periodic interest rate used to calculate the interest assessed in any single month is 0.08 divided by 12, working out to 0.0067 or 0.67%.
 
 
 
 
  The remaining principal balance of the mortgage loan would have a 0.67% interest rate applied to it each month.
 
 
    Types of Interest Rates    
  The annual interest rate typically quoted on loans or investments is the nominal interest rate—the periodic rate  before  compounding has been taken into account. The effective interest rate is the actual interest rate after the effects of compounding have been included in the calculation.
 
 
  You must know a loan's nominal rate and the number of compounding periods to calculate its  effective annual interest rate . First, divide the nominal rate by the number of compounding periods. The result is the periodic rate. Now add this number to 1 and take the sum by the power of the number of compounding interest rates. Subtract 1 from the product to get the effective interest rate.
 
 
  For example, if a mortgage compounds monthly and has a nominal annual interest rate of 6%, its periodic rate is 0.5%. When you convert the percentage to a decimal and add 1, the sum is 1.005. This number to the 12th power is 1.0617. When you subtract 1 from this number, the difference is 0.0617 or 6.17%. The effective rate is slightly higher than the nominal rate.
 
 
  Credit card lenders typically calculate interest based on a daily periodic rate. 1  The interest rate is multiplied by the amount the borrower owes at the end of each day. This interest is then  added to that day's balance , and the whole process happens again 24 hours later—when what the borrower owes is typically more unless they have made a payment because now their balance includes the previous day's interest. These lenders often quote an annual percentage rate (APR), glossing over this  daily periodic rate calculation . You can identify your daily periodic rate by dividing the APR by 365, although some lenders determine daily periodic rates by dividing by 360.
 
 
    Special Consideration    
  Some revolving loans offer a "" grace period "" from accumulating interest, allowing borrowers to pay off their balances by a certain date within the billing cycle without further interest compounding on their balances. 2  The date and duration of your grace period, if any, should be clearly identified in your contract with the lender.

    What Is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?    
  The compound annual growth rate is the  rate of return  that an investment would need to have every year in order to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, over a given time interval. The CAGR assumes that any profits were reinvested at the end of each period of the investment’s life span.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time. It measures a smoothed rate of return. Investors can compare the CAGR of two or more alternatives to evaluate how well one stock performed against other stocks in a peer group or a market index. CAGR is thus a good way to evaluate how different investments have performed over time, or against a benchmark. The CAGR does not, however, reflect investment risk. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Alex Dos Diaz 
 
    How to Calculate Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)    
   C A G R = ( ( E V B V ) 1 n − 1 ) × 1 0 0 where: E V = Ending value B V = Beginning value n = Number of years \begin{aligned}&CAGR=\left(\left(\frac{EV}{BV}\right)^{\frac1n}-1\right)\times100\\&\textbf{where:}\\&EV=\text{Ending value}\\&BV=\text{Beginning value}\\&n=\text{Number of years}\end{aligned} ​ C A G R = ( ( B V E V ​ ) n 1 ​ − 1 ) × 1 0 0 where: E V = Ending value B V = Beginning value n = Number of years ​ 
 To calculate the CAGR of an investment: 
 
 Divide the value of an investment at the end of the period by its value at the beginning of that period. 
 Raise the result to an exponent of one divided by the number of years. 
 Subtract one from the subsequent result. 
 Multiply by 100 to convert the answer into a percentage. 
 
 The CAGR formula gives an annualized rate of return, which is useful for comparing the performance of different investments over time.
 
 
    What the CAGR Can Tell You    
  The compound annual growth rate isn’t a true return rate, but rather a representational figure. It is essentially a number that describes the rate at which an investment would have grown if it had grown at the same rate every year and the profits were reinvested at the end of each year. For stock market investors, this can be particularly useful in comparing the performance of different stocks. The CAGR does not take into account the discount rate, which is critical in assessing the present value of future returns.
 
 
 
 
  In reality, this sort of performance is unlikely. However, the CAGR can be used to smooth returns so that they may be more easily understood and compared to alternative methods.

 Definition 
 A hedge fund is an actively managed investment that pools money from accredited investors and seeks high returns by using complex strategies and significant risk. 
    What Is a Hedge Fund?    
  A hedge fund is an actively managed private investment fund whose money is pooled and managed by professional fund managers. These managers use a wide range of strategies, including  leverage  and the trading of nontraditional assets, to earn above-average investment returns. Investing in hedge funds is often considered a risky alternative investment choice and usually requires a high minimum investment or  net worth . Hedge funds typically target wealthy investors.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Hedge funds are actively managed funds focused on alternative investments that commonly use risky investment strategies. Investing in a hedge fund is generally open to accredited investors with a high minimum investment or net worth. Hedge funds charge higher fees than conventional investment funds. Hedge fund strategies depend on the fund manager and relate to equity, fixed-income, and event-driven investment goals. A hedge fund investment is usually locked up for a year before shares can be sold. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Julie Bang / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Hedge Funds    
  Hedge funds pool money that is managed to  outperform  average market returns. The fund manager often hedges the fund’s positions to protect them from market risk. This is done by investing some of the assets in securities whose prices move in the opposite direction of the fund’s core holdings. So, if the core holdings' prices drop, the securities' prices should rise. As a result, the hedge can offset any losses in the core holdings.
 
 
  For example, a hedge fund that focuses on a  cyclical sector , such as travel, may invest a portion of its assets in a noncyclical sector, such as energy, aiming to use the positive returns of the noncyclical stocks to offset any losses in cyclical stocks.
 
 
  Hedge funds use risky strategies,  leverage , and  derivative  securities like options and futures. Therefore, a hedge fund investor is commonly considered an  accredited investor . This means that they meet a required minimum level of income or assets. Typical investors are institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and wealthy individuals.
 
 
 
 
  Investments in hedge funds are considered  illiquid  as funds often require investors to lock their money in for at least one year—a time known as the lock-up period. Withdrawals may also only happen at certain intervals such as quarterly or biannually. 1

"Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program Basics","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program is a federal system that offers income support to retirees, people with disabilities, and their families, funded through payroll taxes. It is commonly known as Social Security. 
    What Is the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program?    
  The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program is the official name for Social Security in the United States. The federal OASDI tax noted on your paycheck funds this program that provides benefits to retired adults and people with disabilities, and to their spouses, dependents, and survivors.
 
 
  The goal of the program is to partially replace income that is lost due to old age, the death of a spouse (or qualifying ex-spouse), or disability.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is the official, though little-used name of the Social Security program in the U.S. The program provides benefits to retired adults and people with disabilities, and to their dependents. OASDI taxes, also known as the FICA payroll tax, fund the program from workers' wages and employer contributions. Individuals and employers split the Social Security taxes, while self-employed individuals are responsible for both portions. The amount of an individual’s monthly Social Security payment is based on their earnings during their working years. 
 
    How the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program Works    
  The U.S. Social Security program (including both retirement and disability income) was ushered in through the  Social Security Act  signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Aug. 14, 1935, when the U.S. economy was in the depths of the  Great Depression . The program has grown massively over the decades, along with the U.S. population and economy. 1 2 3 
 
 
  In 1940, about 222,000 people received an average monthly benefit of $22.60. The average monthly benefit was $1,976 in January 2025. The benefit amount is reviewed annually and adjusted for inflation. 4 5 
 
 
 
 
  It is the largest such system in the world and is also the biggest expenditure in the federal budget, costing around $1.4 trillion in 2024. Nearly nine out of 10 individuals age 65 and older receive  Social Security benefits . 6 7

  The Social Security tax rate is 6.2% for employees and 12.4% for the self-employed. The combined federal tax rates for Social Security and  Medicare  are 7.65% and 15.3% for employees and self-employed, respectively. 11

 The  Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund  for retirement payments 
 The  Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund  for disability payments 
 
 
  These trust funds pay out the benefits and invest the remainder of the revenue they collect. 12 
 
 
   Note 
 There is a cap on annual earnings for which you pay Social Security tax. The maximum earnings subject to the tax were $168,600 in 2024 and are $176,100 in 2025. Income above those amounts is not subject to further OASDI tax. 13 
 
    OASDI Program Criteria    
  The OASDI program provides payments to people who meet certain criteria. For old-age payments, money is paid to qualifying persons starting as early as age 62. Full retirement age depends on the individual's birth date and is 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later. 14 
 
 
  Qualifying persons who wait until age 70 (but no later) to begin collecting benefits collect higher, maximum benefits due to delayed retirement credits. 15 
 
 
  Payments are calculated based on people's past wages earned. Survivors' payments are made to surviving spouses or dependents of deceased workers. Disability payments are made to eligible persons who are no longer able to participate in a substantially gainful activity and who meet additional criteria. 16 17 
 
 
  To qualify for retirement benefits, a worker must be fully insured. A worker becomes fully insured by accumulating credits (also called quarters) of co","By

"Quality of Earnings: Definition, Why It’s Important, and Analysis","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Quality of Earnings?    
  A company’s quality of earnings is revealed by dismissing any  anomalies , accounting tricks, or one-time events that may skew the real bottom-line numbers on performance. Once these are removed, the  earnings  that are derived from higher sales or lower costs can be seen clearly.
 
 
  Even factors external to the  company  can affect an evaluation of the quality of earnings. For example, during periods of high inflation, quality of earnings is considered poor for many or most companies. Their sales figures are inflated, too.
 
 
  In general, earnings that are calculated conservatively are considered more reliable than those calculated by  aggressive accounting  policies. Quality of earnings can be eroded by accounting practices that hide poor sales or increased  business risk .
 
 
  Fortunately, there are  generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) . The more closely a company sticks to those standards, the higher its quality of earnings is likely to be.
 
 
  Several major financial scandals, including  Enron  and  WorldCom , have been extreme examples of poor earnings quality that misled investors.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A company’s real quality of earnings can only be revealed by spotting and removing any anomalies, accounting tricks, or one-time events that skew the numbers. Quality of earnings is the percentage of income that is due to higher sales or lower costs. An increase in net income without a corresponding increase in cash flow from operations is a red flag. Tracking activity from the income statement through to the balance sheet and cash flow statement is a good way to gauge quality of earnings. 
 
    Importance of Quality of Earnings    
  One number that analysts like to track is  net income . It provides a point of reference for how well the company is doing from an earnings perspective. If net income is higher than it was the previous quarter or year, and if it beats analyst estimates, it’s a win for the company.
 
 
 
 
  But how reliable are these earnings numbers? Due to the myriad of  accounting conventions , companies can manipulate earnings numbers up or down to serve their own needs.
 
 
  Some companies manipulate earnings downward to reduce the taxes they owe. Others find ways to artificially inflate earnings to make them look better to analysts and investors.
 
 
  Companies that manipulate their earnings are said to have poor or low earnings quality. Companies that do not manipulate their earnings have a high quality of earnings. This is because as a company’s quality of earnings improves, its need to manipulate earnings to portray a certain financial state decreases. However, many companies with high earnings quality will still adjust their financial information to minimize their tax burden.
 
 
  As noted above, companies with high quality of earnings stick with the GAAP standards. The fundamental qualities of those standards are reliability and relevance. That is:
 
 
   Reliability : The metric is verifiable, free from error or bias, and accurately represents the transaction. Relevance : The metric is timely and has predictive power. It can confirm or contradict prior predictions and has value when making new predictions. 
 
 
    Analysis of Quality of Earnings    
  There are many ways to gauge the quality of earnings by studying a company’s annual report.
 
 
  Analysts usually start at the top of the  income statement  and work their way down. For instance, companies that report high sales growth may also show high growth in credit sales. Analysts are wary of sales that are due only to loose credit terms. (Changes in credit sales, or accounts receivable, can be found on the  balance sheet  and  cash flow statement .)
 
 
  Working down the income statement, analysts then might look for variations between operating  cash flow  and net income. A company that has a high net income but negative cash flows from operations is achieving those apparent earnings somewhere other than sales.
 
 
  One-time adjustments to net income, also known as nonrecurring income or expenses, are another red flag. For example, a company may decrease expenses in the current year by refinancing all of its  debt  into a future balloon payment. This would lower debt expense and increase net income for the current year while pushing the repayment problem down the road. Naturally, long-term investors don’t care for that move.
 
 
    Example of Earnings Manipulation    
  A company can manipulate popular earnings measures such as  earnings per share (EPS)  and  price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio  by buying back shares of its own stock, which reduces the number of shares outstanding. In this way, a company with declining net income may be able to post EPS growth.
 
 
  When earnings per share go up, the price-to-earnings ratio goes down. This should signal that the stock is  undervalued . It doesn’t, though, if the company changed the number by si","By

"Term Loan Definition, Types, and Common Attributes","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A term loan is financing with fixed or variable interest rates that provides borrowers with a lump sum of cash upfront, which they repay over a specified period. 
    What Is a Term Loan?    
  A term loan provides borrowers with a lump sum of cash upfront in exchange for specific borrowing terms. Term loans are normally meant for established small businesses with sound  financial statements . In exchange for a specified amount of cash, the borrower agrees to a certain repayment schedule with a fixed or  floating interest rate . Term loans may require substantial  down payments  to reduce the payment amounts and the total cost of the loan.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A term loan provides borrowers with a lump sum of cash upfront in exchange for specific borrowing terms. Borrowers agree to pay their lenders a fixed amount over a certain repayment schedule with either a fixed or floating interest rate. Term loans are commonly used by small businesses to purchase fixed assets, such as equipment or a new building. Borrowers prefer term loans because they offer more flexibility and lower interest rates. Short and intermediate-term loans may require balloon payments while long-term facilities come with fixed payments. 
 
    Understanding Term Loans    
  Term loans are commonly granted to small businesses that need cash to purchase equipment, a new building for their production processes, or any other  fixed assets  to keep their businesses going. Some businesses borrow the cash they need to operate on a month-to-month basis. Many banks have established term loan programs specifically to help companies in this way.
 
 
  Business owners apply for term loans the same way they would any other credit facility—by approaching their lender. They must provide statements and other financial evidence demonstrating their  creditworthiness . 1  Approved borrowers get a  lump sum  of cash and are required to make payments over a certain period of time, usually on a monthly or quarterly repayment schedule. 
 
 
  Term loans carry a fixed or  variable interest rate  and a set maturity date. If the proceeds are used to finance the purchase of an asset, the  useful life  of that asset can impact the repayment schedule. The loan requires collateral and a rigorous approval process to reduce the risk of  default  or failure to make payments. As noted above, some lenders may require down payments before they advance the loan.
 
 
 
 
  Borrowers often choose term loans for several reasons, including:
 
 
   Simple application process Receiving an upfront lump sum of cash Specified payments Lower interest rates 
 
 
  Taking out a term loan also frees up cash from a company's cash flow in order to use it elsewhere.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Variable-rate term loans are based on a benchmark rate like the U.S. prime rate or the  London InterBank Offered Rate  (LIBOR). 
 
 
 
    Types of Term Loans    
  Term loans come in several varieties, usually reflecting the lifespan of the loan. These include:
 
 
 
 Short-term loans:  These types of term loans are usually offered to firms that don't qualify for a line of credit. They generally run less than a year, though they can also refer to a loan of up to 18 months. 2 
 Intermediate-term loans:  These loans generally run between one to three years and are paid in monthly installments from a company’s  cash flow . 
 Long-term loans:  These loans last anywhere between three to 25 years. They use company assets as  collateral  and require monthly or quarterly payments from profits or cash flow. They limit other financial commitments the company may take on, including other debts,  dividends , or principals' salaries, and can require an amount of profit set aside specifically for loan repayment. 
 
 
  Both short- and intermediate-term loans may also be balloon loans and come with  balloon payments . This means the final installment swells or balloons into a much larger amount than any of the previous ones.
 
 
   Important 
 While the principal of a term loan is not technically due until maturity, most term loans operate on a specified schedule requiring a specific payment size at certain intervals. 
 
 
 
    Example of a Term Loan    
  A  Small Business Administration  (SBA) loan, officially known as a 7(a) guaranteed loan, encourages long-term financing. Short-term loans and revolving credit lines are also available to help with a company’s immediate and cyclical working capital needs. 1 
 
 
  Maturities for long-term loans vary according to  the ability to repay , the purpose of the loan, and the useful life of the financed asset. Maximum  maturity dates  are generally 25 years for real estate, up to 10 years for working capital, and 10 years for most other loans. The borrower repays the loan with monthly principal and interest payments. 3 
 
 
  As with any loan, an SBA fixed-rate loan payment remains the same because the interest rate is constant. Conversely, a variabl","By

    What Is Unlimited Liability?    
  Unlimited liability refers to the full legal responsibility that business owners and partners assume for all business debts. This  liability  isn't capped and obligations can be paid through the seizure and sale of the owners’ personal assets without the protection that the popular limited liability business structure provides.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An unlimited liability company includes general partnerships and sole proprietors who are equally responsible for all debt and liabilities accrued by the business. Most companies opt to form limited partnerships in which a partner's liability can't exceed their investment in the company. Nondisclosure is a benefit of forming a foreign unlimited liability subsidiary for many companies.  
 
    Understanding Unlimited Liability    
  Unlimited liability typically exists in  general partnerships  and  sole proprietorships . It provides that each business owner is equally responsible for whatever debt accrued within a business if the company is unable to repay or defaults on its debt. An owner's personal wealth can be seized to cover the balance owed.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Most companies opt to form limited partnerships or limited liability companies instead where one or more business partners are only liable up to the amount of money they've invested in the company. 1 
 
 
 
    An Example of Unlimited Liability    
  Consider four individuals who are working as partners. Each invests $35,000 into the new business that they own jointly. The company accrues $225,000 in liabilities over one year. All four partners are equally liable for repayment of the $225,000 if the company can't repay and/or defaults on these debts. The owners would be required to come up with $56,250 each to alleviate the $225,000 in debt, in addition to their initial investment of $35,000.
 
 
    Unlimited Liability Laws Worldwide    
  Unlimited liability companies are typically found in jurisdictions where company law stems from English law. Unlimited liability companies are incorporated or formed through registration under the Companies Act of 2006 in the United Kingdom. 2 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Other areas where these companies are formed under English law include Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, India, and Pakistan. 
 
 
 
  Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and two jurisdictions in Canada are also areas where unlimited liability companies are commonly formed, but they're referred to as  unlimited liability corporations  in Canada.
 
 
  Despite the number of companies and countries in which they exist, unlimited companies are an uncommon form of company incorporation due to the burden placed on owners to cover a company's debt, specifically when the company faces liquidation.
 
 
  One of the benefits of forming an unlimited liability subsidiary may be nondisclosure. Etsy, an online crafts marketplace, created an Irish subsidiary in 2015 that's classified as an unlimited liability company. Public reports on money that the company moves through Ireland or tax payment amounts are therefore no longer required. 3 
 
 
    Joint Stock vs. Unlimited Liability    
  A  joint-stock company (JSC ) is similar to an unlimited liability company in the U.S. because shareholders have unlimited liability for company debts. JSCs operate under associations in New York and in Texas under the Texas Joint-Stock Company/Revocable Living Trust model, as well as in other states. 4","0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unlimited-liability.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
What Public Limited Company (PLC) Means in the U.K.,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Public Limited Company (PLC)?    
  A public limited company (PLC) is a type of public company that's allowed to offer its shares to the public and is listed on a stock exchange. PLC is the equivalent of a U.S. publicly traded company that carries the Inc. or corporation designation.
 
 
  The use of the phrase “public limited company” or the PLC abbreviation after a company's name is mandatory. This signals to investors and other parties that the business is publicly traded and subject to stringent financial regulations and reporting requirements. 1 
 
 
  As PLCs, companies gain the ability to raise money by selling shares to the public. Still, they may also face greater scrutiny and regulatory requirements, along with the potential for conflicting interests among shareholders and the risk of hostile takeovers. 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 PLC stands for public limited company, a designation used for public companies in the U.K. All companies listed on the London Stock Exchange are structured as PLCs. Any retail investor has the opportunity to buy stock in a PLC. Unlike privately held companies, public companies must regularly publish certain financial data and disclosures for the public. Well-known U.K. brands, like Burberry and Shell, include ""PLC"" in their official names to indicate their public company status. 
 
    How a Public Limited Company (PLC) Works    
  A PLC refers to a company that has  offered shares of stock  to the general public. Shareholders in a PLC benefit from having limited liability, meaning their financial risk is limited to the amount they invested in the company's shares. 3 
 
 
  In the U.K., a PLC operates similarly to a public  corporation  in the U.S. Its operations are strictly regulated, and it must publish periodic reports to shareholders and prospective shareholders on its true financial condition. 4 
 
 
    Requirements for a PLC    
  Under U.K. company law, a PLC must have the PLC or “public limited company” designation after the company name and maintain a minimum share capital of £50,000. 5 6  Like a publicly traded company in the U.S., PLCs offer various types of shares, such as ordinary shares (similar to U.S. common stock) and cumulative preference shares (which function like preferred stock).
 
 
 
 
  A key step in becoming a PLC is ‘floating on the stock exchange,’ where shares are made available for public purchase. Shareholders, who become part owners, have limited liability and a voice in company operations, overseen by a CEO and board of directors. 7 8 
 
 
   Important 
 The largest PLCs make up the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Index, known as the  Footsie . The FTSE 100 tracks the top 100 U.K.-listed companies by market capitalization. It's often viewed as a key indicator of the U.K. economy, much like the S&P 500 in the U.S. 
 
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of a PLC    
  The biggest advantage of forming a public limited company (PLC) is that it allows the company to raise capital by issuing public shares. A listing on a public stock exchange attracts interest from hedge funds, mutual funds, professional traders, and individual investors. This leads to greater access to investment capital for a company than a private limited company can typically achieve.
 
 
  However, there's much more regulation for a PLC in the U.K. than for a public corporation in the U.S. PLCs are required to hold annual general meetings open to all shareholders and are held to higher standards of transparency in accounting. 9  Because they’re public, they’re also vulnerable to pressure from shareholders and takeover bids from rivals.
 
 
  By becoming a PLC, a company is given greater access to capital, and shareholders are offered liquidity. These benefits are similar to those of a U.S. company going public. On the downside, PLCs also face increased scrutiny, more reporting requirements, and potential volatility in their valuation due to market fluctuations—similar to companies that go public in the U.S. 10 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pros 
 
 
 A U.K. company can raise more capital by being a PLC. 
 Provides shareholders with increased liquidity. 
 Greater ability to raise capital and pursue acquisitions by offering shares. 
 
 
 
 
 Cons 
 
 
 Increased scrutiny and regulation. 
 Larger number of shareholders to be accountable to. 
 Higher volatility in valuation due to dependence on financial markets. 
 
 
 
 
    Public Limited Company (PLC) vs. Private Limited Company (LTD)    
  A PLC is a public company in the U.K., while a private limited company (LTD) is privately held. Unlike PLCs, shares of LTDs aren't offered to the general public. 11  
 
 
  Private companies are still incorporated, generally with Companies House. They must still have legal documents and at least one director to form the business. 
 
 
  To raise capital via a public investment in the U.K. a company must be a PLC. PLCs are like LTDs, except they're publicly traded, wit","By

 The law of demand states that as the price of a good rises, consumers will demand correspondingly lower quantities of that good. 
    What Is the Law of Demand?    
  The law of demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics. Alongside the  law of supply , it explains how market economies allocate resources and determine the prices of goods and services.
 
 
  The law of demand states that the quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. This occurs because of  diminishing marginal utility . 1  That is, consumers use the first units of an economic good they purchase to serve their most urgent needs first, then they use each additional unit of the good to serve successively lower-valued ends. 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Demand is derived from the law of diminishing marginal utility, the fact that consumers use economic goods to satisfy their most urgent needs first. A market demand curve expresses the sum of quantity demanded at each price across all consumers in the market. Changes in price can be reflected in movement along a demand curve, but by themselves, they don't increase or decrease demand. The shape and magnitude of demand shifts in response to changes in consumer preferences, incomes, or related economic goods, not usually to changes in price. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   The law of demand assumes that factors like consumer income, tastes, and the prices of related goods remain constant. 
 Jessica Olah / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding the Law of Demand    
   Economics  involves the study of how people use limited means to satisfy unlimited wants. The law of demand focuses on those unlimited wants. Naturally, people prioritize more urgent wants and needs over less urgent ones in their economic behavior, and this carries over into how people choose among the limited means available to them.
 
 
  For any economic good, the first unit of that good that a consumer gets their hands on will tend to be used to satisfy the most urgent need the consumer has that that good can satisfy.
 
 
 
 
  For example, consider a castaway on a desert island who obtains a six-pack of bottled fresh water that washes up onshore. The first bottle will be used to satisfy the castaway’s most urgently felt need, which is most likely drinking water to avoid dying of thirst.

  The second bottle might be used for bathing to stave off disease, an urgent but less immediate need. The third bottle could be used for a less urgent need, such as boiling some fish to have a hot meal, and on down to the last bottle, which the castaway uses for a relatively low priority, such as watering a small potted plant to feel less alone on the island.
 
 
  Because each additional bottle of water is used for a successively less highly valued want or need by our castaway, we can say that the castaway values each additional bottle less than the one before.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The more units of a good that consumers buy, the less they are willing to pay in terms of price. 
 
 
 
  Similarly, when consumers purchase goods on the market, each additional unit of any given good or service that they buy will be put to a less valued use than the one before, so we can say that th","0 seconds of 1 minute, 47 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"Job Market: Definition, Measurement, Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The job market is the conceptual space where employers seek employees and individuals search for jobs. 
    What Is the Job Market?    
  The job market is the market in which employers search for employees and employees search for jobs. The job market is not a physical place as much as a concept demonstrating the competition and interplay between different labor forces. It is also known as the  labor market .
 
 
  The job market can grow or shrink depending on the demand for labor and the available supply of workers within the overall economy. Other factors which impact the market are the needs of a specific industry, the need for a particular education level or skill set, and required job functions. The job market is a significant component of any economy and is directly tied in with the demand for goods and services.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Employers search for employees and employees search for jobs in the job market. The job market grows or shrinks based on demand for labor and the number of workers in the economy. The job market is directly related to the unemployment rate, a measure of the percentage of people who aren't employed but actively seeking work. 
 
    The Job Market and the Unemployment Rate    
  The job market is also directly related to the  unemployment rate . The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who are not currently employed but actively seeking a job. The higher the unemployment rate, the greater the supply of labor in the overall job market.
 
 
  When employers have a larger pool of applicants to choose from, they can be pickier or force down wages. Conversely, as the unemployment rate drops, employers are forced to compete more heavily for available workers. The competition for workers has the effect of increasing  wages . Wages determined by the job market provide valuable information for economic analysts and those who set public policy based on the state of the overall economy.
 
 
   24.9% 
 The highest rate of unemployment in the U.S, which was documented in 1933. 1 
 
  During difficult economic times, unemployment tends to rise as employers may reduce their staffing numbers and create fewer new jobs, making it harder for people trying to find work. High rates of unemployment can prolong economic  stagnation —a sustained period of little-to-no growth in an economy—and contribute to social upheaval, leading to the loss of opportunities for many individuals to live comfortably.
 
 
 
 
  A report called the Current Population Survey can measure the state of the job market. It's a statistical survey performed every month by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ). The study includes a representative sample of about 60,000 homes to try and determine the unemployment rate of specific regions, earnings of those surveyed, hours the respondents worked, and many other demographic factors. 2 
 
 
    Example of a Job Market    
  The BLS publishes regular snapshots of the job market, titled "" Employment Situation Summaries ."" According to the November 2023 report, total employment for non-farm payrolls rose by 199,000 for the month, and the unemployment rate—which is a  lagging indicator —fell to 3.7%. Industries such as health care and government saw job gains during this time, as did manufacturing, due to return of workers from strikes. Employment in the retail sector fell. 3 
 
 
   How Big Is the U.S. Labor Market? 
 In October 2023, there were 168.3 million people in the civil labor force, a category that does not include active-duty military personnel, incarcerated individuals, farm workers, and government employees. As a proportion of the total population, this represented an employment participation rate of 62.8 percent. 4 
 
 
   What Does a Tight Job Market Mean? 
 Job markets are often referred to as being ""tight."" This means that there are more positions available than unemployed individuals willing to take them on. Conversely, when the unemployment rate is high but there are few job vacancies, the job market can be described as ""slack"" or ""loose."" 
 
 
   What Is the Job Vacancy Rate in the U.S.? 
 According to BLS, the job openings rate on the last business day of October 2023 was 5.3%, a slight decrease compared to the last month. Sectors that saw job decreases include health care and social assistance, finance and insurance, and real estate and rental and leasing. 5 The job openings rate is calculated by dividing the number of job openings by the sum of both filled and unfilled job, represented as a percentage. 6 
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  The job market is a concept for understanding how employers seek employees and vice versa. It considers at the availability of jobs and workers, as well as other factors that can shape employment, such as competition for skilled workers or training requirements for employees. It's directly related to the unemployment rate, a metric that measures the number of people","By

"Yacht Insurance: What It Means, How It Works","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Yacht Insurance?    
  Yacht insurance is an insurance policy that provides indemnity  liability coverage  for a sailing vessel. It includes liability coverage for bodily injury or damage to the property of others and damage to personal property on the vessel. Depending on the insurance provider, this insurance could also include gas delivery, towing, and assistance if your yacht gets stranded.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Yacht insurance provides indemnity liability coverage for a sailing vessel. It has two principal parts: hull insurance and protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance. While there is no legal agreed upon length that separates a yacht from a pleasure boat, generally it is considered to be somewhere between 27 and 30 feet. 
 
    Understanding Yacht Insurance    
  Some companies specialize in providing coverage for antique and classic boats. You can choose between an  actual cash value  or  agreed value  policy. The former is cheaper but factors in depreciation and market value, so your payout will be less. 1 2  Some policies include discounts based on your boating education, safety features, and whether you have a hybrid or electric boat. Some companies also offer a  package deal  that decreases the rate on a yacht insurance policy if you purchase additional policies, such as for your home or car. 3 
 
 
  Boats are defined as vessels under 197 feet long, while ships are 197 feet long or longer. There is no agreed upon  length for a yacht , but they are generally considered to be at least 30 feet long. A vessel under 27 feet is considered a pleasure boat. 4  
 
 
  Although there isn't a standard definition of what the size of a yacht is, we can see that there is a general agreement within a range. With that being said, this general range falls within class 2 and class 3 of the Federal boat classification system. 5 
 
 
  For its own purposes, the National Boat Owners Association marks the dividing line at 27 feet. Most yacht coverage is broader and more specialized than pleasure boat coverage, because larger vessels travel farther and are exposed to greater risks. 2 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Yacht insurance is broader and more specialized than pleasure boat coverage, due to the fact that a yacht can sail farther and thus runs greater risks. 
 
 
 
  A yacht insurance deductible, the amount of money you must pay out of your own pocket before your insurance kicks in, is usually a percentage of the insured value. A 1% deductible, for example, means that a boat insured for $100,000 would have a $1,000 deductible. Most lenders allow a maximum deductible of 2% of the insured value. 6 
 
 
  Generally, yacht insurance coverage does not include wear and tear, gradual deterioration, marine life, marring, denting, scratching, animal damage, osmosis, blistering, electrolysis, manufacturer’s defects, defects in design, and ice and freezing. 7 
 
 
    Two Parts of Yacht Insurance    
  There are two principal sections of a yacht insurance policy.
 
 
    Hull insurance    
  Hull insurance is an all-risk, direct damage coverage that includes an agreed amount of hull coverage. That amount is settled on when the policy is written, and in the case of a total loss it will be paid out in full. 8  In addition, there is  replacement cost  coverage on partial losses, though sails, canvas, batteries, outboards, and sometimes outdrives are not include and instead are subject to depreciation. 9 
 
 
    Protection and indemnity (P&I)    
  Protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance is the broadest of all liability coverages, and because maritime law is particular, you will need coverages that are designed for those exposures. Longshore and harbor workers’ coverage and  Jones Act  coverage (for the yacht’s crew) are included and important, because your losses in these areas could run into six figures. P&I will cover any judgements against you and also pays for your defense in  admiralty courts . 9 10

 Definition 
 The ROA is a ratio commonly expressed as a percentage that compares a company’s net income with its assets. 
    What Is the Return on Assets (ROA) Ratio?    
  The return on assets (ROA) ratio shows how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profits. It reveals what earnings are generated from  invested capital . A higher ROA means a company is more efficient and productive at managing its balance sheet to generate profits. A lower ROA indicates there's room for improvement.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Return on assets (ROA) measures how well a company uses assets like buildings and equipment to generate revenue. ROA is calculated by dividing net income by total assets. Investors should compare the ROA of companies within the same sector because they share the same asset base. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Theresa Chiechi / Investopedia 
 
    How the Return on Assets (ROA) Ratio Works    
  Businesses are about  efficiency . Comparing profits to revenue is a useful operational metric, but comparing them to the resources a company used to earn them displays the feasibility of that company’s existence. Return on assets is the simplest of these corporate bang-for-the-buck measures.
 
 
  ROA for public companies can vary substantially and is highly dependent on the industry in which they function. The ROA for a tech company won’t necessarily correspond to that of a food and beverage company. It's best to compare a company's ROA against its previous ROA numbers or a similar company’s ROA when using it as a comparative measure.
 
 
  The ROA figure gives investors an idea of how effective the company is in converting the money it invests into net income. The higher the ROA number, the better, because the company can earn more money with a smaller investment. A higher ROA means more asset efficiency.
 
 
  A similar valuation concept is a  return on average assets (ROAA) , which uses the average value of assets instead of the current value of the item. Financial institutions often use ROAA to gauge financial performance.

    Return on Assets Ratio: Formula and Calculation    
  The return on assets ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its total assets. It’s expressed as a formula like this: 
 
 R e t u r n   o n   A s s e t s = N e t   I n c o m e T o t a l   A s s e t s Return\ on\ Assets = \frac{Net\ Income}{Total\ Assets} R e t u r n   o n   A s s e t s = T o t a l   A s s e t s N e t   I n c o m e ​ 
 
 Let's say that Sam and Milan both start hot dog stands. Sam spends $1,500 on a bare-bones metal cart. Milan spends $15,000 on a zombie apocalypse-themed unit, complete with a costume. 
 Let’s assume that those were the only assets each firm deployed. Milan would have the more valuable business, but Sam would have the more efficient one if Sam earned $150 and Milan earned $1,200 over a given period. Sam’s simplified ROA is $150 ÷ $1,500 = 10% using the above formula. Milan’s simplified ROA is $1,200 ÷ $15,000 = 8%. 
 
 
    Special Considerations

"Karl Marx: His Books, Theories, and Impact","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Karl Marx was a philosopher and economist known for his critiques of capitalism, the development of Marxism, and advocating for a classless society. 
  Karl Marx (1818-1883) was a philosopher, author, social theorist, and economist. He is famous for his theories about  capitalism , socialism, and  communism .
 
 
  Marx, in conjunction with  Friedrich Engels , published ""The Communist Manifesto"" in 1848. Later in life, he wrote ""Das Kapital,"" which discussed the labor theory of value. (The first volume was published in Berlin in 1867; the second and third volumes were published posthumously in 1885 and 1894, respectively.)
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Karl Marx was a prominent thinker who wrote on topics related to economics, political economy, and society. Born in Germany, Marx spent much of his time in London, where he wrote many famous works, including ""The Communist Manifesto: and ""Das Kapital."" Marx often collaborated with long-time friend and social theorist Friedrich Engels. Marx is known for his revolutionary writings favoring socialism and a communist revolution. While Marxism and Marxian economics have been largely rejected by the mainstream today, many of Marx's critiques of capitalism remain relevant today. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Joshua Seong 
 
    Early Life and Education    
  Born in Trier, Prussia (now Germany), on May 5, 1818, Marx was the son of a successful Jewish lawyer who converted to Lutheranism before Marx's birth. Marx studied law in Bonn and Berlin, where he was introduced to the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel.
 
 
  He became involved in radicalism at a young age through the Young Hegelians, a group of students who criticized the political and religious establishments of the day. Marx received his doctorate from the University of Jena in 1841. His radical beliefs prevented him from securing a teaching position, so instead, he took a job as a journalist and later became the editor of  Rheinische Zeitung , a liberal newspaper in Cologne.
 
 
 
 
  After living in Prussia, Marx lived in France for some time, and that is where he met his lifelong friend Friedrich Engels. He was expelled from France and then lived briefly in Belgium before moving to London, where he spent the rest of his life with his wife.

  Marx died of bronchitis and pleurisy in London on March 14, 1883, and was buried at Highgate Cemetery in London. His original grave was nondescript, but in 1954, the Communist Party of Great Britain unveiled a large tombstone, including a bust of Marx and the inscription ""Workers of all Lands Unite,"" an anglicized interpretation of the famous phrase in ""The Communist Manifesto"": ""Proletarians of all countries, unite!""
 
 
    Marx's Theories    
  Marx was inspired by classical political economists such as Adam Smith and  David Ricardo . While his own branch of economics, Marxian economics, is not favored among modern mainstream thought,  Marx's ideas  have greatly impacted societies, most prominently in communist projects such as those in the USSR, China, and Cuba. Among modern thinkers, Marx is still very influential in the fields of sociology, political economy, and strands of  heterodox  economics.
 
 
  In general, Marx claimed there are two major flaws inherent in capitalism that lead to the exploitation of workers by employers: the chaotic nature of free market competition and the extraction of surplus labor. Ultimately, Marx predicted that capitalism would eventually destroy itself as more people become relegated to working-class status, inequality rose, and competition would lead the rate of corporate profits to zero. This would lead, he surmised, to a revolution where production would be turned over to the working class as a whole.
 
 
    Exploitation and Surplus Value    
  Marx's work on understanding capitalism as a social and economic system remains a valid critique in the modern era. In ""Das Kapital"" (""Capital"" in English), Marx argues that society is composed of two main classes.
 
 
  Capitalists are the business owners who organize the process of production and who own the means of production such as factories, tools, and raw materials, and who are also entitled to any and all profits. The other, much larger class is composed of labor, which Marx termed the ""proletariat."" Laborers do not own or have any claim to the means of production, the finished products they work on, or any of the profits generated from sales of those products. Instead, labor works only in return for a monetary wage. Marx argued that because of this uneven arrangement, capitalists exploit workers.

"What Is Customer Service, and What Makes It Excellent?","Definition 
 Customer service is the support and assistance that a company provides to its customers before and after purchasing its products or services. 
    What Is Customer Service?    
  Customer service is the support, assistance, and advice provided by a company to its customers both before and after they buy or use   its products or services. Customer service is a critical factor in ensuring buyer satisfaction. It also helps a company retain customers and grow its business.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Customer service is the interaction between the buyer of a product and the company that sells it. Good customer service is critical to business success, ensuring brand loyalty one customer at a time. Recent innovations have focused on automating customer service systems, but the human element is, in some cases, indispensable. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Jessica Olah 
 
    How Customer Service Works    
  At most companies,  customer service representatives  are the only employees who have direct contact with buyers or users. The buyers' perceptions of the company and the product are shaped in part by their experience in dealing with that person. This is why many companies work hard to increase customer satisfaction levels.
 
 
   Successful small businesses  and large companies alike understand the need for excellent customer service instinctively. Here are the key components of excellent customer service:
 
 
 
 Timely attention to issues raised by customers is critical. Requiring a customer to wait in line or sit on hold sours an interaction before it begins and can  ruin their opinion of a business . 
 Customer service should be a single-step process for the consumer. If a customer calls a helpline, the representative should, whenever possible, follow the problem through to its resolution. 
 If a customer must be transferred to another department, the original representative should follow up with the customer to ensure that the problem was solved. 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Customer service should be a one-stop process for the consumer whenever possible. 
 
 
 
    Benefits of Customer Service    
  There are many reasons why it's a good idea to invest in excellent customer service. The following are just some of the main benefits of implementing a customer service program within a company:
 
 
 
 Customer Retention:  The first and most obvious advantage of having a customer service plan in place is to keep customers happy. It means listening to concerns, being empathetic, and streamlining issues related to product availability, payment, returns, and technical support. Showing that a company cares keeps its customers loyal. 
 Employee Retention:  Customer service isn't just for customers. It also helps keep employees with the company. When customers are happy, employees are, too. People tend to want to work for a business that cares about its customers. 
 Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving:  Businesses have to take care of their customers' problems. But companies that take a proactive approach tend to do better. This means that it's important to reach out to customers before any issues arise. This shows that the company cares and is doing all that it can to ensure a smooth customer experience. 
 Referrals:  Consumers who have a good experience might pass on that information to others through word-of-mouth, customer reviews, or  social media . This often helps businesses generate new sales. 
 Brand Boost:  Businesses that show consumers they care through customer service help increase their  brand equity . This leads to more referrals and an increase in sales. 
 Increased Customer Lifetime Value:  This refers to the relationship customer service helps establish and solidify with a single customer. When a company provides someone with good service, that person is more likely to add to the company's revenue by remaining loyal and making more purchases. 
 Corporate Culture:  Customer service allows businesses to streamline their  workflows  and promote cooperation among different teams. This includes communication between agents and managers, technical engineers, and production teams. All of this helps corporations achieve their goals of customer attraction and retention, which increases sales revenue. 
 Competitive Advantage:  Having a good customer service base sets a company apart from its competition. It boosts its reputation and increases its brand value by showing consumers and competitors that the business values the relationships it has with new and existing customers. 
 
 
    Traits of Good Customer Service    
  It isn't enough to have a customer service plan in place. The plan needs to be effectively executed to reap the benefits. But before we look at what effective execution looks like, it's important to understand bad customer service.
 
 
  Bad customer service is any communication or experience where a consumer feels as though they are let down. This includes negative experiences,","By

    What Is EBITDA?    
  EBITDA, short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is an alternate measure of profitability to  net income . It's used to assess a company's profitability and financial performance.
 
 
  EBITDA is not a metric recognized under  generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) . Some public companies report EBITDA in their quarterly results along with  adjusted EBITDA  figures typically excluding additional costs, such as  stock-based compensation .
 
 
  Increased focus on EBITDA by companies and investors has prompted criticism that it overstates profitability. The U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  requires listed companies reporting EBITDA figures to show how they were derived from net income, and it bars them from reporting EBITDA on a per-share basis. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is a measure of core corporate profitability. EBITDA is calculated by adding interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization expenses to net income. Some critics, including Warren Buffett, call EBITDA meaningless because it omits depreciation and capital costs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to reconcile any EBITDA figures they report with net income and bars them from reporting EBITDA per share. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    EBITDA Formulas and Calculation    
  If a company doesn't report EBITDA, it can be easily calculated from its  financial statements . Software like Excel can  make the calculation process easy . 
 The earnings (net income), tax, and interest figures are found on the  income statement , while the  depreciation  and  amortization  figures are normally found in the notes to operating profit or on the  cash flow statement . 
 There are two EBITDA formulas, one based on net income and the other on operating income, both of which will arrive at basically the same result. (Net income is operating income minus non-operating expenses, such as taxes and interest.) 
 The respective EBITDA formulas are: 
 EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + D&A or EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A where: D&A = Depreciation and amortization \begin{aligned}&\text{EBITDA} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Taxes} + \text{Interest Expense} +\text{D\&A}\\&\text{or}\\&\text{EBITDA} = \text{Operating Income} + \text{D\&A}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{D\&A}=\text{\text{Depreciation and amortization}}\end{aligned} ​ EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + D&A or EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A where: D&A = Depreciation and amortization ​ 
 
 
 
 
    What Does EBITDA Actually Tell You?    
  By adding  interest ,  taxes , depreciation, and amortization back to net income, EBITDA can be used to  track and compare the underlying profitability  of companies regardless of their depreciation assumptions or financing choices.

    What Is Unlevered Beta ?    
   Beta  is a measure of market risk. Unlevered beta (or asset beta) measures the market risk of the company without the impact of debt.
 
 
  'Unlevering' a beta removes the financial effects of  leverage  thus isolating the risk due solely to company assets. In other words, how much did the company's equity contribute to its risk profile.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Levered beta (commonly referred to as just beta or equity beta) is a measure of market risk. Debt and equity are factored in when assessing a company's risk profile. Unlevered beta strips off the debt component to isolate the risk due solely to company assets. High debt-to-equity ratio usually translates to an increase in the risk associated with a company's stock. A beta of 1 means that the stock is as risky as the market while betas greater or less than 1 reflect risk thresholds higher or lower than the market, respectively. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Laura Porter 
 
    Understanding Unlevered Beta    
  Beta is the slope of the  coefficient  for a stock regressed against a benchmark  market index  like the  Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index . A key determinant of beta is leverage, which measures the level of a company’s debt to its equity. Levered beta measures the risk of a firm with debt and equity in its  capital structure  to the volatility of the market. The other type of beta is known as  unlevered beta . 
 'Unlevering' the beta removes any beneficial or detrimental effects gained by adding debt to the firm's capital structure.  Comparing companies' unlevered betas  gives an investor clarity on the composition of risk being assumed when purchasing the stock. 
 Unlevered beta (asset beta) = Levered beta (equity beta) ( 1 + ( 1 − tax rate ) ∗ Debt Equity ) \text{Unlevered beta (asset beta)} =\frac{ \text{Levered beta (equity beta)} } {\left( 1 + \frac{\left( 1-\text{tax rate} \right )*\text{Debt}}{\text{Equity}} \right )} Unlevered beta (asset beta) = ( 1 + Equity ( 1 − tax rate ) ∗ Debt ​ ) Levered beta (equity beta) ​ 
 Take a company that is increasing its debt thus raising its debt-to-equity ratio. This will lead to a larger percentage of earnings being used to service that debt which will amplify investor uncertainty about future earnings stream. Consequently, the company's stock is deemed to be getting riskier but that risk is not due to market risk.
 
 
 
 
   Tip 
 Isolating and removing the debt component of overall risk results in unlevered beta. 
 
 
 
  The level of debt that a company has can affect its performance, making it more sensitive to changes in its stock price. Note that the company being analyzed has debt in its financial statements, but unlevered beta treats it like it has no debt by stripping any debt off the calculation. Since companies have different capital structures and levels of debt, an analyst can calculate the unlevered beta to effectively compare them against each other or against the market. This way, only the sensitivity of a firm’s assets (equity) to the market will be factored in.

How Self-Driving Cars Could Change the Auto Industry,"Close 
 
 
 
  Driverless cars have piqued human interest for centuries. Leonardo Da Vinci sketched out the plans for a hypothetical self-driving cart in the late 1400s, and mechanical autopilots for airplanes emerged in the 1930s. 1  At the New York World's Fair, visitors were introduced to the concept of a self-driving car as part of its vision of the future in General Motors ( GM ) Futurama exhibit. 2 
 
 
  Technological advancements in GPS, digital mapping, computing power, and sensor systems have finally made it a reality. But what are the potential impacts of driverless cars on the car industry and the larger economy?
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The widespread adoption of driverless cars has the potential to revolutionize the economy, transform industries, and create new business opportunities. Driverless cars will generate employment in such sectors as software development, data analytics, and autonomous vehicle maintenance. Car manufacturers will need to adapt their business models to emphasize software development, AI integration, and data management. Increased productivity due to optimized travel time can arguably boost economic output, benefiting businesses and individuals alike. 
 
    Understanding Automobile Automation    
  Before we look at impacts to the car industry and general economics, let's cover how driverless cars work. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are equipped with sensors like LiDAR, radar, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors to provide a 360-degree view of their surroundings. These sensors enable them to detect objects, pedestrians, and road conditions in real-time. 3 
 
 
  AVs also rely on high-definition maps and GPS data to plan routes and understand their surroundings.  Artificial intelligence  and machine learning algorithms process the data from sensors and maps, interpreting the environment, identifying objects, and making decisions. Advanced control systems operate AVs safely and precisely, controlling steering, acceleration, and braking based on AI algorithms' decisions. 4 
 
 
  Testing and validation are done via simulations, closed-course testing, and real-world trials to ensure reliability and safety. By combining these technologies, AVs can detect obstacles, recognize traffic signals, navigate complex roadways, and respond to changing conditions. This makes them capable of safely transporting passengers without human intervention, thus disrupting the auto industry and economy. 5 
 
 
 
 
  The table below from the United States Environmental Protection Agency outlines the various levels of self-driving vehicles. 6 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 Level 
 Who Does What, When 
 
 
 Level 1 
 The human driver does all the driving. 
 
 
 Level 2 
 An advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) on the vehicle can sometimes assist the human driver with either steering or braking/accelerating, but not both simultaneously. 
 
 
 Level 3 
 An advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) on the vehicle can itself control both steering and braking/accelerating simultaneously under some circumstances.  The human driver must continue to pay full attention (“monitor the driving environment”) at all times and perform the rest of the driving task. 
 
 
 Level 4 
 An Automated Driving System (ADS) on the vehicle can itself perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment – essentially, do all the driving – in certain circumstances.  The human need not pay attention in those circumstances. 
 
 
 Level 5 
 This is the envisioned ""driverless"" car. An Automated Driving System (ADS) on the vehicle can do all the driving in all circumstances.  The human occupants are just passengers and need never be involved in driving. 
 
 
 
 
 
    Impact on the Automobile and Related Industries    
  The automobile industry has been historically slow to react to technological change. Traditional car makers have been reluctant to develop a full-featured electric car, and start-ups such as Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) have been founded to innovate instead. 7  If self-driving cars become prevalent, it is likely that technology companies such as Google or Apple ( AAPL ) will lead the way and put a serious dent in the profits of traditional car companies such as GM, Ford ( F ) or Toyota ( TM ).
 
 
  Let's look a variety of more specific impacts AVs can have on the automobile industry.
 
 
    Changes to Business Models    
  The emergence of autonomous vehicles can lead to a shift in the traditional business model of the auto industry. It's estimated that the 2023 autonomous vehicle market size is $33.5 billion; it's also forecast that the industry will grow to over $93 billion by 2028. 8 
 
 
  Instead of just manufacturing and selling cars to individual consumers, automakers are exploring new revenue streams through mobility services. This includes developing autonomous ride-hailing services, car-sharing platforms, and  subscription-based models  where customers pay for access to a fleet of autonomous vehicles rather than owni","By

 Definition 
 The accounting equation is a core concept of modern accounting that states that a company's assets are the sum of its liabilities and its shareholder equity. 
    What Is the Accounting Equation?    
  The accounting equation is a fundamental concept that states that a company’s total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and its shareholders’ equity. This straightforward relationship between assets, liabilities, and equity is the foundation of the  double-entry  accounting system.
 
 
  The accounting equation ensures that the balance sheet remains balanced. Each entry made on the debit side has a corresponding entry or coverage on the credit side.
 
 
  The accounting equation is also known as the basic accounting equation or the balance sheet equation.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The accounting equation is considered to be the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. It shows on a company’s balance sheet that a company’s total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Assets represent the valuable resources controlled by a company and the liabilities represent its obligations. Both liabilities and shareholders’ equity show how the assets of a company are financed. Financing through debt shows as a liability and financing through issuing equity shares appears in shareholders’ equity. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Daniel Fishel / Investopedia 
 
    How the Accounting Equation Works    
  The financial position of any business is based on two key components of the  balance sheet : assets and liabilities. Owners’ equity or shareholders’ equity is the third section of the balance sheet. The accounting equation is a representation of how these three important components are associated with each other.
 
 
 
 
  Assets represent the valuable resources controlled by a company and liabilities represent its obligations. Both liabilities and shareholders’ equity detail how the assets of a company are financed. It will show as a liability if it’s financed through debt but in shareholders' equity if it’s financed through issuing  equity  shares to investors.

 The accounting equation helps to assess whether business transactions carried out by the company are being accurately reflected in its books and accounts. 
 
 
 
    Assets    
  Assets include  cash and cash equivalents  or  liquid assets . These may include Treasury bills and certificates of deposit (CDs).
 
 
   Accounts receivable  lists the amounts of money owed to the company by its customers for the sale of its products. Inventory is also considered to be an asset.
 
 
  The major and often largest value assets of most companies are their machinery, buildings, and property. These are fixed assets that are usually held for many years.
 
 
    Liabilities    
  Liabilities are debts that a company owes and costs that it must pay to keep running. Debt is a liability whether it's a long-term loan or a bill that's due to be paid. Costs can include rent, taxes, utilities, salaries, wages, and  dividends  payable.
 
 
    Shareholders’ Equity

 Definition 
 The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical indicator that calculates a security's average price for the day, weighted by trading volume, to analyze price trends and liquidity. 
    What Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)?    
  The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical analysis indicator used on intraday charts that resets at the start of every new trading session. It's the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.
 
 
  VWAP is important because it provides traders with insight into both the price trend and value of a security.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) appears as a single line on intraday charts. 
 It looks similar to a moving average line, but is smoother. 
 VWAP represents a view of price action throughout a single day's trading session. 
 Retail and professional traders may use the VWAP to help them determine intraday price trends. 
 VWAP is a trading  benchmark  that typically is most useful to short-term traders. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou 
 
    Understanding the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)    
  VWAP is calculated by totaling the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the  volume ) and then dividing by the total shares traded. This can be described in a formula such as the following:
 
 
  VWAP = (Sum of (Tick Price ×Tick Volume)) / Trading Volume
 
 
  However, not all traders have a data source that gives them this level of information. Traders and chart vendors often use a substitute formula designed to get close to VWAP.

    Formula    
  Popular charting packages typically use a formula for closely approximating VWAP, such as: 
 VWAP  = Cumulative Typical Price  ×  Volume Cumulative Volume where: Typical Price = High price + low price + closing price/3 Cumulative = Total trades since the trading session opened \begin{aligned}&\textbf{VWAP }\mathbf{= }\frac{\textbf{Cumulative Typical Price }\mathbf{\times}\textbf{ Volume}}{\textbf{Cumulative Volume}}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{Typical Price}=\text{High price}+\text{low price}+\text{closing price/3}\\&\text{Cumulative}=\text{Total trades since the trading session opened}\end{aligned} ​ VWAP  = Cumulative Volume Cumulative Typical Price  ×  Volume ​ where: Typical Price = High price + low price + closing price/3 Cumulative = Total trades since the trading session opened ​ 
 
 
    How to Calculate VWAP    
  By adding the VWAP indicator to a streaming chart, the calculation will be made automatically. However, to calculate the VWAP yourself, follow the steps below.
 
 
  Assume a five-minute chart. The calculation is the same regardless of what intraday time frame is used.
 
 
 
 Find the average price the stock traded at over the first five-minute period of the day. To do this, add the  high, low, and close, then divide by three . Multiply this by the volume for that period. Record the result in a spreadsheet, under column PV (price, volume). 
 Divide PV by the volume for that period. This will produce the VWAP. 
 To maintain the VWAP throughout the day, continue to add the PV value from each period to the prior values. Divide this total by the total volume up to that point.

Economic Indicators You Should Know for Investment,"Close 
 
 
 
   Economic indicators  are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Consistent in their release, wide in their scope and range, metrics such as the  Consumer Price Index  (CPI) and written reports like the  Beige Book  are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. 1 2  Policymakers, most notably those at the  Federal Reserve , use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there. 3  
 
 
  Although investors should get to know economic indicators, the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and  asset allocation . But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, both of which can be very useful to individual investors. 
 
 
    What Is an Economic Indicator?     
  In its simplest form, an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The U.S. economy is essentially a living thing where, at any given moment, there are billions of moving parts—some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. They must always involve a large number of assumptions, no matter what resources are put to the task. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various  economic conditions . There are also indexes for  coincident indicators  and  lagging indicators —the components of each are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic expansion.﻿
 
 
    Use in Tandem, Use in Context    
  Once an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their  relative strengths  and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. For example, in the area of employment, consider using data from several releases. By using the hours-worked data (from the  Employment Cost Index ) along with the  labor report  and  nonfarm payrolls , investors can get a fairly complete picture of the state of the  labor market . 4 
 
 
  Additionally, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new  factory orders  leading to higher factory shipments and higher  durable goods  figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher  personal income  figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the  supply chain  to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release.
 
 
 
 
    Personalizing Your Research    
  Some people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of  pensions  and long-term  Treasury bonds  should be looking for different things than a  stock trader  who rides the waves of the  business cycle . Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages (about 8% to 10% per year).
 
 
  Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as generally knowing the  macroeconomic  forecasts. Forecast numbers can be found at several public websites, such as Yahoo! Finance or MarketWatch. On the day a specific indicator release is made, there will be  press releases  from newswires such as the Associated Press and Reuters, which will present figures with key pieces highlighted.
 
 
  It is helpful to read a report on one of the newswires, which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations,  seasonality  figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use  investment advisors , these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings.
 
 
    Inflation Indicators: Keeping a Watchful Eye    
  Many investors, especially those who invest primarily in  fixed-income securities , are concerned about  inflation . Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the  Producer Price Index  (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 5  Many investors will  use the PPI to try a","By

    What Is the Support Level of a Stock?    
  A support level is the price level that an asset doesn't fall below for a period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price.
 
 
  The simple support level can be charted in technical analysis by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The support level represents a price point that an asset struggles to fall below over a given time. Support levels can be visualized using different technical indicators or by simply drawing a line connecting the lowest lows for the period. Applying trendlines or incorporating moving averages provides a more dynamic view of support. It can be a sign of reversal if a breach occurs on an uptrend. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Torsten Asmus / Getty Images 
 
    What Do Support Levels Tell You?    
  Support level is the level at which buyers tend to purchase or  enter  into a stock. It refers to the stock share price that a company rarely goes below. The support level holds and is confirmed when the price of a stock falls toward its support level or the stock continues to decline. The previously demonstrated support level must change to incorporate the new lows when this occurs.
 
 
  Support and  resistance  levels are at the core of technical analysis. Fundamental analysis takes a company's performance and history into account to determine the future direction of the stock. Technical analysis uses patterns and trends in price. 1 
 
 
   Important 
 Support levels in stocks can be created by  limit orders  or the market action of traders and investors. 
 
 
 
  Traders use support and resistance levels to plan entry and exit points for trades. Depending on what the trader sees from other indicators, it can be an opportunity to buy in or take a short position if the price action on a chart breaches the support levels. It may even be a sign of a  reversal  if the breach occurs on an uptrend.
 
 
 
 
    Example of How to Use Support Levels    
  Let’s say you're studying the price history of shares in the fictional Montreal Trucking Company with the ticker symbol MTC. You're trying to identify an ideal time to enter a long position in the company.
 
 
  MTC has traded between $7 and $15 per share over the last year. The stock climbs to $15 during the second month of the period you’re studying MTC but it's fallen to $7 by month 4. It climbs again to $15 by month 7 before falling to $10 in month 9. It climbs again to $15 by month 11 and it falls to $13 over the next 30 days before climbing again to $15. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 
 
  You've established a support level of $7 and a resistance at $15 at this point. You can set a buy order at the lower end of the range if there are no other worrying factors on the technicals or fundamentals. There's a risk that an uptrend will be established if you set the order right at the support level of $7. Your order may never be executed even though you correctly identified the upside. It's important to consult more nuanced indicators in addition to simple support.

"Exchange-Traded Product (ETP): Definition, Types, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Exchange-traded products trade on exchanges and track underlying securities, indexes, or other financial products. 
    What Is an Exchange-Traded Product (ETP)?    
  Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are financial securities that track underlying securities, an index, or other financial products. ETPs trade on  exchanges  similar to stocks, which means they can be bought and sold, and their share prices can fluctuate throughout the trading day. ETP share prices are derived from the underlying investments that they track.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Exchange-traded products are instruments that track underlying security, index, or financial products. ETPs trade on exchanges similar to stocks. The price of ETPs fluctuates from day to day and intraday. The share price of ETPs comes from the underlying investments that they track. 
 
    Types of Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs)    
  Exchange-traded products can be benchmarked to myriad investments, including commodities, currencies, stocks, and  bonds . They can contain a few or hundreds of underlying investments. Here are the types of ETPs trading on the market.
 
 
    Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)    
  An  exchange-traded fund (ETF)  is a basket of investments that can include stocks and bonds. It usually tracks an underlying index, such as the  S&P 500 , but can follow an industry, sector, commodity, or even a currency. An ETF's price can rise and fall just like other investments. ETFs trade throughout the day. 1 
 
 
  Since ETFs are passively managed, they come with low fees, making them popular with investors. A  passively managed  ETF may track the S&P 500 index. An ETF that mirrors this index will generally hold all stocks listed on the index, but some funds hold more or less than the index lists, such as Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF, which held 505 stocks on April 30, 2025, while the S&P 500 listed 504. 2 3 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 In January 2024, the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  approved the first Bitcoin Spot ETFs, allowing fund managers to hold Bitcoin and offer exchange-traded shares to investors on official exchanges. 4 
 
 
 
  In an  actively managed  fund (which an ETF can also be), the fund manager is responsible for maintaining fund performance by replacing non-performers with better performers, which can lead to higher fees—the managers need to be paid for their time, and there might be some trading fees to pass on. Some ETFs share a combination of both passive and active attributes. 5 
 
 
  For example, actively managed ETFs are a hybrid investment vehicle that merges actively managed mutual funds with the trading flexibility associated with ETFs.
 
 
    Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)    
   Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) , like ETFs, generally track an underlying index and trade on major exchanges. They track unsecured debt securities and are issued as bonds, which pay the return of their original invested amount or principal at  maturity  and any generated returns.
 
 
  ETNs do not pay periodic interest payments (called coupon payments). As a result, the likelihood that investors will be paid back the principal and the returns from the underlying index depends on the issuer's  creditworthiness . 6 
 
 
  Different tax treatments apply to the various types of ETPs. Investors should speak with a tax professional for any potential tax ramifications from investing in ETPs.
 
 
    Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs)    
   Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)  are financial instruments designed to offer investors exposure to commodity prices. These instruments can be structured as either ETFs or ETNs. ETCs are traded on stock exchanges, allowing investors to easily access and trade them just like they were individual stocks.
 
 
  The underlying assets of ETCs typically include a range of commodities such as precious metals, agricultural products, energy resources, or a combination thereof. ETCs let investors buy and sell commodities without holding or owning any of the underlying commodities. As such, investors can capitalize on specific commodities, indexes, or  futures contracts  without having to store or hold a tangible commodity. 7 
 
 
    Exchange-Traded Products vs. Mutual Funds    
   Mutual funds  are typically priced at the end of the trading day when orders are filled. ETP shares trade like stocks with price movements throughout the day. For example, an investor can place a buy or sell order for an ETF share at a specific price with a broker or buy the ETF in the morning and sell it by the end of the day.
 
 
  Mutual funds can be purchased and sold during the day but are not priced until the market closes. ETPs also often carry lower expense ratios than their mutual fund counterparts. 1 
 
 
  Differences in the bid and ask price (or the buy and sell price) could add to the cost of trading ETPs. Some no-load or no-fee mutual funds, on the other hand, can be bought and sold without any trading commissi","By

"Variability: Definition in Statistics and Finance, How to Measure","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Variability measures how the values in a dataset are clustered around their average value. 
    What Is Variability?    
  Variability measures how the points in a distribution diverge, or vary, from their mean value and each other. In finance, it is most often applied to the variability of investment returns.
 
 
  Understanding the variability of investment returns is just as important to professional investors as the value of the returns themselves. Investors equate a high variability of returns to a higher degree of risk when investing.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Variability refers to the divergence of data from its mean value, and is commonly used in the statistical and financial sectors.  Variability in finance is most commonly applied to variability of returns, wherein investors prefer investments that have higher return with less variability. Variability is used to standardize the returns obtained on an investment and provides a point of comparison for additional analysis. 
 
    Understanding Variability    
  Professional investors perceive the risk of an  asset class  to be directly proportional to the variability of its returns. As a result, investors demand a greater return from assets with higher variability of returns, such as stocks or commodities, than what they might expect from assets with lower variability of returns, such as Treasury bills.
 
 
  This difference in expectation is also known as the  risk premium . The risk premium refers to the amount required to motivate investors to place their money in higher-risk assets. If an asset displays a greater variability of returns but does not show a greater rate of return, investors will not be as likely to invest money in that asset.
 
 
  Variability in statistics refers to the difference being exhibited by data points within a data set, as related to each other or as related to the mean. This can be expressed through the range, variance or standard deviation of a data set. The field of finance uses these concepts as they are specifically applied to price data and the returns that changes in price imply.
 
 
 
 
  The range refers to the difference between the largest and smallest value assigned to the variable being examined. In statistical analysis, the range is represented by a single number. In financial data, this range is most commonly referring to the highest and lowest price value for a given day or another time period. The standard deviation is representative of the spread existing between price points within that time period, and the variance is the square of the standard deviation based on the list of data points in that same time period.
 
 
    Variability in Investing    
  One measure of reward-to-variability is the  Sharpe ratio , which measures the excess return or risk premium per unit of risk for an asset. In essence, the Sharpe ratio provides a metric to compare the amount of compensation an investor receives with regard to the overall risk being assumed by holding said investment. The excess return is based on the amount of return experienced beyond investments that are considered free of risk. All else being equal, the asset with the higher Sharpe ratio delivers more return for the same amount of risk.

    What Is the Velocity of Money?    
  The velocity of money is the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. It is commonly measured by the number of times that a unit of currency moves from one entity to another within a given period of time. Simply put, it's the rate at which consumers and businesses in an economy collectively spend money.
 
 
  The velocity of money is usually measured as a ratio of  gross domestic product  (GDP) to a country's M1 or M2  money supply . The word velocity is used here to reference the speed at which money changes hands.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Velocity of money is a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. The velocity of money is typically higher in expanding economies and lower in contracting economies. To calculate velocity of money, economists divide GDP by money supply. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
    Understanding the Velocity of Money    
  The velocity of money is important for measuring the rate at which money in circulation is being used for purchasing goods and services. It is used to help economists and investors gauge the health and vitality of an economy. High money velocity is usually associated with a healthy, expanding economy. Low money velocity is usually associated with recessions and contractions.
 
 
  Economists use the velocity of money to measure the rate at which money is used for goods and services in an economy. While it is not necessarily a key economic indicator, it can be followed alongside other key indicators that help determine economic health like GDP, unemployment, and inflation.  GDP and the money supply  are the two components of the velocity of money formula.
 
 
   Economies  that exhibit a higher velocity of money relative to others tend to be more developed. The velocity of money is also known to fluctuate with business cycles. When an economy is in an expansion, consumers and businesses tend to more readily spend money causing the velocity of money to increase. When an economy is contracting, consumers and businesses are usually more reluctant to spend and the velocity of money is lower.

  Since the velocity of money is typically correlated with business cycles, it can also be correlated with key indicators. Therefore, the velocity of money will usually rise with  GDP and inflation . Alternatively, it is usually expected to fall when key economic indicators like GDP and inflation are falling in a contracting economy.
 
 
    Example of Velocity of Money    
  Consider an economy consisting of two individuals, A and B, who each have $100 of money in cash. Individual A buys a car from individual B for $100. Now B has $200 in cash money. Then B purchases a home from A for $100 and B enlists A's help in adding new construction to their home and for their efforts, B pays A another $100. Individual A now has $200 in cash. Individual B then sells another car to A for $100 and both A and B end up with $100 in cash. Thus, both parties in the economy have made transactions worth $400, even though they only possessed $100 each.
 
 
  In this economy, the velocity of money would be two, resulting from the $400 in transactions divided by the $200 in money supply.

  More than 60% of American households own stocks today, either directly or through investment funds. 1  Yet for many people, the world of investing is still mysterious, with unfamiliar terms and concepts.
 
 
  The good news is that successful investing doesn't require advanced math skills or complex strategies. Instead, it starts with understanding the basic building blocks of investing—known as asset classes—and how they fit together. From the relative safety of a savings account to the growth potential of stocks, each type has different potentials for risk and rewards.
 
 
  Understanding where these different assets stand on the investment risk ladder can give you a solid foundation for getting started in investing. We'll take you through this below.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Given the wide variety of available assets, investing can be daunting for beginners. Every investment sits somewhere on the risk ladder, with cash being the safest but lowest-returning option and alternative investments typically being the riskiest but with the potential for the highest returns. Sticking with index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the market is often the best path for a newer investor. The stock market has historically delivered higher returns than bonds over long periods, but it has had greater short-term risks and far wider price swings. Investment experts recommend spreading money across different types of investments (diversification) rather than putting everything into one category.

    Understanding the Investment Risk Ladder    
  Here are the major asset classes, in order of ascending risk, on the investment risk ladder.
 
 
    Cash    
  A bank deposit is the safest and easiest investment asset to understand—it's also usually the first one we have. It not only gives investors a detailed account of the interest that they'll earn but also guarantees that they’ll get their capital back. On the downside, the  interest  earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation.

  Certificates of deposit (CDs) are less  liquid , but they typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts. However, the money put into a CD is locked up for some time (months to years), and usually come with penalties for early withdrawal. 2

 Financial advisors often start off with clients suggesting they plan for the long haul.

    Bonds    
  A  bond  is a debt instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower.

 Definition 
 Equity is the remaining value of an asset or investment after considering or paying any debt owed; the term is also used to refer to capital used for funding or a brand's value. 
    What Is Equity?    
  In finance, equity refers to an ownership stake whose value is reduced by an associated debt. For homeowners,  home equity  refers to the value of a property minus the balance of any mortgages or debts.
 
 
  In the stock market,  shareholders' equity  (or owners' equity for privately held companies) represents the difference between a company's assets and liabilities. If all of the company's assets were liquidated and used to pay off debts, the shareholders' equity is the amount that would be left over. In the case of an acquisition, it is the value of company sales minus any liabilities owed by the company that are not transferred with the sale.
 
 
  In addition, shareholder equity can represent the book value of a company. Equity can sometimes be offered as payment-in-kind. It also represents the pro-rata ownership of a company's shares. Equity can be found on a company's balance sheet and is one of the most common pieces of data employed by analysts to assess a company's financial health.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Equity represents the value that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all its assets were liquidated and all its debts were paid off. You can also think of equity as a degree of residual ownership in a firm or asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset. Equity represents the shareholders' stake in the company, identified on a company's balance sheet. The calculation of equity is a company's total assets minus its total liabilities, and it is used in several key financial ratios, such as the Return on Equity (ROE). Home equity is the value of a homeowner's property (net of debt) and is another way the term equity is used. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Katie Kerpel 
 
    How Shareholder Equity Works    
  By comparing concrete numbers reflecting everything the company owns and owes, the ""assets-minus-liabilities"" shareholder equity equation paints a clear picture of a company's finances, easily interpreted by investors and analysts. 1  Equity is used as capital raised by a company, which is then used to purchase assets, invest in projects, and fund operations. A firm typically can raise capital by issuing debt (in the form of a loan or via bonds) or equity (by selling stock). Investors usually seek out equity investments as they provide a greater opportunity to share in the profits and growth of a firm.
 
 
 
 
  Equity is important because it represents the value of an investor's stake in a company, represented by the proportion of its shares. Owning stock in a company gives shareholders the potential for capital gains and dividends. Owning equity will also give shareholders the right to vote on corporate actions and elections for the board of directors. These equity ownership benefits promote shareholders' ongoing interest in the company.

"Netting: Definition, How It Works, Types, Benefits, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Netting reduces risks in financial contracts by combining multiple financial obligations to arrive at a net obligation amount. 
    What Is Netting?    
  Netting entails offsetting the value of multiple positions or payments due to be exchanged between two or more parties. It can be used to determine which party is owed remuneration in a multiparty agreement. Netting is a general concept that has a number of more specific uses, including in the financial markets.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Netting is used in a number of settings and instances including securities or currency trading, bankruptcy, and inter-company transactions. Netting can involve more than two parties, called multilateral netting. It generally involves a central exchange or clearinghouse. It's commonly accomplished in one of four ways. 
 
    How Netting Works    
  Netting is a method of reducing risks in financial contracts by combining or aggregating multiple financial obligations to arrive at a net obligation amount. Netting is used to reduce settlement, credit, and other financial risks between two or more parties. 
 
 
  Netting is often used in trading, where an investor can offset a position in one security or currency with another position either in the same security or a different one. The goal of netting is to  offset losses in one position with gains in another . For example, if an investor is short 40 shares of a security and long 100 shares of the same security, the position is net long 60 shares.
 
 
  Netting is also used when a company files for  bankruptcy  whereby the parties tend to net the balances owed to each other. This is also called a set-off clause or set-off law. In other words, a company doing business with a defaulting company may offset any money they owe the defaulting company with money that’s owed them. The remainder represents the total amount owed by them or to them, which can be used in bankruptcy proceedings.
 
 
  Companies can also use netting to simplify third-party invoices, ultimately reducing multiple invoices into a single one. For example, several divisions in a large transport corporation purchase paper supplies from a single supplier, but the paper supplier also uses the same transport company to ship its products to others. By netting how much each party owes the other, a single invoice can be created for the company that has the outstanding bill. This technique can also be used when transferring funds between  subsidiaries .
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Netting saves a great deal of time by eliminating the need to process multiple transactions, reducing the number of transactions down to one. 
 
 
 
    Types of Netting    
  Here are the top four ways netting is used:
 
 
    Close-Out Netting    
  Close-out netting happens after  default , which is when a party fails to make principal and interest payments. Transactions between the two parties are netted to arrive at a single amount for one party to pay the other. In close-out netting, the existing contracts are terminated, and an aggregate terminal value is calculated and paid as one lump sum.
 
 
    Settlement Netting    
  Also known as payment netting, settlement netting aggregates the amount due among parties and nets the cash flows into one payment. In other words, only the net difference in the aggregate amounts is delivered or exchanged by the party with the net owed obligation. Typically, a payment netting agreement must be in place before the settlement date. Otherwise, each of the individual payments would be due to and from all parties involved.
 
 
    Netting by Novation    
   Novation  netting cancels offsetting swaps and replaces them with new obligations. In other words, if two companies have obligations due to each other on the same value date (or settlement date), the net amount is calculated. However, instead of simply sending the net difference to the party owed, novation netting cancels the contracts and books a new one for the net or aggregate amount. The new aggregate contract under novation netting makes it distinctly different from payment netting, which does not book a new contract; instead, the net aggregate amount is exchanged.
 
 
    Multilateral Netting    
   Multilateral netting  is netting that involves more than two parties. In this case, a clearinghouse or central exchange is often used. Multilateral netting can also occur within one company with multiple subsidiaries. If the subs owe payments to each other for various amounts, they can each send their payments to a central corporate entity or netting center. The main office would net the invoices and the various currencies from the subsidiaries and make the net payment to the parties that are owed. Multilateral netting involves pooling the funds from two or more parties so that a more simplified invoicing and payment process can be achieved.

"War Bonds: Characteristics, History, Pros & Cons, Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a War Bond?    
  A war bond is a debt security issued by a government to finance military operations during times of war or conflict. Because war bonds offered a rate of return below the market rate, investment was achieved by making emotional appeals to patriotic citizens to lend the government money.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A war bond is an initiative by a government to fund military operations and spending by issuing debt for the public to purchase. The public may buy these bonds out of a feeling of patriotic duty, or other emotional appeals. Although war bonds do not typically pay interest, they are sold at a discount and mature to face value, typically after a period of 10 to 30 years. 
 
    Understanding War Bonds    
  A war bond is a debt instrument issued by a government as a means of borrowing money to finance its defense initiatives and military efforts during times of war. A war bond is essentially a loan to a government.
 
 
  The bonds were sold below their face value—investors paid less than the face value initially and were paid the face value amount at maturity. In other words, war bonds were considered  zero-coupon bonds  because they didn't pay interest payments throughout the year or coupon payments. Instead, investors earned the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the bond at maturity.
 
 
  War bonds were baby bonds, which meant they had a smaller  par value , or face value, than standard bonds. This made them more affordable for retail investors. Another feature of the bonds was that they were nontransferable—only the bond purchaser could redeem the bonds in the future. War bonds originally had a 10-year maturity, which resulted in a 2.9% return.
 
 
  Congress extended the interest that could be earned so that bonds sold from 1941 to 1965  accrued interest  for 40 years. Bonds issued after 1965 accrued interest for 20 years. After the end of World War II, War Bonds became known as Series E bonds. The U.S. government continued issuing Series E bonds until 1980 when Series EE bonds replaced them.
 
 
    Characteristics of War Bonds    
  War bonds issued by the United States were a little different from other Treasury securities.
 
 
 
 
  War bonds (or Liberty bonds, depending on the year) were  zero-coupon securities , meaning that they did not pay any interest over the lifetime of the bond. Moreover, the face value was different from the actual price of the bond: You would buy the bond at a discount (typically between 50%-75% of the bond's face value) and receive the full face value when the bond matured.
 
 
  The exact maturity date would depend on the year a war bond was issued. A bond issued at the beginning of World War II could only be cashed out ten years later. Congress later amended the law so that war bonds could continue to accumulate interest over 40 years.
 
 
    The History of War Bonds    
  Besides the United States government, other countries also issued war bonds, including Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Austria-Hungary.
 
 
  In the U.S., the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Motives to purchase war bonds were embedded in patriotism and conscience, given that these bonds offered a rate of return that was below the prevailing interest rates in the market.
 
 
  Advertisements for the bonds were carried out through multiple media such as radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and newsreels in theaters to reach the American people. Hollywood stars like Bette Davis and Rita Hayworth helped promote war bonds by touring the country. People could save up for War Bonds by contributing 25 cents each time. The Girl Scouts also sold stamps valued at 10 cents each. Norman Rockwell created several paintings as part of the advertising effort for War Bonds.
 
 
  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Ukrainian government announced an issue of war bonds to pay fighters and other military expenses. On March 1, just after the invasion began, the Ukrainian government announced that it had raised $270 million from a one-year bond with a yield of 11%. 1  The country issued several successive bond issues, raising a total of nearly $1 billion. 2 
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of War Bonds    
  War bonds allow the issuing government to quickly raise money to fund military campaigns. Governments that issue war bonds may appeal to patriotic feelings to sell the war bonds, allowing them to offer a yield that is lower than current market rates. They can also be used to reduce inflation by removing extra money from the economy.
 
 
  For investors, war bonds can also be a way to profit by speculating on the outcome of a war. If one side suffers from a temporary military defeat, investors can buy that country's war bonds if they expect a quick reversal. However, they also take the risk of losing their investment if the war is lost.

 Definition 
 A debenture is unsecured debt issued by corporations or governments that relies on the issuer's creditworthiness and reputation rather than collateral to support its value. 
    What Is a Debenture?    
  A debenture is a type of bond or other debt instrument that is unsecured by  collateral . Since debentures have no collateral backing, they must rely on the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer for support. Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A debenture is a type of debt instrument that is not backed by any collateral and usually has a term greater than 10 years. Debentures are backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer. Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds. Some debentures can convert to equity shares while others cannot.

    Understanding Debentures    
  Similar to most bonds, debentures may pay periodic interest payments called coupon payments. Like other types of bonds, debentures are documented in an  indenture . An indenture is a legal and binding contract between bond issuers and  bondholders .
 
 
  The contract specifies features of a debt offering, such as the  maturity date , the timing of interest or coupon payments, the method of interest calculation, and other features. Corporations and governments can issue debentures.
 
 
  Governments typically issue long-term bonds—those with maturities of longer than 10 years. Considered low-risk investments, these government bonds have the backing of the government issuer.
 
 
  Corporations also use debentures as long-term loans. However, the debentures of corporations are unsecured. Instead, they have the backing of only the financial viability and creditworthiness of the underlying company.
 
 
 
 
  These debt instruments pay an interest rate and are redeemable or repayable on a fixed date. A company typically makes these scheduled debt interest payments before they pay stock dividends to shareholders.
 
 
  Debentures are advantageous for companies since they carry lower interest rates and longer repayment dates as compared to other types of loans and debt instruments.
 
 
    Types of Debentures    
    Registered vs. Bearer    
  When debts are issued as debentures, they may be registered to the issuer. In this case, the transfer or trading in these securities must be organized through a clearing facility that alerts the issuer to changes in ownership so that they can pay interest to the correct bondholder.
 
 
  A  bearer debenture , in contrast, is not registered with the issuer. The owner (bearer) of the debenture is entitled to interest simply by holding the bond.
 
 
    Redeemable vs. Irredeemable    
  Redeemable debentures clearly spell out the exact terms and date by which the issuer of the bond must repay their debt in full. Irredeemable (non-redeemable) debentures, on the other hand, do not hold the issuer liable to repay in full by a certain date. Because of this, irredeemable debentures are also known as perpetual debentures. 
 
 
    Convertible vs. Nonconvertible    
   Convertible debentures  are bonds that can convert into equity shares of the issuing corporation after a specific period. Convertible debentures are hybrid financial products with the benefits of both debt and equity.
 
 
  Companies use debentures as fixed-rate loans and pay fixed interest payments. However, the holders of the debenture have the option of holding the loan until maturity and receiving the interest payments or convert","0 seconds of 1 minute, 23 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debenture.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"Klinger Oscillator: What it is, Formulas, Calculations","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Klinger Oscillator?    
  The Klinger oscillator was developed by Stephen Klinger to determine the long-term trend of  money flow  while remaining sensitive enough to detect short-term fluctuations. The indicator compares the  volume  flowing through securities with the security's price movements and then converts the result into an  oscillator . The Klinger oscillator shows the difference between two moving averages which are based on more than price. Traders watch for  divergence  on the indicator to signal potential price reversals. Like other oscillators, a  signal line  can be added to provide additional trade signals.
 
 
  Traders will use tools such as  trendlines , moving averages, and other indicators to confirm trade signals. In addition, traders may use the oscillator in conjunction with chart patterns, such as  price channels  or  triangles , as a way to confirm a breakout or breakdown. Crossovers occur frequently, as do divergences, so the indicator is best used in conjunction with these other technical trading methods.
 
 
    Formula for the Klinger Oscillator    
   K O = 3 4  Period  E M A  of  V F − 5 5  Period EMA of  V F where: KO =  Klinger Oscillator VF =  Volume Force Volume Force  = V × [ 2 × ( ( d m / c m ) − 1 ) ] × T × 1 0 0 V =  Volume T =  Trend Trend = + 1  if  ( H + L + C ) > ( H − 1 + L − 1 + C v − 1 ) Trend = − 1  if Above is  <  or  = H =  High L =  Low C =  Close d m = H − L c m = c m − 1 + d m  if Trend  =  Trend − 1 c m = d m − 1 + d m  if Trend  = / =  Trend − 1 \begin{aligned} &KO = 34 \text{ Period }EMA\text{ of }VF - 55\text{ Period EMA of }VF\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{KO} =\text{ Klinger Oscillator}\\ &\text{VF} =\text{ Volume Force}\\ &\text{Volume Force }= V \times [2 \times ((dm/cm) - 1)] \times T \times 100\\ &V =\text{ Volume}\\ &T =\text{ Trend}\\ & \text{Trend} =+1\text{ if }(H + L + C) > (H_{-1} + L_{-1} + Cv_{-1})\\ &\text{Trend} =-1 \text{ if Above is }<\text{ or }=\\ &H =\text{ High}\\ &L =\text{ Low}\\ &C =\text{ Close}\\ &dm = H-L\\ &cm =cm_{-1} +dm\text{ if Trend }=\text{ Trend}_{-1}\\ &cm = dm_{-1} + dm\text{ if Trend }=/= \text{ Trend}_{-1} \end{aligned} ​ K O = 3 4  Period  E M A  of  V F − 5 5  Period EMA of  V F where: KO =  Klinger Oscillator VF =  Volume Force Volume Force  = V × [ 2 × ( ( d m / c m ) − 1 ) ] × T × 1 0 0 V =  Volume T =  Trend Trend = + 1  if  ( H + L + C ) > ( H − 1 ​ + L − 1 ​ + C v − 1 ​ ) Trend = − 1  if Above is  <  or  = H =  High L =  Low C =  Close d m = H − L c m = c m − 1 ​ + d m  if Trend  =  Trend − 1 ​ c m = d m − 1 ​ + d m  if Trend  = / =  Trend − 1 ​ ​ ﻿
 
 
    Calculating the Klinger Oscillator    
   Note volume for the period, as well as the high, low and close prices. Compare this to the prior period to determine if Trend is positive to negative. Calculate dm using the current period's high and low. Calculate cm using dm and the prior cm value. For the first calculation use dm in place of the prior cm value if necessary. Calculate for volume force (VF). Calculate the 34- and 55-period EMAs of VF. Klinger used the following formula for the EMA: 
 
 
 
 
   E M A = ( C × A ) + ( E × B ) where: C =  Current period’s VF A =   2 / ( X + 1 ) , where  X  is the moving average  period (34 or 55) E = Prior period’s  E M A B = 1 − A \begin{aligned} &EMA = (C \times A) + (E \times B)\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &C=\text{ Current period's VF}\\ &\begin{aligned} A =\ &2/(X+1)\text{, where }X\text{ is the moving average}\\ &\text{ period (34 or 55)}\end{aligned}\\ &E = \text{Prior period's }EMA\\ &B=1-A \end{aligned} ​ E M A = ( C × A ) + ( E × B ) where: C =  Current period’s VF A =   ​ 2 / ( X + 1 ) , where  X  is the moving average  period (34 or 55) ​ E = Prior period’s  E M A B = 1 − A ​ ﻿
 
 
    Interpretations for Price Direction    
  The Klinger Oscillator is fairly complex to calculate, but it's based on the idea of  force volume , which accounts for volume,  trend  (positive or negative), and  temp  (based on multiple inputs and if/then statements). Using this data, the oscillator is created by looking at the difference between two  exponential moving averages  of force volume involving different time frames (typically 34 and 55). The idea is to show how the volume flowing through the securities is impacting its long-term and short-term price direction.
 
 
    The Signal Line    
  A  signal line  (13-period moving average) is used to trigger buy or sell signals. This technique is very similar to signals that are created with other indicators such as the  moving average convergence divergence  (MACD). While these are the basic signals generated by these indicators, it's important to note that these techniques may generate a lot of trading signals that may not be as effective in  sideways markets .
 
 
    The Uptrend    
  When an asset is in an overall uptrend—such as when it is above its 100-period moving average and the Klinger is above zero or moving above zero—traders could buy w","By

   Key Takeaways 
 Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a type of financing for startup companies and small businesses with long-term growth potential. Venture capitalists provide backing through financing, technological expertise, or managerial experience. VC firms raise money from limited partners (LPs) to invest in promising startups or even larger venture funds. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Michela Buttignol 
 
    Understanding Venture Capital (VC)    
  VC provides  financing to startups and small companies  that investors believe have great growth potential. Financing typically comes in the form of  private equity (PE) . Ownership positions are sold to a few investors through independent  limited partnerships  (LPs). Venture capital tends to focus on emerging companies, while PE tends to fund established companies seeking an equity infusion. VC is an essential source for raising money, especially if start-ups lack access to  capital markets , bank loans, or other debt instruments. 1 
 
 
  Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot is generally considered the ""Father of Venture Capital."" He started the American Research and Development Corporation in 1946 and raised a $3.58 million fund to invest in companies that commercialized technologies developed during World War II. 2 3  The corporation's first investment was in a company that had ambitions to use X-ray technology for cancer treatment. The $200,000 that Doriot invested turned into $1.8 million when the company went public in 1955. 3 
 
 
  VC became synonymous with the growth of technology companies in Silicon Valley on the West Coast. By 1992, 48% of all investment dollars went into West Coast companies; Northeast Coast industries accounted for just 20%. 4  During 2022, West Coast companies accounted for more than 37% of all deals while the Mid-Atlantic region saw just around 24% of all deals. 5

"Yuppie: Definition, History, and Yuppies Today","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Yuppie?    
  Yuppie is a slang term denoting the  market segment  of young urban professionals. A yuppie is often characterized by youth, affluence, and business success. They are often preppy in appearance and like to show off their success by their style and possessions.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The term yuppie originated in the 1980s and is used to refer to young urban professionals who are successful in business and considerably affluent. Some credit writer Joseph Epstein with using the term while others point to journalist Dan Rottenberg's  Chicago  magazine article. It is difficult to identify modern yuppies because modern society has doled out wealth to various groups of people rather than a specific set of people with similar characteristics. 
 
    Understanding the Term Yuppie    
  Coined in the 1980s, the term yuppie was used as a derogatory title for young business people who were considered arrogant, undeservedly  wealthy , and obnoxious. Yuppies often wore high-fashion clothing, drove BMWs, and gloated about their successes. The term has become less of a stereotype and now promotes the image of an affluent professional.
 
 
  Yuppies tend to be educated with high-paying jobs, and they live in or near large cities. Some typical industries associated with yuppies include finance, tech, academia, and many areas in the arts, especially those associated with liberal thinking and style.
 
 
    History of the Term Yuppie    
  There is some debate over who first coined the term yuppie, but many attribute this to Joseph Epstein, writer and former editor of  The American Scholar . 1 
 
 
  Others credit journalist Dan Rottenberg with coining the term in 1980 in an article titled ""About That Urban Renaissance..."" for  Chicago  magazine. Rottenberg describes the  gentrification  of Chicago's downtown by upwardly mobile young professionals rebelling against suburbia. ""The Yuppies seek neither comfort nor security, but stimulation, and they can find that only in the densest sections of the city,"" he wrote. 2 
 
 
  Linguistically, the term was an evolution, starting from the word ""hippie,"" which 20 years earlier was a label attached to someone considered ""hip"" to the current culture. That word morphed into ""yippie""—counterculture advocates associated with the Youth International Party.
 
 
 
 
  At nearly the same time, a parody of an American stereotype of the ""country club/prep school culture"" called ""The Preppy Handbook"" made  The New York Times  bestseller list. ""Yuppie"" was the mash-up of all of these moments in the lives of young adults in America, each a reflection of their time.
 
 
  Yippies, in contrast to yuppies, were affiliates of the Youth International Party, a counterculture group that emerged in the late 1960s. The term continued to grow throughout the 1980s as it was used in more newspaper and magazine articles. 3 
 
 
  After the  1987 stock market crash , the term yuppie became less political and gained more of the social implications it has today. Although its usage declined in the 1990s, the term was still used in and around that decade.
 
 
  It has been used and cited in articles, songs, movies, and other pop culture media. To name a few, the term has appeared in the novel and film ""Fight Club,"" the movie ""American Psycho,"" the satirical blog ""Stuff White People Like"" and the Tom Petty song ""Yer So Bad."" The term has lost prevalence in the 21st century. 4 
 
 
  The term yuppie isn't confined only to the United States—other countries, such as China, Russia, and Mexico, have their variations of yuppies that generally also carry the hallmark connotation of young, higher-class professionals. The term tends to spread and thrive in  prospering economies .
 
 
    Modern Yuppies    
  In the 21st century, the term takes on new meaning while retaining the basic tenets of original yuppies. For example, due to the Internet and growing reliance on electronic communication, the term yuppie could refer to a  Silicon Valley  tech worker who doesn't necessarily have the same social skills as the original yuppie but still works for a prestigious company and makes a lot of money.
 
 
  This can make it harder to define yuppies since it might not be obvious at first glance that these people have glamorous careers. Perhaps, as a result, the term yuppie isn't used as widely as it was in the 1980s and early 1990s.
 
 
  A 2015 article in  The New York Times  made the case that the all-encompassing definition of yuppies had fragmented. Micro-yuppies abounded. These yuppies profess allegiance to lifestyles, such as nature-based, professional communities, technology executives, or even online communities, such as gaming. 5 
 
 
  Hipsters, who mock the consumption culture fostered by modern society, have replaced earlier yuppies. However, the irony of the situation is that they participate in society actively through their choices. 5

 Definition 
 The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) surmises that the average of the sample means and standard deviations equals the population mean and standard deviation. 
    What Is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?    
  The Central Limit Theorem is useful when analyzing large data sets because it assumes that the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed and typically form a  bell curve . The CLT may be used in conjunction with the  law of large numbers , which states that the average obtained from a large group of independent random samples converges to the true value.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 CLT assumes that a large sample size can successfully predict the characteristics of a population. Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient under the Central Limit Theorem. Investors may use CLT to study a random sample of stocks to estimate returns for a portfolio. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou 
 
    Understanding the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)    
  According to the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample of data will be closer to the mean of the overall population in question as the sample size increases, notwithstanding the actual distribution of the data. The concept can hold true regardless of whether the distribution of the population is normal or skewed. 1 
 
 
  As a general rule, sample sizes of 30 or more are typically deemed sufficient for the CLT to hold, meaning that the distribution of the sample means is fairly normally distributed. In addition, the more samples one takes, the more the graphed results should take the shape of a normal distribution. 1 
 
 
  The central limit theorem is often used in conjunction with the law of large numbers, which states that the average of the sample means will come closer to equaling the population mean as the sample size grows. This concept can be extremely useful in accurately predicting the characteristics of very large populations.
 
 
 
 
  Although this concept was first developed by Abraham de Moivre in 1733, it was not formalized until 1920, when the Hungarian mathematician George Pólya dubbed it the central limit theorem. 2 3

    Key Components of the Central Limit Theorem    
  The central limit theorem has several key components. They largely revolve around sampling technique.
 
 
   Sampling is successive :   This means some sample units are common with sample units selected on previous occasions. Sampling is random :   All samples must be selected at random so that they have the same statistical possibility of being selected. Samples should be independent : The selections or results from one sample should have no bearing on future samples or other sample results. Large sample size : As sample size increases, the sampling distribution should come ever closer to the normal distribution. 4 5 
 
 
    The Central Limit Theorem in Finance and Investing    
  The CLT can help examine the returns of an individual stock or broader stock indices because the analysis is simple, due to the relative ease of generating the necessary financial data. Consequently, investors often rely on the CLT to analyze stock returns, construct portfolios, and manage risk.

"Zero-Lot-Line House: Definition, Advantages, Drawbacks and Types","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Zero-Lot-Line House?    
  A zero-lot-line house is a piece of residential  real estate  in which the structure comes up to, or very near to, the edge of the property line. Rowhouses, garden homes, patio homes, and townhomes are all types of properties that may be zero-lot-line homes. They may be attached (as in a townhouse) or a detached single story or multistory residence.
 
 
   key takeaways 
 A zero-lot-line house is a piece of residential real estate in which the structure comes up to, or very near to, the edge of the property line. Zero-lot-line houses can be attached or detached, and are especially popular in urban areas. Noise and proximity to neighbors can be disadvantages to zero-lot-line homes. Low maintenance and lower prices are advantages of zero-lot-line homes. 
 
    Understanding a Zero-Lot-Line House    
  Zero-lot-line houses are built very close to their boundary lines to create more usable space for the residence. Because there is virtually no space left over they are called ""zero lot."" With a zero-lot-line house, the buyer only has to pay for a lot large enough to hold the house. Such a home confers savings to purchasers who cannot afford a larger lot or do not feel they need one enough to justify the expense.
 
 
  These homes are especially popular in urban renewal settings. In places with high population density, such as the urban core of a large metropolitan area, zero-lot-line houses impart buyers with options beyond the typical lofts and condos while maintaining the ability to provide housing for large numbers of people in a tightly circumscribed area.
 
 
    Zero-Lot-Line House Advantages    
  Though they cost less than homes with lots of extra acreage, zero-lot-line homes are not just for low-income homebuyers; they are an attractive option for anyone who doesn't have the time or inclination to maintain landscaping. Not leaving room in the property plot for a yard allows for maximum square footage in the home. Zero-lot homes offer many of the advantages of actual houses—without the time-consuming demands of upkeep and the expense of large backyards or front lawns.
 
 
  These homes are also an appealing alternative to  condos  because they offer greater privacy and independence while still being low-maintenance. A common complaint in condominium settings is that a homeowner shares walls with as many as five neighbors, increasing the chances of noise disturbances from neighbors and eroding any sense of privacy. While certain zero-lot-line homes, such as townhouses and rowhouses, still include shared walls, there are fewer of them. Other zero-lot-line options, such as garden homes, offer homeowners the freedom of a standalone structure.
 
 
 
 
  Because zero lot developments often incorporate shared spaces into their design—features such as shared back alleys and front porches right at the street—many of these home encourage a real sense of community among neighbors.
 
 
    Zero-Lot-Line House Disadvantages    
  Window placement, noise, and a lack of privacy can be issues with these types of homes since there is little to no buffer zone surrounding them. Moreover, because zero-lot-line homes typically feature less setback from the road compared to homes on larger lots, noise from passing cars may be of constant concern, particularly if the home is situated on a busy thoroughfare.
 
 
  Zero-lot-line houses can create challenges among neighbors, especially in areas where people are used to having larger buffer zones. In traditionally dense neighborhoods where residents are used to living in close quarters, smaller buffer zones are less of a challenge.
 
 
  Finally, zero-lot-line homes might fetch less on the real estate market, especially in boom times. Lots of land around a home still connote luxury and value, and provide homeowners with flexibility to expand. To some, a zero-lot-line home could represent the worst of all worlds: all the noise and lack of privacy of an apartment, with the upkeep of a free-standing structure, but without compensatory acreage and space.

"Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes (KOSPI): Meaning, History","Close 
 
 
 
    What are the Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes?    
  Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes (KOSPI) refers to a series of indexes that track the overall Korean Stock Exchange and its components. Each of the KOSPI indexes are  capitalization-weighted  market averages. 
 
 
  The best-known of these indexes is the KOSPI 200, which comprises the 200 largest publicly-traded common stocks traded in Korea, tracking roughly 70% of the market value of the overall Korean Stock Exchange. 1 ﻿ The KOSPI 200 is used as a rough benchmark when investors or traders refer to the performance of the Korean Exchange. For this reason, and because its components are  large-cap stocks , people compare the KOSPI 200 to the S&P 500 in the United States.
 
 
  As of 2021, major KOSPI 200 components included consumer product maker Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, semiconductor manufacturer SK Hynix, utility provider Korea Electric Power, and Shinhan Bank. 2 ﻿
 
 
    Understanding the Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes    
  The Korean Composite Stock Price Indexes (KOSPI) first debuted in the early 1980s, with several variants rolled out in subsequent years, including the KOSPI 100 which focused on mid-caps, and the KOSPI 50 which represents small caps. The KOSPI also refers to a family of indices tracking specific industries including chemicals and banks, and the KODI index, which specializes in  dividend  stocks. Also, the KOSPI appears on several other products that track the prices of futures, options, and sovereign bonds.
 
 
  Note that while KOSPI refers to the entire family of indexes, many market participants call the KOSPI 200 simply the KOSPI.
 
 
    History of the KOSPI 200    
  The KOSPI 200 began trading at the start of January in 1983 at a value of 122.52. 1 ﻿ Its base value, indexed to January 4, 1980, is 100. The KOSPI 200 rose more than 8-fold to a value of more than 1,000 by April of 1989, roughly two years following the Asian financial crisis. The index value surged to 1,997.06 by its 30th birthday at the end of 2012, trailing only the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Taiwan Stock Exchange over the same time frame. The KOSPI 200 index stood at roughly 2,470 by mid-2018, up more than 20-fold since its introduction. 3 ﻿
 
 
  Notable dates for the KOSPI include June 17, 1988, when it gained about 8.5%, its largest one-day percentage gain. It also fell more than 12% on September 12, 2001, the day following the  9/11 terrorist attack  in the U.S. The index closed above 2,000 for the first time on July 24, 2007. 3 ﻿
 
 
 
 
  Analysts, market participants, and the international financial news media all follow the KOSPI 200 to varying degrees. U.S.-based news outlets such as The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, as well as London-based Reuters, owned by Canada-based Thomson Reuters, often quote the index and use its values when reporting on market events in Korea.

"Labor Union: Definition, History, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Labor Union?    
  A labor union is an organization of workers in a trade, industry, or company that is created to represent the workers in negotiations with management over issues of pay, benefits, and working conditions. The labor union representatives negotiate with employers in a process known as  collective bargaining . The process results in a tentative agreement that requires a vote of the full membership to be finalized.
 
 
  Unions have a long  history in the United States . The first union was established by Philadelphia shoemakers in 1794. The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions was formed in 1881, followed five years later by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A labor union represents the collective interests of workers, bargaining with employers over wages and working conditions. Modern labor unions have local chapters which operate under charters from a national organization. U.S. law requires an employer to actively bargain with a union in good faith. The employer is not required to agree to any specific terms. 
 
    How a Labor Union Works    
   Labor unions  generally have a democratic structure, holding elections to choose officers to make decisions that are beneficial to the members. Employees pay dues to the union. In return, the labor union acts as an advocate on the employees’ behalf.
 
 
  Labor unions are often industry-specific and tend to be most common today among public sector (government) employees and those in transportation and utilities. 3 4 
 
 
  To form a union, a locally based group of employees obtains a charter from a national-level labor organization. Two large organizations oversee most of the labor unions in the U.S.—the Change to Win Federation (CtW) and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The AFL-CIO was formed in 1955 after the two groups merged. The CtW spun off from the AFL-CIO in 2005. 5 6 2 
 
 
  Nearly  all unions  are structured and work in similar ways. U.S. law requires an employer to actively bargain with a union in good faith; however, the employer is not required to agree to any specific terms. Multiple negotiation rounds are conducted between the union’s bargaining unit—a group of members whose duty is to assure that its members are properly compensated and represented—and the employer.
 
 
 
 
  A collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is eventually agreed upon and signed. The CBA outlines pay scales and includes other terms of employment, such as vacation and sick days, benefits, working hours, and working conditions. 7 
 
 
  After signing the CBA, an employer cannot change the agreement without a union representative’s approval; however, CBAs eventually expire, at which time the labor union and management must negotiate and sign a new agreement. 8 
 
 
   Important 
 Despite being a boon to workers, labor unions have seen membership decrease significantly since their heyday in the mid-20th century. 9 
 
 
 
    Example of a Labor Union    
  The  National Education Association  (NEA) represents teachers and other education professionals and is the largest labor union in the United States, with nearly 3 million members. 10 
 
 
  It represents public school teachers, substitute teachers, higher education faculty members, education support workers, administrators, retired teachers, and students working to become teachers.
 
 
  The NEA works with local and state educational systems to set adequate wages and working conditions for its members, among other activities. 11 
 
 
    History of Labor Unions    
  Labor unions have played a critical role in the workforce of the United States. In the industrial space,  labor unions fought  for safer conditions, better working hours, and better pay. Labor unions also worked to stop child labor.
 
 
  The history of labor unions in the U.S. pre-date the country; the first strike occurred in 1768 when New York journeyman tailors protested against a wage reduction. As a result, the Federal Society of Journeyman Cordwainers was created in 1794 in Philadelphia, and is considered to be the beginning of trade union organization. 12 
 
 
  Refusal to admit Black people, women, and immigrant groups were common in labor unions in the 19th and early 20th century, and excluded groups formed their own unions. Today, labor union membership is very diverse, including more women and Black and Latino/Latina workers than ever before, though Asian workers are underrepresented. 13 14 
 
 
  The right to form unions was established in 1935 by the National Labor Relations Act, also known as the Wagner Act. It gave unionized employees the right to strike and bargain jointly for working conditions. The act encouraged collective bargaining, stopped unfair tactics by employers, and set up enforcement in a new independent agency, the National Labor Relations Board. 15

 Definition 
 Gross national product (GNP) is the value of products and services produced by the citizens of a country both domestically and internationally but not including income earned by foreign residents. 
    What Is Gross National Product (GNP)?    
  Gross national product (GNP) is an economic measure that's commonly calculated by taking the sum of personal consumption expenditures, private domestic investment, government expenditure, net exports, and any income earned by residents from overseas investments, then subtracting income earned by foreign residents. Net exports represent the difference between what a country exports minus any imports of goods and services.
 
 
  GNP is related to another important economic measure called  gross domestic product  (GDP), which takes into account all output produced within a country's borders regardless of who owns the means of production. GNP starts with GDP, adds residents'  investment income  from overseas investments, and subtracts foreign residents' investment income earned within a country.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 GNP measures the output of a country's residents regardless of the location of the actual underlying economic activity. Income from overseas investments by a country's residents counts in GNP but foreign investment within a country's borders does not. This is in contrast to GDP which measures economic output and income based on location rather than nationality. GNP and GDP can have different values.  A large difference between a country's GNP and GDP can suggest a great deal of integration into the global economy. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Eliana Rodgers 
 
    How Gross National Product (GNP) Works    
  GNP measures the total monetary value of the output produced by a country's residents. Therefore, any output produced by foreign residents within the country's borders must be excluded in calculations of GNP, while any output produced by the country's residents outside of its borders must be counted.
 
 
  GNP does not include intermediate goods and services to avoid double-counting since they are already incorporated in the  value of final goods and services .
 
 
 
 
  The U.S. used GNP until 1991 as its main measure of economic activity. After that point, it started to use GDP in its place for two main reasons. 1

  First, GDP corresponds more closely to other U.S. economic data of interest to policymakers, such as employment and industrial production, which, like GDP, measure activity within the boundaries of the U.S. and ignore nationalities. Second, the switch to GDP was to facilitate cross-country comparisons because most other countries at the time primarily used GDP. 1 
 
 
    GNP vs. GDP    
  GNP and GDP are very closely related concepts, and the main differences between them come from the fact that there may be companies owned by foreign residents that produce goods in the country, and companies owned by domestic residents that produce goods for the rest of the world and revert  earned income  to domestic residents.
 
 
  For example, there are a number of foreign companies that produce goods and services in the United States and transfer any income earned to their foreign residents.

"What Is a Loan, How Does It Work, Types, and Tips on Getting One","Definition 
 A loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in exchange for future repayment of the principal amount, generally with interest. 
    What Is a Loan?    
  A loan is a form of credit where a specific amount of money is given to someone with the agreement that it will be paid back later. In many cases, the lender also adds interest or finance charges to the principal value, which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance.
 
 
  Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an  open-ended line of credit  up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms, including secured, unsecured, commercial, and personal loans.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A loan is when money is given to another party in exchange for repayment of the loan principal amount plus interest. Lenders will consider a prospective borrower's income, credit score, and debt levels before deciding to offer them a loan. A loan may be secured by collateral, such as a mortgage, or it may be unsecured, such as a credit card. Revolving loans or lines can be spent, repaid, and spent again, while term loans are fixed-rate, fixed-payment loans. Lenders may charge higher interest rates to risky borrowers. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    Understanding Loans    
  A loan is a form of  debt  incurred by an individual or other entity. The lender—usually a corporation, financial institution, or government—advances a sum of money to the borrower. In return, the borrower agrees to a certain set of terms, including any  finance charges , interest, repayment date, and other conditions.
 
 
  In some cases, the lender may require  collateral  to secure the loan and ensure repayment. Loans may also take the form of bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs). It is also possible to take a loan from a  401(k)  account.
 
 
 
 
    The Loan Process    
  Here's how the loan process works: When someone needs money, they apply for a loan from a bank, corporation, government, or other entity. The borrower may be required to provide specific details such as the reason for the loan, their financial history,  Social Security number  (SSN), and other information. The lender reviews this information as well as a person's  debt-to-income  (DTI) ratio, to determine if the loan can be paid back. 1 
 
 
  Based on the applicant's  creditworthiness , the lender either denies or approves the application. The lender must provide a reason should the loan application be denied. If the application is approved, both parties sign a contract that outlines the details of the agreement. The lender advances the proceeds of the loan, after which the borrower must repay the amount, including any additional charges, such as interest.
 
 
  The terms of a loan are agreed to by each party before any money or property changes hands or is  disbursed . If the lender requires collateral, the lender outlines this in the loan documents. Most loans also have provisions regarding the maximum amount of interest, in addition to other  covenants , such as the length of time before repayment is required.
 
 
    Why Are Loans Used?    
  Loans are advanced for a number of reasons, including major purchases, investing, renovations, debt consolidation, and business ventures. Loans also help  existing companies expand their operations . Loans allow for growth in the overall  money supply  in an economy and open up competition by lending to new businesses.
 
 
  The interest and fees from loans are a primary source of revenue for many banks, as well as some retailers through the use of  credit facilities  and credit cards.
 
 
    Components of a Loan    
  There are several important terms that determine the size of a loan and how quickly the borrower can pay it back:
 
 
 
 Principal:  This is the original amount of money that is being borrowed. 
 Loan term:  The amount of time that the borrower has to repay the loan. 
 Interest rate:  The rate at which the amount of money owed increases, usually expressed in terms of an  annual percentage rate  (APR). 
 Loan payments:  The amount of money that must be paid every month or week in order to satisfy the terms of the loan. Based on the principal, loan term, and interest rate, this can be determined from an amortization table. 
 
 
  In addition, the lender may also tack on additional fees, such as an  origination fee , a  servicing fee , or  late payment fees . For larger loans, they may also require collateral, such as real estate or a vehicle. If the borrower defaults on the loan, these assets may be seized to pay off the remaining debt. 2 
 
 
    Tips on Getting a Loan    
  In order to qualify for a loan, prospective borrowers need to show that they have the ability and financial discipline to repay the lender. There are several factors that lenders consider when deciding if a particular borrower is worth the risk:

"Know Sure Thing (KST) Definition, Calculation, Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Know Sure Thing (KST)?    
  The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum  oscillator  developed by Martin Pring to make rate-of-change readings easier for traders to interpret.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator intended to interpret rate-of-change price data. Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders also look for overbought or oversold conditions. Traders also combine the KST with other technical analysis to maximize their odds of a successful trade. 
 
    Calculating the Know Sure Thing (KST)    
  The KST is calculated by taking the  simple moving average  (SMA) of four different  rate-of-change  (ROC) periods, adding them together to come up with the KST, and creating a signal line by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST.
 
 
  The KST is calculated with the following equation:
 
 
   KST = ( RCMA #1 × 1 ) + ( RCMA #2 × 2 )   + KST = ( RCMA #3 × 3 ) + ( RCMA #4 × 4 ) where: RCMA #1 = 10-period SMA of 10-period ROC RCMA #2 = 10-period SMA of 15-period ROC RCMA #3 = 10-period SMA of 20-period ROC RCMA #4 = 15-period SMA of 30-period ROC \begin{aligned} &\text{KST} = ( \text{RCMA \#1} \times 1 ) + ( \text{RCMA \#2} \times 2 ) \ + \\ &\phantom { \text{KST} = } (\text{RCMA \#3} \times 3 ) + ( \text{RCMA \#4} \times 4) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{RCMA \#1} = \text{10-period SMA of 10-period ROC} \\ &\text{RCMA \#2} = \text{10-period SMA of 15-period ROC} \\ &\text{RCMA \#3} = \text{10-period SMA of 20-period ROC} \\ &\text{RCMA \#4} = \text{15-period SMA of 30-period ROC} \\ \end{aligned} ​ KST = ( RCMA #1 × 1 ) + ( RCMA #2 × 2 )   + KST = ( RCMA #3 × 3 ) + ( RCMA #4 × 4 ) where: RCMA #1 = 10-period SMA of 10-period ROC RCMA #2 = 10-period SMA of 15-period ROC RCMA #3 = 10-period SMA of 20-period ROC RCMA #4 = 15-period SMA of 30-period ROC ​ 
 
 
  Finally, the  signal line  is calculated by taking the 9-period SMA of the KST value.
 
 
    Understanding the Know Sure Thing (KST)    
  The KST indicator can be used in the same manner as many  other momentum oscillators , such as the well-known  relative strength index  (RSI). Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders may also look for convergence and divergence with the price, overbought or oversold conditions, or  crossovers  of the center line.
 
 
  Many traders combine the KST indicator with other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of success. For example, traders may look at other non-momentum indicators, chart patterns, or  candlestick  patterns to help in their decision-making.
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 In a 1992  Stocks and Commodities  article, Pring referred to the indicator as ""Summed Rate of Change (KST),"" but the KST term stuck with  technical analysts . 1 
 
 
 
    Example of the Know Sure Thing (KST)    
  Let's take a look at an example chart:
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021 
 
  In the example above, the KST indicator reached highly overbought conditions in early February and eventually experienced a crossover, which generated a well-timed  sell signal . The indicator also crossed over in late February, mid-March, and mid-April with limited success, but the key is looking for both  overbought  or  oversold  conditions, as well as a crossover to signal the trade.
 
 
  Traders may have also looked at other forms of  technical analysis  to maximize their odds of a successful trade. For example, traders looking at the above chart may have considered the significant bearish  volume  on the day that the signal occurred or the candlestick patterns leading up to the trading signal when making their decision. These insights could also be used to avoid making less profitable trades suggested by the KST indicator.

    What Is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)?    
  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures. The  FDIC was created  in 1933 to maintain public confidence and encourage stability in the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices. 1 
 
 
  As of 2023, the FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor as long as the institution is a member firm. It is  critical for consumers to confirm  whether their institution is FDIC-insured. 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures.  The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, as long as the institution is a member firm. The FDIC covers checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts, IRAs, revocable and irrevocable trust accounts, and employee benefit plans. 3 Mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies, stocks, and bonds aren't covered by the FDIC. 2 
 
  The primary purpose of the FDIC is to prevent ""run-on-the-bank"" scenarios, which devastated many banks during the  Great Depression . For example, with the threat of the closure of a bank, small groups of worried customers rushed to withdraw their money in those years.
 
 
  After fears spread, a stampede of customers, seeking to do the same, ultimately resulted in banks being unable to support withdrawal requests. Those who were first to withdraw their money from a troubled bank would benefit, whereas those who waited risked losing their savings overnight. Before the FDIC, there was no guarantee for the safety of  deposits  beyond the confidence in the bank's stability.
 
 
    Understanding the FDIC    
  Because practically all banks and thrifts now offer FDIC coverage, many consumers face less uncertainty regarding their deposits. As a result, banks have a better opportunity to address problems under controlled circumstances without triggering a run on the bank.

  In case of  bank failure , the FDIC covers deposits up to $250,000, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category such as  retirement accounts  and trusts. This sum is adequate for the majority of depositors, though depositors with more than that sum should  spread their assets among multiple banks .
 
 
 
 
    Example 1:    
  If you have $200,000 in a savings account and $100,000 in a  certificate of deposit (CD) , you have $50,000 uninsured.
 
 
    Example 2:    
  If a couple has $500,000 in a joint account, as well as $250,000 in an eligible retirement account, the entire $750,000 would be covered by the FDIC, as each co-owner's share in the joint account is covered, and the retirement account is a different account category.

"51% Attack: Definition, Who Is At Risk, Example, and Cost","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a 51% Attack?    
  A 51% attack is an attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by an entity or group that controls more than 50% of the network. If a party were to gain this much control of a network, it would have the power to alter the blockchain.
 
 
  The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse non-confirmed transactions that were completed while they were in control. Reversing transactions could allow them to double-spend coins, one of the issues mechanisms like proof-of-work were created to prevent.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Blockchains are distributed ledgers that record every transaction made on a cryptocurrency's network. A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain by an entity or group that controls more than 50% of the network. Attackers with majority network control can interrupt the recording of new blocks by preventing other miners from completing blocks. Changing historical blocks is impossible due to the chain of information stored in Bitcoin's blockchain. Although a successful attack on Bitcoin or Ethereum is unlikely, smaller networks are frequent targets for 51% attacks. 
 
    Understanding a 51% Attack    
  A  blockchain  is a distributed ledger—essentially a database—that records transactions and information about them. The blockchain's network reaches a majority consensus about transactions through a validation process. The blocks where the data is stored are sealed. The blocks are linked together via cryptographic techniques where previous block information is recorded in each block. This makes the blocks nearly impossible to alter once they are confirmed enough times.
 
 
  The 51% attack is an attack on the blockchain, where a group controls more than 50% of the hashing power—the computing that solves the cryptographic puzzle—of the network. This group then introduces an altered blockchain to the network at a very specific point in the blockchain, which is theoretically accepted by the network because the attackers would own most of it. 1 
 
 
  Changing historical blocks—transactions locked in before the start of the attack—would be extremely difficult even in the event of a 51% attack. The further back the transactions are, the more difficult it is to change them. It would be impossible to change transactions before a checkpoint, where transactions become permanent in Bitcoin's blockchain.
 
 
 
 
    Attacks Are Prohibitively Expensive    
  A 51% attack is a very difficult and challenging task on a blockchain network with a large participation rate. In most cases, the group of attackers would need to be able to control the necessary 51% and have created an alternate blockchain that can be inserted at exactly the right moment. Then, they would need to out-hash the main network. The cost of doing this is one of the most significant factors that prevent a 51% attack.
 
 
  For example, one of the most advanced application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners is the WhatsMiner M63S. It costs more than $10,000 (new) and has a  hash  rate of 406 terahashes per second (TH/s). 2  A single or smaller group of miners would not be able to alter and mine the Bitcoin blockchain with only a few of these machines. It would take thousands of these ASICs to get ahead of the Bitcoin network. Smaller networks could be out-hashed using these mining rigs, but the benefits of doing so wouldn't outweigh the costs of funding the attack and setting it up.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Hashing power rental services provide attackers with lower costs, as they only need to rent as much hashing power as they need for the duration of the attack. 3 
 
 
 
  After Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake, a 51% attack on the Ethereum blockchain became even more expensive. To conduct this attack, a user or group would need to own 51% of the staked ETH on the network. It is possible for someone to own that much ETH, but it's unlikely.
 
 
  According to Beaconchain, more than 32.3 million ETH were staked on May 8, 2024. 4  An entity would need to own and stake more than 16.5 million ETH (more than $49 billion as of May 8, 2024) to attempt an attack. 5 
 
 
  Once the attack started, the consensus mechanism would likely recognize it and immediately slash the staked ETH, costing the attacker an extraordinary amount of money. Additionally, the community can vote to restore the ""honest"" chain, so an attacker would lose all of their ETH just to see the damage repaired. 6 
 
 
    Attack Timing    
  In addition to the costs, a group attempting to attack the network using a 51% attack must not only control 51% of the network but also introduce the altered blockchain at a very precise time. Even if they own 51% of the network hashing rate, they still might not be able to keep up with the block creation rate or get their chain inserted before valid new blocks are created by th","By

 Definition 
 Solvency ratios are commonly used to determine a firm's ability to remain solvent.   
    What Is a Solvency Ratio?    
  A solvency ratio is a measurement of a firm's financial health. It indicates whether a company’s cash flow is sufficient to meet its  long-term liabilities . An unfavorable ratio can indicate some likelihood that a company will default on its debt obligations. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A solvency ratio examines a firm's ability to meet its long-term debts and obligations. The main solvency ratios include the debt-to-assets ratio, the interest coverage ratio, the equity ratio, and the debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. Solvency ratios are often used by prospective lenders when evaluating a company's creditworthiness, as well as by potential bond investors. Solvency ratios and liquidity ratios both measure a company's financial health, but solvency ratios have a longer-term outlook than liquidity ratios. Like other financial ratios, solvency ratios often hold the most value when compared over time or against other companies. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Laura Porter 
 
    How Solvency Ratios Work    
  A solvency ratio is one of many metrics used to determine whether a company can stay solvent in the long term. A solvency ratio is a comprehensive measure of solvency, as it measures a firm's actual cash flow, rather than net income, by adding back  depreciation  and other non-cash expenses to assess a company’s capacity to stay afloat.
 
 
  It measures this cash flow capacity versus all liabilities rather than only  short-term debt . This way, a solvency ratio assesses a company's long-term health by evaluating its repayment ability for its long-term debt and the interest on that debt.
 
 
  Solvency ratios vary from industry to industry. A company’s solvency ratio should, therefore, be compared with its competitors in the same industry rather than viewed in isolation.
 
 
 
 
  A solvency ratio terminology is also used when evaluating insurance companies, comparing the size of their capital relative to the premiums written, and measuring the risk an insurer faces on claims it cannot cover.

   Important 
 The main solvency ratios are the debt-to-assets ratio, the interest coverage ratio, the equity ratio, and the debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. These measures may be compared with  liquidity ratios , which consider a firm's ability to meet short-term obligations rather than medium- to long-term ones. 
 
 
 
    Types of Solvency Ratios    
    Interest coverage ratio    
  The  interest coverage ratio  is calculated as follows: 
 Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT Interest Expenses \text{Interest Coverage Ratio}=\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expenses}} Interest Coverage Ratio = Interest Expenses EBIT ​ 
 where: 
 
 EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxes 
 
 The interest coverage ratio measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payments with its available earnings. In other words, it measures the margin of safety a company has for paying interest on its debt during a given period. 
 The higher the ratio, the better. If the ratio falls to 1.5 or below, it may indicate that a company will have difficulty meeting the interest on its debts.

Hedge: Definition and How It Works in Investing,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A hedge is an investing strategy that aims to reduce risk by taking an opposite position in a related asset. 
    What Is a Hedge?    
  Hedging is a strategy to limit investment risks. Investors hedge an investment by trading in another that is likely to move in the opposite direction. A  risk-reward tradeoff  is inherent in hedging; while it reduces potential risk, it may chip away at potential gains.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Hedging typically involves trading in derivatives, which can be effective because their relationship with their underlying assets is clearly defined. Portfolio diversification is a type of hedge, such as when investors buy cyclical and countercyclical stocks. Large financial entities and investment funds tend to engage in hedging practices. 
 
    How a Hedge Works    
  Using a hedge is a bit like taking out an insurance policy. If you own a home in a flood-prone area, you can protect it from the risk of flooding—hedge it, in other words—by taking out flood insurance. You cannot eliminate the risk of a flood, but you can mitigate the financial losses you could incur.
 
 
  Similarly, if you invest in a hot technology company with the firm belief that its business will thrive over the next quarters, you might also invest in a solid consumer staple stock just in case you're mistaken.
 
 
    The Downside to a Hedge    
  Hedging isn’t free. In the case of the flood insurance policy example, the monthly payments add up, and if the flood never comes, the policyholder gets nothing. Still, most people would choose to limit their losses.
 
 
  In the world of professional investing, hedging works in the same way. Investors and money managers use hedging practices to reduce and control their  risk exposure . They use various tools for the purpose, many based on derivatives.

   Fast Fact 
 A  perfect hedge  eliminates all risk in a position or portfolio. In other words, the hedge is 100% inversely correlated to the vulnerable asset. This is more an ideal than a reality, and even the hypothetical perfect hedge is not without cost. 
 
 
 
    Hedging With Derivatives    
  Derivatives are financial contracts whose price depends on the value of an underlying security. Futures, forwards, and options contracts are common types of derivative contracts.
 
 
  The effectiveness of a derivative hedge is expressed in terms of its  delta , sometimes called the hedge ratio. Delta is the amount that the price of a derivative moves per $1 movement in the price of the underlying asset.
 
 
  The specific hedging strategy, as well as the pricing of hedging instruments, depends largely upon the downside risk of the underlying security against which the investor wants to hedge. Generally, the greater the downside risk, the greater the cost of the hedge.
 
 
  Downside risk tends to increase with higher levels of volatility and over time; an option that expires after a longer period, which is linked to a volatile security, will be more expensive as a means of hedging. 
 
 
  In general, the higher the strike price, the more expensive the put option will be, but the more price protection it will offer as well. These variables can be adjusted to create a less expensive option that offers less protection, or a more expensive one that provides greater protection.
 
 
    Example of Hedging With a Put Option    
  A common method for hedging is through put options.   Puts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a pre-set price on or before the date it expires.
 
 
  For example, if Morty buys 100 shares of PLC stock at $10 per share, and hedges the investment by purchasing a  put option  with a  strike price  of $8 expiring in one year. This option gives Morty the right to sell 100 shares of that stock for $8 per share anytime in the next year.
 
 
  Let’s assume Morty pays $1 for the option, or $100 in premium. If the stock trades at $12 one year later, Morty will not exercise the option and will be out $100:
 
 
   $1,000 for the stocks and $100 for the option = $1,100 Stock appreciates to $1,200 $100 lost by not exercising the option But gains $100 ($1,200 - $1,000 paid for stock - $100 paid for option) 
 
 
  If the stock price fell to $0, Morty would exercise the option and sell the shares for $8, for a loss:
 
 
   $1,100 for stocks and the option Sold shares for $800 Total loss of $300 
 
 
  Without the option, Morty would have lost the entire investment of $1,000.
 
 
    Hedging Through Diversification    
  Strategically  diversifying  a portfolio to reduce certain risks can also be considered a hedge. For example,","By

 Definition 
 A subsidiary company is a business that's owned by another company. 
    What Is a Subsidiary Company?    
  In the corporate world, a subsidiary is a business entity that is owned in part or whole by a different company.
 
 
  The company with the controlling share is known as the  parent company  or the  holding company . The parent company owns or controls more than half of the subsidiary's stock.
 
 
  In cases where a subsidiary is 100% owned by its parent company, the subsidiary is referred to as a  wholly-owned subsidiary .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Subsidiaries are separate and distinct from their parent companies and operate independently of them. A company might buy or establish a subsidiary to obtain specific synergies or assets, secure tax advantages, and/or limit losses. Shareholder approval is not required to turn a company into a subsidiary or to sell a subsidiary. A subsidiary's financials are reported on the parent company's consolidated financial statements.

    How a Subsidiary Company Works    
  Subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities from their parent companies, which is reflected in the independence of their liabilities, taxation, and governance.
 
 
  However, given their controlling interest, parent companies often have  considerable influence over their subsidiaries .

  They—along with other subsidiary shareholders, if any—vote to elect a subsidiary company's board of directors, and there may often be a board-member overlap between a subsidiary and its parent company.
 
 
   Important 
 To be designated a subsidiary, at least 50% of a company's equity has to be controlled by another entity. Anything less, and the company is considered an  associate  or  affiliate  company. 
 
 
 
    Subsidiary Company Financials    
  A subsidiary usually prepares its own, independent  financial statements . Typically, these are sent to the parent company, which will aggregate them—as it does financials from all of its operations—and carry them on its  consolidated financial statements .
 
 
 
 
  In contrast, an associate company's financials are not combined with the parent company's. Instead, the parent company registers the value of its stake in the associate company as an asset on its  balance sheet .
 
 
  Accounting standards generally require that public companies consolidate in their records all majority-owned subsidiaries.
 
 
   Consolidation  is viewed as a more meaningful method of accounting than separate financials for a parent company and each of its subsidiaries. 1 
 
 
    Unconsolidated Subsidiary    
  An  unconsolidated subsidiary  is a subsidiary with financials that are not included in its parent company's statements.
 
 
  Ownership of unconsolidated subsidiaries is typically treated as an equity investment and denoted as an asset on the parent company's balance sheet.
 
 
  For regulatory reasons, unconsolidated subsidiaries are generally those in which a parent company does not have a significant stake. 1 2 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  states that only in rare cases, such as when a subsidiary is undergoing  bankruptcy , should a majority-owned subsidiary not be consolidated. 2

 Definition 
 Vesting is a process by which an employee obtains ownership rights in work-related benefits, such as stock options, stock shares, and certain retirement plan assets. 
    What Is Vesting?    
  Vesting, whereby employees gain non-forfeitable ownership of certain assets or benefits, requires employees to work for a company for a specified term of years.
 
 
  Vesting is a way for employers to keep top-performing employees at their companies. When an employee becomes vested in employer-matching retirement benefits like a  401(k)  or  stock options , they have non-forfeitable ownership rights to those assets.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Being vested gives an employee non-forfeitable ownership rights to certain assets. Employee contributions to an employer-sponsored retirement plan are always immediately vested; employer contributions may or may not be. A common vesting schedule is three to five years. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Sydney Saporito 
 
    How Vesting Works    
  Employees commonly contribute a percentage of their paycheck to their 401(k)s, and their employer may  match  part or all of that contribution. Employee contributions immediately vest and are completely owned by the employee. 1 
 
 
  Employer contributions to a 401(k) plan  might or might not vest immediately . A company may have a vesting schedule that determines when employees acquire full ownership of the portion contributed by the employer.
 
 
  In fact, matched dollars usually take several years to vest, meaning an employee must stay with the company long enough to be eligible to receive them.

  The vesting process for stock bonuses offers employers a valuable employee retention tool. For example, an employee might receive 100  restricted stock units  as an annual bonus.
 
 
  To entice this valued employee to remain with the company for five years, the stock may vest according to the following schedule:
 
 
   25 units in the second year after the bonus was awarded 25 units in year three 25 units in year four 25 units in year five 
 
 
  If the employee left the company after year three, only 50 units would be vested. The other 50 would be forfeited. This means the employee would have ownership rights for 50 units and lose the opportunity to own 50 more.
 
 
   Important 
 Employee contributions to an employer-sponsored retirement plan are always considered 100% vested when made. 1 
 
 
 
    Types of Vesting    
   Cliff Vesting Schedule:  Gives the employee ownership of 100% of the employer’s contributions all at once after a certain number of years. 1 Graded Vesting Schedule:  Gives the employee ownership of a percentage of the employer’s contribution each year. 1 
 
 
  Traditional pension plans, for example, might have a five-year cliff vesting schedule or a three- to seven-year graded vesting schedule.
 
 
  Although an employee may be fully vested in their employer’s contributions, it does not mean they can withdraw that money whenever they want without penalty.
 
 
  They are still subject to the plan’s rules, which generally require them to reach age 59½ before allowing penalty-free withdrawals.

  An economy can encompass a nation, a region, a single industry, or even just one family.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The production and consumption of goods and services fulfill the needs of those living and operating within an economy. Market-based economies, sometimes called free market economies, are self-regulated, allowing goods to be produced and distributed in response to demand from consumers. Command-based economies are regulated by a government body that determines the goods that are produced, their quantities, and their prices. In the modern world, few economies are purely market-based or command-based. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   The U.S. is an example of mixed economy, combining elements of capitalism and socialism. 
 Investopedia / Alex Dos Diaz 
 
    Understanding Economies    
  An economy encompasses all of the activities related to the production, consumption, and trade of goods and services in an entity, whether the entity is a nation or a small town.
 
 
  No two economies are identical. Each is formed according to its own resources, culture, laws, history, and geography. Each evolves according to the choices and actions of the participants.
 
 
  These decisions are made through some combination of market transactions and collective or hierarchical decision-making.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Capitalism is characterized by a market-based economy. Communism is characterized by a command-based economy. 
 
 
 
    Types of Economies    
  In the modern world, few nations are purely market-based or purely command-based. But most lean toward one or the other of these models. 
 
 
    Market-Based Economies    
  Market-based economies enable people and businesses to freely exchange goods and services based on supply and demand.
 
 
  The United States is mostly a  market economy . Producers determine what is sold and produced, as well as the prices to charge. If they expect to succeed, they will produce what consumers want and charge what consumers are willing to pay.  
 
 
  Through these decisions, the laws of supply and demand determine prices and total production. If consumer demand for a specific product increases, production tends to increase to satisfy the demand. The increased demand causes prices to rise until consumers balk and cut back on their purchases. Demand for the product will then decline, and prices will decrease with it.
 
 
  This constant tug of supply and demand creates a tendency for a market economy to naturally balance itself. As the prices in one sector rise with demand, the money and labor needed to fill that demand shift to those places where they're needed.
 
 
    Command-Based Economies    
   Command-based economies  depend on a central government that controls production levels, pricing, and distribution of goods. A command-based economy attempts to supersede the workings of supply and demand.
 
 
  In such a system, the government owns industries deemed essential on behalf of the consumers who use them. Competition among companies is discouraged or banned. Prices are controlled.
 
 
  Communism requires a command-based economy. Contemporary examples include Cuba and North Korea.

 Definition 
 A 401(a) plan is a retirement savings program created and managed by certain public-sector or non-profit employers, where contribution rules and investment choices are primarily set by the employer. It's generally mandatory for employees to partake. 
    What Is a 401(a) Plan?    
  A 401(a) plan is an employer-sponsored money-purchase  retirement plan  that allows dollar or percentage-based contributions from the employer, the employee, or both. The sponsoring employer establishes eligibility and the  vesting  schedule. The employee can withdraw funds from a 401(a) plan through a rollover to a different qualified retirement plan, a lump-sum payment, or an annuity.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A 401(a) plan is employer-sponsored, and both the employer and employee can contribute. 401(a) plans are usually used by government and non-profit organizations. 401(a) plans give the employer a larger share of control over how the plan is invested. An employee can withdraw funds from a 401(a) plan through a rollover to a different qualified retirement plan, a lump-sum payment, or an annuity. Investments in 401(a) plans are low risk and typically include government bonds and funds focused on value-based stocks. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
    How a 401(a) Plan Works    
  There are a variety of retirement plans that employers can offer their employees. Each comes with different stipulations, restrictions, and some are better suited for certain types of employers.
 
 
  A 401(a) plan is a type of retirement plan made available to those working in government agencies, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations. Eligible employees who participate in the plan include government employees, teachers, administrators, and support staff.
 
 
  A 401(a) plan's features are similar to a  401(k) plan , which is more common in profit-based industries. 401(a) plans do not allow employees to contribute to 401(k) plans, however.
 
 
 
 
  If an individual leaves an employer, they do have the option of transferring the funds in their 401(a) to a 401(k) plan or  individual retirement account  (IRA).

  Employers can form multiple 401(a) plans, each with distinct eligibility criteria, contribution amounts, and vesting schedules. Employers use these plans to create incentive programs for employee retention. The employer controls the plan and determines the contribution limits.
 
 
    Contributions for a 401(a) Plan    
  A 401(a) plan can have mandatory or voluntary contributions, and the employer decides if contributions are made on an after-tax or pre-tax basis. An employer contributes funds to the plan on an employee's behalf.
 
 
  Employer contribution options include the employer paying a set amount into an employee's plan, matching a fixed percentage of employee contributions, or matching employee contributions within a specific dollar range.
 
 
  The majority of voluntary contributions to a 401(a) plan are capped at a percentage of an employee's annual pay. For example, an employee may only be allowed to contribute no more than 25% of their pay. 1

"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): Meaning, Components, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrates and manages a company's core business processes to streamline operations and improve communication across departments. 
    What Is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)?    
  Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a platform companies use to manage and integrate the essential parts of their businesses. Many ERP software applications are critical to companies because they help them implement resource planning by integrating all the processes needed to run their companies with a single system.
 
 
  An ERP software system can also integrate planning, purchasing inventory, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and more.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 ERP software can integrate all of the processes needed to run a company. ERP solutions have evolved over the years, and many are now typically web-based applications that users can access remotely. Some benefits of ERP include the free flow of communication between business areas, a single source of information, and accurate, real-time data reporting. There are hundreds of ERP applications a company can choose from, and most can be customized. An ERP system can be ineffective if a company doesn't implement it carefully. 
 
 
 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Joules Garcia 
 
    Understanding Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)    
  You can think of an enterprise resource planning system as the glue that binds together the different computer systems for a large organization. Without an ERP application, each department would have its system optimized for its specific tasks. With ERP software, each department still has its system, but all of the systems can be accessed through one application with one interface.
 
 
 
 
  ERP applications also allow the different departments to communicate and share information more easily with the rest of the company. It collects information about the activity and state of different divisions, making this information available to other parts, where it can be used productively.
 
 
  ERP applications can help a corporation become more self-aware by linking information about production, finance, distribution, and human resources together. Because it connects different technologies used by each part of a business, an ERP application can eliminate costly duplicates and incompatible technology. The process often integrates accounts payable, stock control systems, order-monitoring systems, and customer databases into one system.
 
 
    How Enterprise Resource Planning Platforms Work    
  ERP has evolved over the years from traditional software models that made use of physical client servers and manual entry systems to cloud-based software with remote, web-based access. The platform is generally maintained by the company that created it, with client companies renting services provided by the platform.
 
 
  Businesses select the applications they want to use. Then, the hosting company loads the applications onto the server the client is renting, and both parties begin working to integrate the client's processes and data into the platform.
 
 
  Once all departments are tied into the system, all data is collected on the server and becomes instantly available to those with permission to use it. Reports can be generated with metrics, graphs, or other visuals and aids a client might need to determine how the business and its departments are performing.
 
 
   Important 
 A company could experience cost overruns if its ERP system is not implemented carefully. 
 
 
 
    Types of ERP Systems    
  There's a number of different ERP solutions that can meet a variety of business needs. This list is not meant to list every single type of ERP, though the list is pretty comprehensive. Any business considering implementing an ERP system should be able to find value in some of these types of systems, and multiple systems may be relevant in any given situation.
 
 
    On-Premise ERP    
  On-premises ERP systems involve purchasing the software licenses and installing the ERP system directly onto a company's own servers. Companies have full control over the system and data, as it resides within their premises. Customization and integration with existing systems can be more extensive, and this type of ERP usually requires dedicated IT resources for maintenance, updates, and security.
 
 
    Cloud ERP    
  Cloud ERP systems are hosted on remote servers and accessed through the internet. Cloud ERPs like  SaaS products  offer better scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust resources and features as needed without significant upfront investment in hardware. Cloud ERP systems typically have a subscription-based pricing model, and updates/maintenance are managed by the ERP provider (not the company itself).

What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)? How It Works and Example,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?    
  Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two distinct forms of identification in order to access something.
 
 
  Two-factor authentication can be used to strengthen the security of an online account, a smartphone, or even a door. 2FA does this by requiring two types of information from the user—a password or  personal identification number (PIN) , a code sent to the user's smartphone (called a  message authentication code ), or a fingerprint—before whatever is being secured can be accessed.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two separate, distinct forms of identification in order to access something. The first factor is a password and the second commonly includes a text with a code sent to your smartphone, or biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina. While 2FA does improve security, it is not foolproof. 
 
    Understanding Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)    
  Two-factor authentication is designed to  prevent unauthorized users  from gaining access to an account with nothing more than a stolen password. Users may be at greater risk of compromised passwords than they realize, particularly if they use the same password on more than one website. Downloading software and clicking on links in emails can also expose an individual to password theft. 1 2 
 
 
  Two-factor authentication is a combination of two of the following: 2 
 
 
   Something you know (your password) Something you have (such as a text with a code sent to your smartphone or other device, or a smartphone authenticator app) Something you are (biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina) 
 
 
  2FA is not just applied to online contexts. It is also at work when a consumer is required to enter their zip code before using their credit card at a gas pump or when a user is required to enter an authentication code from an RSA SecurID key fob to log in remotely to an employer’s system. 2 
 
 
   Important 
 Despite the slight inconvenience of a longer log-in process, security experts recommend enabling 2FA wherever possible: email accounts, password managers, social media applications, cloud storage services, financial services, and more. 
 
 
 
    Examples of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)    
  Apple account holders can use 2FA to ensure that accounts can only be accessed from trusted devices. If a user tries to log in to their iCloud account from a different computer, the user will need the password, but also a multi-digit code that Apple will send to one of the user's devices, such as their iPhone. 3 
 
 
 
 
  Many businesses also deploy 2FA to control access to company networks and data. Employees may be required to enter an additional code to sign into the  remote desktop software  that allows them to connect to their work computers from outside the office.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  While 2FA does improve security, it is not foolproof. Two-factor authentication goes a step further in  verifying identity  from the user simply entering a PIN or CVV number from their credit card.
 
 
  However, hackers who acquire the authentication factors can still gain unauthorized access to accounts. Common ways to do so include  phishing  attacks, account recovery procedures, and malware.
 
 
  Hackers can also intercept text messages used in 2FA. Critics argue that text messages are not a true form of 2FA since they are not something the user already has but rather something the user is sent, and the sending process is vulnerable. Instead, the critics argue that this process should be called two-step verification. Some companies, such as Google, use this term. 4 
 
 
  Still, even two-step verification is more secure than password protection alone. Even stronger is multi-factor authentication, which requires more than two factors before account access will be granted.

Code of Ethics: Understanding Its Types and Uses,"What Is a Code of Ethics?    
  A code of ethics is a set of principles intended to guide professionals in conducting business with honesty and integrity. A code of ethics document may outline the organization’s mission and values, guide on addressing problems, establish ethical principles based on the organization’s core values, and define the standards to which professionals are held.
 
 
  To evaluate corporate codes of ethics ethically, you must apply universal moral standards like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship to the stages of content, creation, implementation, and administration. 1 
 
 
  Also called an “ethical code,” a code of ethics may encompass areas such as  business ethics , professional practices, and employee conduct.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A code of ethics outlines an organization’s guidelines and best practices for maintaining honesty, integrity, and professionalism. Violating the code of ethics can lead to sanctions, including termination, for organization employees or members. Specific laws regulate business conduct in some industries, including banking and finance, while in others, a code of ethics is voluntarily adopted. The main types of codes of ethics include compliance-based, value-based, and professional codes of ethics. Addressing climate change has become a key component of companies’ codes of ethics, highlighting their commitment to sustainability. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Joules Garcia / Investopedia 
 
    What Is the Purpose of a Code of Ethics?    
  Business ethics refers to how ethical principles guide a business’s operations. Common issues that fall under the umbrella of business ethics include employer-employee relations, discrimination, environmental issues, bribery,  insider trading , and social responsibility.
 
 
  Although many laws establish basic ethical standards for businesses, it’s primarily up to business leaders to develop a comprehensive code of ethics.
 
 
 
 
  Ethical conduct has been shown to benefit an organization and society in the long term. It aligns with the  triple bottom line  theory of profit, people, and planet and meets the growing expectations of socially responsible customers, employees, and investors. 2 
 
 
  Businesses and trade organizations usually have a code of ethics that employees or members must follow. Violating this code can lead to termination or dismissal. A code of ethics is crucial because it clearly defines the rules for behavior and offers a basis for preemptive warnings.
 
 
   Important 
 While a code of ethics is often not required, many firms and organizations adopt one to identify and characterize their business to  stakeholders . This can build trust, ensure accountability, and demonstrate a commitment to ethical behavior, all of which can improve a company’s reputation and contribute to its success. 
 
 
 
  Given the importance of climate change and the significant impact of human behavior, many companies now include climate factors in their code of ethics. These principles outline the company’s dedication to operating sustainably or their plans to shift toward sustainable practices.
 
 
  Although this commitment to  sustainability  can increase costs, it often proves worthwhile as consumers increasingly prefer to engage with environmentally responsible businesses, enhancing the company’s public image.
 
 
  Regardless of size, businesses count on their management staff to set ethical conduct standards for other employees. When leaders adhere to the code of ethics, universal compliance is expected, with no exceptions.
 
 
    Types of Codes of Ethics    
  A code of ethics can take various forms. Still, its general goal is to ensure that a business and its employees follow state and federal laws, conduct themselves according to exemplary standards, and benefit all stakeholders. Here are two types of codes of ethics commonly found in business.
 
 
    Compliance-Based Code of Ethics    
  For all businesses, laws regulate issues such as hiring and safety standards. Compliance-based codes of ethics set guidelines for conduct and determine penalties for violations.
 
 
  Specific laws govern business conduct in industries like banking, leading these sectors to adopt compliance-based codes of ethics to enforce regulations. Employees typically undergo formal training to understand these rules. Noncompliance can create legal issues for the company, and individual employees may face penalties for failing to follow guidelines.
 
 
  Some companies appoint a  compliance officer  to ensure adherence to the code of ethics. This individual stays updated on regulatory changes and monitors employee conduct to encourage conformity.
 
 
  This type of code of ethics is based on  clear-cut rules  and defined consequences rather than personal behavior monitoring. While it ensures legal compliance, it may not always promote a climate of moral responsibility within a company.

What Is a Geometric Mean? How to Calculate and Example,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Geometric Mean?    
  The geometric mean is the average of a set of products. Analysts, portfolio managers, and others commonly use the calculation of the geometric mean to determine the performance results of an investment or portfolio.
 
 
  Technically, a geometric mean is defined as ""the  nth  root product of  n  numbers."" The geometric mean must be used when working with percentages, which are derived from values, while the standard arithmetic mean works with the values themselves. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The geometric mean is the average of a set of values calculated using the products of the terms. The geometric mean is most appropriate for series that exhibit serial correlation—especially investment portfolios. Most returns in finance are correlated, including yields on bonds, stock returns, and market risk premiums. For volatile numbers, the geometric mean provides a far more accurate measurement of the true return by considering year-over-year compounding, which smooths the mean. 
 
    Understanding the Geometric Mean    
  The geometric mean, sometimes referred to as  compounded annual growth rate  or  time-weighted rate of return , is the average rate of return of a set of values calculated using the products of the terms. What does that mean? The geometric mean multiplies several values and sets them to the 1/nth power.
 
 
  For various reasons, the geometric mean is an important tool for calculating  portfolio performance . One of the most significant of those reasons is that it takes into account the  effects of compounding .
 
 
  For example, the geometric mean calculation can be easily understood with simple numbers, such as 2 and 8. If you multiply 2 and 8, then take the square root (the ½ power since there are only two numbers), the answer is 4. However, when there are many numbers, it is more difficult to calculate unless a calculator or computer program is used.

 μ geometric = [ ( 1 + R 1 ) ( 1 + R 2 ) … ( 1 + R n ) ] 1 / n − 1 where: ∙ R 1 … R n  are the returns of an asset (or other observations for averaging) . \begin{aligned} &\mu _{\text{geometric}} = [(1+R _1)(1+R _2)\ldots(1+R _n)]^{1/n} - 1\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\bullet R_1\ldots R_n \text{ are the returns of an asset (or other}\\ &\text{observations for averaging)}. \end{aligned} ​ μ geometric ​ = [ ( 1 + R 1 ​ ) ( 1 + R 2 ​ ) … ( 1 + R n ​ ) ] 1 / n − 1 where: ∙ R 1 ​ … R n ​  are the returns of an asset (or other observations for averaging) . ​ 
 Calculating Geometric Mean 
 Imagine that your portfolio returned the following amounts each year for five years: 
 
 Year one: 5% 
 Year two: 3% 
 Year three: 6% 
 Year four: 2% 
 Year five: 4% 
 
 You would use the formula with those values: 
 
 [ ( 1 + .05)(1 + .03)(1 + .06)(1 + .02)(1 + .04) ]  1/5  - 1 
 [1.05 x 1.03 x 1.06 x 1.02 x 1.04] 1/5  - 1 
 [1.2161] 1/5  - 1 
 [1.2161] .2  -1 = .0399 
 
 Multiply the result by 100%, and your portfolio returned a geometric mean of 3.99% over five years, slightly less than the arithmetic mean of (5+3+6+2+4) ÷ 5 = 4. 
 Calculate the Geometric Mean in a Spreadsheet 
 You can also use the  Geomean  function of a Google Sheet to calculate the geometric mean of the previous returns.

"Zero Balance Account (ZBA): Definition in Banking, and Pros and Cons","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Zero Balance Account (ZBA)?    
  A zero balance account (ZBA) is exactly what it sounds like: a checking account in which a balance of $0 is maintained. When funds are needed in the ZBA, the exact amount of money required is automatically transferred from a central or master account. Similarly, deposits in these accounts are swept into a master account daily.
 
 
  Corporations sometimes use zero balance accounts to ensure funds are readily available throughout different departments, eliminate excess balances in separate accounts, and maintain greater control over the  disbursement  of funds. These accounts often handle items such as payroll, petty cash, and other needs. 1  ZBAs aren't usually used by individual consumers.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A zero balance account (ZBA) is an account in which a balance of zero is maintained by transferring funds to and from a master account. ZBAs aren't consumer products but are used by larger businesses. An organization may have multiple zero balance subaccounts to monitor and track spending by department or project. ZBAs promote risk mitigation, as a company has greater control over where its cash balances are and what unauthorized spending may occur. ZBAs are typically heavily automated. Though this limits clerical errors and incites operational efficiency in some ways, a business must still monitor and reconcile its bank statements. 
 
    How Zero Balance Accounts (ZBAs) Work    
  The master account provides a centralized place to manage an organization's funds. Whenever funds are required in the ZBA  checking account  to cover a charge or transaction, money is transferred from the master account in the exact amount required. 2  An employee does not need to do this manually, as the process is fully automated. 
 
 
   Important 
 The ZBA's activity is limited to the processing of payments instead of maintaining a running balance. 
 
 
 
  Using a ZBA to fund  debit cards  issued by the organization helps ensure that all card activity is pre-approved. Because  idle funds  aren't present within the ZBA, running a debit card transaction is impossible until funds are supplied to the account.
 
 
 
 
  Using a ZBA as a spending control mechanism is especially helpful when managing  incidental charges  across a large organization. By limiting quick access to funds via debit cards, proper approval procedures are more likely to be followed prior to the completion of a purchase. This permits easy tracking of transfers and reconciliation across accounts.

    Advantages and Disadvantages of ZBAs    
  Transactions from ZBAs are self-managed, often saving the account holder time from not having to manually rebalance or fund transactions. ZBAs may also be easier to reconcile, audit, or receive department-level reporting on spending.
 
 
  Because so much of ZBAs is automated, many companies find there are fewer clerical errors or transaction failures due to human error, which saves on overdraft fees. ZBAs are also great control mechanisms to monitor spending. If a company has one main account instead of many accounts with bank balances, it can mitigate the chance of its bank account being compromised by unapproved or fraudulent transactions.
 
 
   Tip 
 ZBAs maximize funds available for corporate investment and minimize the risk of overdraft fees. 
 
 
 
  By concentrating funds in the master account, more money is available for investments rather than having small dollar amounts idle within a variety of subaccounts. The master account often has additional benefits, such as a higher  interest rate  on balances.
 
 
  There are some downsides to ZBAs. Although sweeping and transfers are automatic, the business must still reconcile bank statements and monitor for failed transactions. Should a transaction fail to process or be canceled, money moved into that account may automatically be swept back, resulting in multiple unnecessary transactions. Last, while intended to relieve administrative burdens, ZBAs proliferate the number of bank accounts a company owns and may result in higher administrative demands.
 
 
    Requirements To Open ZBAs    
  Not everyone can qualify for a ZBA. Banks often do not offer this product to general consumers and only offer this solution to companies. In addition, banks may not provide ZBAs to small, unestablished businesses.
 
 
  By their nature, ZBAs must have a linked master account, and the bank offering the ZBA will likely require the master account to be held at their institution. The bank may also require transaction history evidence, historical average bank balances, estimated spend projections, and ap","By

 Definition 
 Profit refers to a company's surplus revenue after accounting for its costs and expenses during a certain period, such as a quarter or fiscal year. 
    What Is Profit?    
  A profit occurs when a company's revenue exceeds its expenses. Put simply it's what a business gets to keep after paying for everything it takes to make or sell its products or services. There are different types of profit. Gross profit is what a business earns after deducting all of its costs of goods sold (COGS). Operating profit is the money it earns from its day-to-day activities and excludes interest and taxes. Net profit is what's left over after paying all of its costs. A highly profitable company is better poised to manage its costs and financial obligations. Companies often share their profits with their shareholders or reinvest them into the business. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Profit refers to the money companies keep after paying all of their expenses. Gross profit equals sales minus the cost of goods sold. Operating profit accounts for expenses like overhead and depreciation. Net profit is also referred to as the bottom line. Companies can distribute profits to shareholders as dividends or reinvest them back into the business. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Companies can sell a lot, but may not realize a profit if they can't manage their costs. 
 Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin 
 
    How Profit Is Calculated    
  Profit is the money a business pulls in after accounting for all expenses. Whether it's a lemonade stand or a publicly-traded multinational company, the primary goal of any business is to earn money.
 
 
  Some analysts look at top-line profitability, whereas others are interested in profitability before taxes and other expenses. Still others are only concerned with profitability after all costs have been paid.
 
 
  The three major types of profit are gross profit, operating profit, and net profit, found on a company's  income statement . Each profit type provides analysts with more information about a company's performance compared to competitors.
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The word “profit” comes from the Latin noun  profectus , meaning “progress,” and the verb  proficere , meaning “to advance.” 
 
 
 
    Gross Profit    
  The first level of profitability is  gross profit , which equals sales minus the cost of goods sold. Sales are the first line item on the income statement, and the  cost of goods sold  (COGS) is generally listed just below it:

  Gross Profit = Revenues - COGS
 
 
  For example, if Company A has $100,000 in sales and a COGS of $60,000, it means the gross profit is $40,000, or $100,000 minus $60,000. Divide gross profit by sales for the  gross profit margin , which is 40%, or $40,000 divided by $100,000.
 
 
    Operating Profit    
  Operating profit removes operating expenses such as overhead and other indirect costs, as well as accounting costs like  depreciation  and amortization.  Operating profit  is sometimes referred to as earnings before interest and taxes, or  EBIT .

What Is a Disbursement?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A disbursement is a payment that's debited from a payer's account and then credited to the payee's account. 
    What Is a Disbursement?    
  A disbursement is a payment to an individual or entity from a private or public fund. It may also be a payment made on behalf of a client to a third party, money paid into a business's operating budget, the delivery of a loan amount to a borrower, or a  dividend to shareholders .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A disbursement is the delivery of money from a fund. A disbursement is recorded in the general ledger in business accounting. A record of disbursements shows how a business spends its cash. Payments of dividends to shareholders are often termed disbursements. Student loan money paid into a school's account on behalf of a student is a disbursement. 
 
    Examples of Disbursements    
  Disbursements can take many forms.
 
 
    Loans    
  A loan is disbursed when the agreed-upon amount is paid into the borrower's account and is available for use. The cash has been debited from the lender's account and credited to the borrower's account.
 
 
    Tuition    
  A student loan disbursement is the payout of loan proceeds on behalf of a student. Schools and loan servicers notify students of the expected receipt of the disbursements in writing, including the amount of the loan and its effective date. A university or college may also directly give students grant money in payments that are referred to as disbursements. 
 
 
    Insurance claims    
  An insurance company will disburse money for repairs after an insurance adjuster has inspected damage to a home or property. The disbursement is based on the terms and limits of policies such as a homeowner's or automobile policy.

    Business operations    
  Disbursement is part of  cash flow  and a record of day-to-day expenses. It can be an early warning of insolvency if disbursements are higher than revenues.
 
 
    Retirement account withdrawals    
  It's recorded on the account as a balance drawdown when money is disbursed from a retirement account.
 
 
    Controlled disbursements    
  Controlled disbursements are a cash flow management service for a bank's corporate clients.  Controlled disbursement  allows customers to review and reschedule disbursements on a day-to-day basis. Clients maximize the interest they earn on the cash in their accounts by delaying when money is debited from the account.
 
 
    Third-party payments    
  A lawyer will commonly complete and record disbursements when paying for services on behalf of a client. These disbursements may include payments to various  third parties  for costs such as court fees, private investigator services, courier services, and expert reports.
 
 
   Important 
 Remote or  delayed disbursement  deliberately stalls the payment process by paying with a check drawn from a bank located in a remote region. Banks could process a payment only when the original paper check was received so this delayed the debit to the payer's account for several business days. Electronic transfers have made delayed disbursements less common. 
 
 
 
    Accounting for Disbursements    
  A company makes disbursements during a set period in bookkeeping such as a quarter or a year. A bookkeeper records each transaction and posts it to one or more ledgers such as a  cash disbursement journal  and the  general ledger . Disbursements are recorded with the date, the payee name, the amount debited or credited, the payment method, and the purpose of the payment.
 
 
  The overall cash balance of the business is adjusted to account for the transaction. Disbursement journals and ledgers are records of the money flowing out and may differ from actual profit or loss. A company that uses the  accrual method of accounting  reports expenses when they occur, not necessarily when they're paid, and it reports income when it's earned, not when it is received.
 
 
  The type of items listed in the ledger depends on the business. A retailer has payments for inventory,  accounts payable , and salaries. A manufacturer has transactions for raw materials and production costs.
 
 
    Disbursement vs. Drawdown    
  A disbursement is a payment. A  drawdown  is the consequence of a particular type of disbursement. A retiree receives a disbursement when money is withdrawn from a retirement account. That disbursement represents a drawdown on the balance in their account.
 
 
  A retiree receives a $10,000 disbursement when they withdraw 10% of a $100,000 balance in a traditional IRA account. This represents a drawdown of $10,000 or 10% from the account which results in a balan","By

What Is Net Profit Margin? Formula and Examples,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Net profit margin is a metric that includes all factors of a company’s operation and predicts profits based on current revenue. 
    What Is Net Profit Margin?    
  Net profit margin (otherwise known as net margin) is a measure of how much profit (or  net income ) a business generates. Most often, the net profit margin is shown as a percentage but it may also be represented by a decimal.
 
 
  The net profit margin shows how much of each dollar a business earns actually translates into profit. It’s calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its total revenue and multiplying that figure by 100.
 
 
  We’ll take a deeper dive into the net profit margin formula, including both hypothetical and real examples later in this article.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Net profit margin is a true measure of a business’s profit represented as a percentage of its revenue.  Net profit margin is a crucial metric in determining the overall financial standing of a business. Investors often rely on net profit margin as a key indicator of a company’s financial health and potential for growth. 
 
   Tip 
 Take a look at a company’s net profit margin as a first assessment of its overall value. 
 
 
 
    How Net Profit Margin Works     
  Net profit margin is one of the most comprehensive profitability metrics, as it includes all factors of a company’s operation. Carefully tracking fluctuations in net profit margin allows businesses to determine whether their current strategy is effective and accurately predict  profits  based on current revenue.
 
 
  Since net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage, it’s simple to compare the profitability of two or more companies even if they vary in size and scope.

  Net profit margin includes all the below factors in a business's operations: 1 
 
 
 
 Total  revenue 
 Cost of goods sold (COGS)  and various additional expenses 
 Investment income  and any income earned from secondary operations 
 Any interest expenses incurred on  debt 
 Corporate tax expenses 
 Timely payments for unusual events, such as business structuring or legal expenses 
 
 
  A business’s net profit margin is an important metric for investors to determine the profitability of a company and whether or not the business is a good investment. Generally, if a business has a growing revenue, but its operating expenses are increasing, its net profit margin will decrease. Maintaining a strong record of increasing profit margins coupled with shrinking expenses may make a business more attractive to prospective  investors . 
 
 
   Tip 
 A company can regularly review costs and pricing strategies to optimize revenue and increase its net profit margin. 
 
 
 
    Formula and Calculation for Net Profit Margin    
  To calculate net profit margin, use the following formula: 
 Net profit margin = R − C O G S − E − I − T R ∗ 1 0 0 = Net income R ∗ 1 0 0 where: R = Revenue C O G S = The cost of goods sold E = Operating and other expenses I = Interest T = Taxes \begin{aligned} \text{Net profit margin} &= \frac{R - COGS - E - I - T}{R}*100\\ &= \frac{\text{Net income}}{R}*100\\ \textbf{where:}\\ R &= \text{Revenue}\\ COGS &= \text{The cost of goods sold}\\ E &= \text{Operating and other expenses}\\ I &= \text{Interest}\\ T &= \text{Taxes} \end{aligned} Net profit margin where: R C O G S E I T ​ = R R − C O G S − E − I − T ​ ∗ 1 0 0 = R Net income ​ ∗ 1 0 0 = Revenue = The cost of goods sold = Operating and other expenses = Interest = Taxes ​ 
 Where: 
 
 Net Income  = Revenue - all costs and expenses (including COGS, operating expenses, taxes, interest, and any other costs). 
 Total Revenue  = The total sales or revenue generated by the company. 
 
 
 Subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS),  operating expenses  and other expenses,  interest  owed, and any applicable taxes from the total revenue. 
 Divide that result by total revenue. 
 Turn that figure into a percentage by multiplying it by 100. 
 
 
    Examples of Net Profit Margin    
  Here’s a hypothetical example of net profit margin for Company X:
 
 
   Revenue: $150,000 COGS or cost of goods sold: $30,000 Operating costs: $30,000 Interest: $5,000 Tax liability: $18,000 Net profits: $67,000 
 
 
  In this case, Company X’s net profit margin is 44.6% ($67,000 ÷ $150,000 x 100). A 44.6% profit margin indicates that a business earns around 44 to 45 cents in profit for every dollar it collects. 
 
 
  Here’s a real-world example of net profit margin:

 Definition 
 An asset can be anything that has a monetary value that produces income for its owner or that could produce income if used or sold. 
    What Is an Asset?    
  An asset is a resource, tangible or intangible, that holds some monetary value that can be exploited by its owner. The asset may produce income, such as rental fees, or may produce a profit if sold, such as stocks or jewelry.
 
 
  For an individual or a family, assets may include a home, savings, investments, and personal possessions that have intrinsic value.
 
 
  A company categorizes its assets as current assets, like inventory, which is intended for immediate use; fixed assets, like a factory and its equipment; financial assets, such as stock investments, and intangible assets, like goodwill.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Assets are things that have value.  An asset may produce income, now or in the future. An asset may appreciate in value over time. In business, an asset may generate cash flow, reduce expenses, or improve sales. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Nez Riaz 
 
    How Assets Work    
  Individuals usually think of assets as items of value that can be converted into cash at some future point and that might also be income-producing or appreciating in value until that time. They can be financial assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds or physical assets like a home or an art collection.
 
 
  An asset may be something that has the potential to generate cash flow in the case of businesses. It might reduce expenses or improve sales regardless of whether it's a  tangible asset  like manufacturing equipment or a fleet of trucks or an  intangible asset  like a patent or a trademark.

  A company must possess a right to the asset as of the date of its financial statements for it to be counted as one of its assets.
 
 
 
 
    Types of Assets    
  Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet and can be broadly categorized into current or short-term assets,  fixed assets , financial assets, or intangible assets.
 
 
    Current Assets    
   Current assets  are short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash or consumed within one year. Current assets can include cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable , physical inventory, and various prepaid expenses. 1 
 
 
  Cash is easy to value but accountants must periodically reassess the recoverability of inventory and accounts receivable. A receivable will be classified as  impaired  if there's evidence that it might be uncollectible. Companies might have to  write off  those assets if inventory becomes obsolete.
 
 
   Important 
 Some assets are recorded on companies' balance sheets using the concept of  historical cost . It represents the original cost of the asset when it was purchased by the company and it can also include expenses such as delivery and setup incurred to incorporate an asset into the company's operations. 
 
 
 
    Fixed Assets    
  Fixed assets are resources with an expected life of more than a year, such as plants, equipment, and buildings. An accounting adjustment known as  depreciation  is made for fixed assets as they age. It allocates the cost of the asset over time.

 Definition 
 Real estate is property that consists of land and any permanent structures or improvements on it or made to it. 
    What Is Real Estate?    
  Real estate is defined as the land and any permanent structures, like a home, or improvements attached to the land, whether natural or artificial.
 
 
  Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached to it or built on it, whether natural or artificial. There are five main categories of real estate, which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use. Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, a rental property, or land. Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
    Understanding Real Estate    
  The terms  land ,  real estate , and  real property  are often used interchangeably, but there are distinctions.
 
 
  Land   refers to the earth's surface down to the center of the planet, including the trees, minerals, and water. The physical characteristics of land include its immobility, indestructibility, and uniqueness, where each parcel of land differs geographically.
 
 
  Real estate encompasses the land, plus any permanent artificial additions, such as houses and other buildings. Any additions or changes to the land that affect the property's value are called an improvement.
 
 
  Once land is improved, the total capital and labor used to build the improvement represent a sizable fixed investment. Though a building can be razed, improvements like drainage, electricity, water, and sewer systems tend to be permanent.
 
 
 
 
  Real property includes the land and additions to the land, plus the rights inherent to its ownership and usage.
 
 
   Real Estate Agent 
 A real estate agent is a licensed professional who arranges real estate transactions, matching buyers and sellers and acting as their representatives in negotiations. 
 
    What Are Types of Real Estate?    
   Residential real estate :   Any property used for residential purposes. Examples include single-family homes, condos, cooperatives, duplexes, townhouses, and multifamily residences.
 
 
   Commercial real estate :   Any property used exclusively for business purposes, such as apartment complexes, gas stations, grocery stores, hospitals, hotels, offices, parking facilities, restaurants, shopping centers, stores, and theaters.
 
 
   Industrial real estate :   Any property used for manufacturing, production, distribution, storage, and research and development.
 
 
   Land :   Includes  undeveloped property , vacant land, and agricultural lands such as farms, orchards, ranches, and timberland.
 
 
   Special purpose :   Property used by the public, such as cemeteries, government buildings, libraries, parks, places of worship, and schools.
 
 
    The Economics of Real Estate    
  Real estate is a critical driver of economic growth in the U.S.  Housing starts , the number of new residential construction projects in any given month, released by the U.S. Census Bureau, is a key economic indicator. The report includes building permits, housing starts, and housing completions data for single-family homes, homes with two to four units, and multifamily buildings with five or more units, such as apartment complexes. 1

"183-Day Rule: Definition, How It's Used for Residency, and Example","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the 183-Day Rule?    
  The 183-day rule refers to a threshold used by most countries to determine whether an individual should be considered a resident for tax purposes. This number is often used in a tax context because it marks the point at which someone has spent more than half the calendar year in a particular jurisdiction.
 
 
  In the U.S., the  Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) uses a formula to determine whether people who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should be considered residents for taxation. This is called the ""substantial presence test."" One of its criteria includes the question of whether an individual has spent 183 days in the U.S. based on a calculation that considers their combined physical presence in a given tax year and the two years prior. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 The 183-day rule refers to criteria used in many countries to determine tax residency of individuals. 
 In general, individuals are considered residents if they are physically present in a country for at least 183 days in a calendar year. 
 The U.S. Internal Revenue Service uses a more complicated formula, which considers both presence in a given year, as well as a fraction of presence in the two prior years. 
 The U.S. has  tax treaties  with other countries which concern what taxes individuals owe and to whom, as well as what exemptions may apply. 
 U.S. citizens and residents may exclude up to $126,500 of their foreign-earned income in 2024 if they meet the physical presence test for and paid taxes in a foreign country. 2 
 
 
    Understanding the 183-Day Rule    
  Many countries around the world use the 183-day threshold to broadly determine whether to tax someone as a resident, because it marks the majority of a year. These include Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, for example. Generally, this means that if you spent 183 days or more in the country during a given year, you are considered a  tax resident  for that year.
 
 
  Each nation maintaining a 183-day rule has its own criteria for applying it in practice. For example, some use the calendar year for the accounting period, whereas others use a fiscal year. Some include the day the person arrives in the country, others do not.
 
 
 
 
  Some countries have even lower thresholds that trigger tax residency. For example, Switzerland considers you a tax resident if you have spent more than 90 days there. 3

    The IRS and the 183-Day Rule    
  The IRS uses a more complicated formula to determine whether someone passes its substantial presence test, and is subject to U.S. taxes, as a result. The person in question must:
 
 
   Have been physically present for at least 31 days during the current year; and Be present for 183 days during the three-year period that includes the current year and the two years immediately preceding it. 
 
 
  The 183-day presence threshold is not based off a total sum of days present. Rather, it is calculated by adding the following:
 
 
   All of the days an individual was present during the current year One-third of the days they were present during the previous year One-sixth of the days they were present in the year before that 1 
 
 
    Other IRS Terms and Conditions    
  The IRS generally considers someone to have been present in the U.S. on a given day if they spent any part of a day there. But there are some exceptions.
 
 
  Days that do not count as days of presence include:
 
 
   Days that you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you do so regularly Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours while in transit between two other countries Days you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel Days you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are there Days in which you qualify as exempt, which includes foreign-government-related persons under an A or G visa, teachers and trainees under a J or Q visa; a student under an F, J, M, or Q visa; and a professional athlete competing for charity 1 
 
 
    U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens    
  Strictly speaking, the 183-day rule does not apply to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who are required to file tax returns regardless of their country of residence or the source of their income.
 
 
  However, such individuals may exclude at least part of their overseas earned income (up to $126,500 in 2024) from taxation provided they meet a physical presence test in a foreign country and paid taxes there. 2  To meet this physical presence test, the person needs to be present in the country for 330 complete days in 12 consecutive months. 4","By

    What Is a Straddle?    
  A straddle is a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying (long position) both a put option (leg one) and a call option (leg two) for the underlying security with the same  strike price  and the same  expiration date .
 
 
  A trader will profit from a long straddle when the price of the security rises or falls from the strike price by an amount more than the total cost of the  premium  paid. The profit potential is virtually unlimited on the call leg as long as the price of the underlying security moves very sharply. The profit on the put leg is capped at the difference between the strike price and zero less the premium paid.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A straddle is an options strategy that involves the purchase of both a put and a call option. Both options are purchased at the same expiration date and strike price on the same underlying securities. The strategy is only profitable when the stock either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total premium paid. A straddle implies what the expected volatility and trading range of a security may be by the expiration date. This strategy is most effective when considering heavily volatile investments. The premiums paid on multiple options may easily outweigh any potential profit without strong price movement.  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Zoe Hansen / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Straddles    
  Straddle strategies in finance refer to  two separate transactions  that both involve the same underlying security with the two corresponding transactions offsetting each other. Investors tend to employ a straddle when they anticipate a significant move in a stock’s price but they're unsure about whether the price will move up or down.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Julie Bang / Investopedia 
 
  A straddle can give a trader two significant clues about what the options market thinks of a stock. First is the  volatility  that the market is expecting from the security. Second is the expected trading range of the stock by the expiration date.
 
 
 
 
    How to Create a Straddle    
  A trader must add the price of the  put  and the call together to determine the cost of creating a straddle. They could create a straddle if they believe that a stock may rise or fall from its current price of $55 following the release of its latest earnings report on March 1. The trader would look to purchase one put and one call at the $55 strike with an expiration date of March 15.

  The trader would add the price of one March 15 $55  call  and one March 15 $55 put to determine the cost of creating the straddle. The total outlay or premium paid would be $5.00 for the two contracts x 100 = $500 (one contract consists of 100 shares) if both the calls and the puts trade for $2.50 each.
 
 
  The premium paid suggests that the stock would have to rise or fall by 9% from the $55 strike price to earn a profit by March 15. The amount that the stock is expected to rise or fall is a measure of its future expected volatility. Divide the premium paid by the strike price ($5 divided by $55, or 9%) to determine how much the stock has to rise or fall.
 
 
    Discovering the Predicted Trading Range    
  Options prices imply a predicted trading range. A trader can add or subtract the price of the straddle to or from the price of the stock to determine its expected trading range. The $5 premium could be added to $55 to predict a trading range of $50 to $60 in this case.
 
 
  The trader would lose some of their money but not necessarily all of it if the stock traded within the zone of $50 to $60. It's only possible to earn a profit if the stock rises or falls outside of the $50 to $60 zone at the time of expiration.
 
 
    Earning a Profit    
  The calls would be worth $0 and the puts would be worth $7 at expiration if the stock fell to $48. This would deliver a profit of $2 to the trader. But the calls would be worth $2 if the sto","0 seconds of 1 minute, 48 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straddle.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"What Is Turnover in Business, and Why Is It Important?","Definition 
 Turnover describes how quickly assets in a company are replaced within a specific period. 
    What Is Turnover?    
  Turnover is the pace that a company replaces assets within a certain period. It can include selling inventory, collecting receivables, or replacing employees. It can also represent the percentage of an investment portfolio that is replaced.
 
 
  Turnover might also mean something different, depending on the area you’re in. For instance, in Europe and Asia,  overall turnover  is a synonym for a company’s total  revenues .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The most common measures of corporate turnover look at accounts receivable and inventories. Accounts receivable turnover shows how quickly payments are being collected compared to credit sales during a set period. Inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory, showing how fast a company sells its inventory in a given period. In the investment industry, turnover is the percentage of a portfolio that is sold in a particular month or year. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A high turnover indicates strong sales performance and operational efficiency. 
 Zoe Hansen / Investopedia 
 
    Why Turnover Matters    
   Turnover ratios  calculate how quickly a business conducts operations. This measures efficiency and how well it is using its resources.
 
 
  Two of the largest assets owned by a business are usually accounts receivable and inventory, if any is kept. Both of these accounts require a significant cash investment, and it is important to measure how quickly a business collects cash. Turnover ratios are used by fundamental analysts and investors to assist them in determining if a company is managing its finances and assets correctly.
 
 
  Common types of turnover ratios include:
 
 
 
 
 
 Accounts receivable turnover 
 Inventory turnover 
 Portfolio turnover 
 Working capital turnover 
 
 
  Companies can better assess the efficiency of their operations by looking at a range of these ratios. Good turnover ratios can be high, midrange, or low, depending on what a company is measuring. For instance, a low accounts receivable turnover ratio means a company’s collection procedures or credit-issuing policies might need to be fixed. However, the same company might be a retailer with a high inventory turnover ratio, which can indicate strong sales.
 
 
    What Is Accounts Receivable Turnover?    
  Accounts receivable represents the total dollar amount of unpaid customer invoices at any point in time. Assuming that credit sales are sales not immediately paid in cash, the  accounts receivable turnover  formula is credit sales divided by average accounts receivable. The average  accounts receivable  is simply the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable balances for a particular period, such as a month or year.
 
 
  The accounts receivable turnover formula tells you how quickly you collect payments compared to your credit sales. For example, if credit sales for the month total $300,000 and the accounts receivable balance is $50,000, then the turnover rate is six. The goal is to maximize sales, minimize the receivable balance, and generate a large turnover rate.
 
 
   Important 
 Accounts payable turnover  (sales divided by average payables) is a short-term  liquidity  measure that measures the rate at which a company pays back its suppliers and vendors. 
 
 
 
    What Is Inventory Turnover?    
  The  inventory turnover  formula, which is stated as the  cost of goods sold (COGS)  divided by average inventory, is similar to the accounts receivable formula.
 
 
  When you sell inventory, the balance is moved to the cost of sales, which is an expense account. The goal as a business owner is to maximize the amount of  inventory  sold while minimizing the inventory that is kept on hand. For example, if the cost of sales for the month totals $400,000 and you carry $100,000 in inventory, your turnover rate is four, which indicates that you sold your entire inventory four times that month.
 
 
  Inventory turnover, also known as sales turnover, helps investors determine the level of risk that they will face if providing operating capital to a company. Retailers tend to have the  highest inventory turnover . The speed can be a factor of the industry in general or indicate a well-run company.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 The reciprocal of the inventory turnover ratio (1/inventory turnover) is the  days’ sales of inventory (DSI) . This tells you how many days it takes, on average, to completely sell and replace a company’s inventory. 
 
 
 
    What Is Portfolio Turnover?    
  Turnover is a term that is also used for investments. In this context, turnover measures the percentage of an investment portfolio that is sold in a set period.
 
 
  For instance, assume a  mutual fund  has $100 million in assets under management, and the portfolio manager sells $20 million in securities during the year. The rat",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/turnover.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

 Definition 
 A waiver of subrogation is a contract provision that prohibits an insurance company from seeking compensation from a negligent third party after paying a claim to the insured. 
    What Is a Waiver of Subrogation?    
  A waiver of subrogation is a contractual provision whereby an insured waives the right of their insurance carrier to seek redress or seek compensation for losses from a negligent third party. Typically,  insurers  charge an additional fee for a waiver of subrogation endorsement. Many construction contracts and leases include a  waiver of subrogation clause .
 
 
  Such provisions prevent one party’s insurance carrier from pursuing a claim against the other contractual party in an attempt to recover money paid by the insurance company to the insured or to a third party to resolve a covered claim.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A waiver of subrogation prevents an insurer from seeking recovery from a third party for damages paid. A waiver of subrogation clause provides additional protection for clients in most industries. Waivers of subrogation clauses minimize the potential for lawsuits arising from the loss that may occur during a construction project or other contractual agreement.  Insurance companies receive all of the funds that result from a subrogation process. Waivers of subrogation can prevent lengthy litigation and ruined business relationships. 
 
    Understanding a Waiver of Subrogation    
  A right of  subrogation  allows an insurer to stand in proxy for its insured after satisfying a claim paid to the insured per the company’s duties under the insurance policy. The insurance company may pursue a claim against other parties to cover its costs for that same loss, even when the loss involves a resolution of claims brought against the insured.
 
 
  In other words, if subrogation is waived, the insurance company cannot ""step into the client's shoes"" once a claim has been settled and sue the other party to recoup their losses. Thus, if subrogation is waived, the insurer is exposed to greater risk.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 Insurance companies frequently charge an additional fee on top of the premium to include a waiver of subrogation clause. Parties to the contract avoid litigation, and the insurance company bears the loss. 
 
 
 
    Types of Waiver of Subrogation    
  A waiver of subrogation is a provision that prohibits an insurer from pursuing a third party to recover damages for covered losses. Waivers of subrogation are found in various contracts, including construction contracts, leases, auto insurance policies, and more.
 
 
    Construction Contracts    
  Sometimes, construction contracts contain a waiver of subrogation clause. In these clauses, the owner waives all rights to sue third parties, such as contractors and subcontractors, for damages caused by perils covered in the owner's insurance policy. Under this provision, the owner's insurer also agrees that they will pay covered losses and will not seek to recoup these losses from the negligent party.
 
 
  The waiver of subrogation clauses has exceptions. If the owner's property insurance does not insure against a specific risk, the owner may seek recovery from the responsible party. Also, if the loss exceeds the insurance policy's limit, the owner may pursue the responsible party. 1 
 
 
    Landlord and Tenant Lease Agreements    
  Waiver of subrogation clauses in lease contracts function similarly. The insurer cannot stand in proxy for the owner to recover damages.

"Industrial Revolution: Definition, History, Pros, and Cons","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The Industrial Revolution took place during the late 1700s and early 1800s and was characterized by significant industrialization and innovation. 
    What Was the Industrial Revolution?    
  The Industrial Revolution was a period of major mechanization and innovation that began in Great Britain during the mid-18th and early 19th centuries and later spread throughout much of the world. The British Industrial Revolution was dominated by the exploitation of coal and iron.
 
 
  The American Industrial Revolution, sometimes referred to as the “Second Industrial Revolution,” began during the  Gilded Age  in the 1870s and continued through World War II. The era saw the mechanization of agriculture and manufacturing and the introduction of new modes of transportation, including steamships, the automobile, and airplanes.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The first Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the 1700s and 1800s and was a time of significant innovation. The American Industrial Revolution followed in the late 19th century and was an engine of economic growth in the U.S. The Industrial Revolution led to inventions that included the assembly line, telegraph, steam engine, sewing machine, and internal combustion engine. Working for businesses during the Industrial Revolution paid better wages than agricultural work. The increase in the number of factories and migration to the cities led to pollution, deplorable working and living conditions, and child labor. 
 
    How Did the Industrial Revolution Impact Society?    
  Although the Industrial Revolution began more than 200 years ago, it is a period that left a profound impact on how people lived and the way businesses operated. Arguably, the factory systems developed during the Industrial Revolution are responsible for creating capitalism and the modern cities of today.
 
 
  Before this period, most households subsisted on farming and lived primarily in small, rural communities. With the advent of factories during the 18th century, people began working for companies located in urban areas for the first time. Often the wages were low and conditions harsh. However, working for such businesses still paid a better living wage than farming. 1 
 
 
 
 
  Production efficiency improved during the Industrial Revolution with  inventions  such as the steam engine, which dramatically reduced the time it took to manufacture products. More efficient production subsequently reduced prices for products, primarily due to lower labor costs, opening the marketing doors to a new level of customers. 2

  The Industrial Revolution developed in conjunction with capitalist economies. Business owners (capitalists) began to organize labor centrally into factories and introduced a division of labor to increase output and profitability. Compared with the craft and guild systems that preceded it, capitalist production incentivized technological change and innovation at an unprecedented rate.
 
 
   Important 
 The Industrial Revolution was driven, in part, by the adoption of coal as an energy source. Before the use of coal, wood was the primary energy source; coal provided three times more energy than wood, and Britain had large coal deposits. 3 4 
 
 
 
    What Were the Effects of the Industrial Revolution on Tariffs?    
  The Industrial Revolution was not always organic or directed by free market forces alone. The United States government, for instance, helped domestic industry at the time by instituting  tariffs —taxes on foreign imported goods—so that products such as steel were cheaper than foreign imports. Cheaper steel prices encouraged the development of  infrastructure , such as railroads and bridges, during the American Industrial Revolution. 5 
 
 
    Advantages of Industrialization    
  The Industrial Revolution created an increase in employment opportunities.  Wages  at factories were higher than those earned as farmers. As factories became widespread, additional managers and employees were required to operate them, increasing the supply of jobs and overall wages.
 
 
  As most factories and large companies were located near cities, populations migrated to urban areas searching for jobs, often overwhelming the available housing supply. 6 
 
 
  This led to significant improvements in city planning.  Increased innovation disrupted the status quo , bringing new technologies to the masses and leading to higher levels of education. Such groundbreaking inventions, still used today, include the sewing machine, X-ray, lightbulb, calculator, and anesthesia.

The Correlation Coefficient: What It Is and What It Tells Investors,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Correlation Coefficient?    
  The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of a  linear relationship  between two variables. Its values can range from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of -1 describes a perfect  negative , or  inverse,  correlation, with values in one series rising as those in the other decline, and vice versa. A coefficient of 1 shows a perfect  positive correlation , or a direct relationship. A correlation coefficient of 0 means there is no linear relationship.
 
 
  Correlation coefficients are used in science and finance to assess the degree of association between two variables, factors, or data sets. For example, as high oil prices are favorable for crude producers, one might assume that the correlation between oil prices and forward returns on oil stocks is strongly positive. Calculating the  correlation  coefficient for these variables based on market data reveals a moderate and inconsistent correlation over lengthy periods. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Correlation coefficients are used to assess the strength of associations between data variables. The most common, called a “Pearson correlation coefficient,” measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Values always range from -1 for a perfectly inverse, or negative, relationship to 1 for a perfectly positive correlation.  Values at or close to zero indicate no linear relationship or a very weak correlation. The coefficient values required to signal a meaningful association depend on the application. The statistical significance of a correlation can be calculated from the correlation coefficient and the number of data points in the sample, assuming a normal population distribution. 
 
    Understanding the Correlation Coefficient    
  Different types of correlation coefficients are used to assess correlation based on the properties of the compared data. By far the most common is the  Pearson coefficient , known as “Pearson’s R , ”   which measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
 
 
  The Pearson coefficient uses a mathematical statistics formula to measure how closely the data points combining the two variables (with the values of one data series plotted on the x-axis and the corresponding values of the other series on the y-axis) approximate the  line of best fit . The line of best fit can be determined through regression analysis. 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 The Pearson coefficient, the most common correlation coefficient, cannot assess nonlinear associations between variables and or differentiate between dependent and independent variables. 
 
 
 
  The further the coefficient is from zero, whether it is positive or negative, the better the fit and the greater the correlation. The values of -1 (for a negative correlation) and 1 (for a positive one) describe perfect fits in which all data points align in a straight line, indicating that the variables are perfectly correlated.

  In other words, the relationship is so predictable that the value of one variable can be determined from the matched value of the other. The closer the correlation coefficient is to zero, the weaker the correlation, until at zero no linear relationship exists at all.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Hugo Lin 
 
  Assessments of correlation strength based on the correlation coefficient value vary by application. In physics and chemistry, a correlation coefficient should be lower than -0.9 or higher than 0.9 for the correlation to be considered meaningful, while in social sciences the threshold could be as high as -0.5 and as low as 0.5.
 
 
  For correlation coefficients derived from  sampling , the determination of statistical significance depends on the  p-value , which is calculated from the data sample’s size as well as the value of the coefficient. 
 
 
    Formula for the Correlation Coefficient    
  To calculate the Pearson correlation, start by determining each variable’s  standard deviation  as well as the  covariance  between them. The correlation coefficient is covariance divided by the product of the two variables’ standard deviations. 
 ρ x y = Cov ( x , y ) σ x σ y where: ρ x y = Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient Cov ( x , y ) = covariance of variables  x  and  y σ x = standard deviation of  x σ y = standard deviation of  y \begin{aligned} &\rho_{xy} = \frac { \text{Cov} ( x, y ) }{ \sigma_x \sigma_y } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\rho_{xy} = \text{Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient} \\ &\text{Cov} ( x, y ) = \text{covariance of variables } x \text{ and } y \\ &\sigma_x = \text","By

 Definition 
 Net asset value (NAV) is the difference between a company’s assets and its liabilities calculated at the end of each business day.   
    What Is Net Asset Value?    
  Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an investment fund that's determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. The fund's per-share NAV is then obtained by dividing NAV by the number of shares outstanding.
 
 
  Per-share NAV is most commonly used with a mutual fund or unit investment trusts. It's the price at which the shares of the funds registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) trade. NAV can change daily. Per-share NAV can therefore change as well.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 NAV is the value of an investment fund that's determined by subtracting liabilities from assets. 
 The per-share NAV is calculated by dividing the NAV by the number of shares outstanding. 
 NAV and per-share NAV are calculated for a  mutual fund  or a  unit investment trust . 
 NAV is calculated at the end of each business day using the closing market prices of the portfolio's securities.

    How Net Asset Value Works    
  The difference between assets and liabilities for companies and business entities is known as the net assets, the net worth, or the capital of the company. NAV is also applied to fund valuation and pricing.
 
 
  A fund’s per-share NAV makes pricing easy for investors to understand so it's used to value and conduct the buying and selling of a fund's shares. 1 
 
 
  NAV per individual share is often close to or equal to the book value per share of a business. Companies that are considered to have high growth prospects are traditionally valued more than NAV might suggest. Per-share NAV for closed-end funds is frequently compared to the stock price or market value per share to find undervalued or overvalued investments.

    NAV Formula    
  NAV = Assets - Liabilities
 
 
  NAV per share = (Assets - Liabilities) / Total number of outstanding shares
 
 
    NAV Example    
  Let's look at a calculation for the per-share NAV of a mutual fund. Assume that the fund has $100 million worth of investments in different securities, a figure that's calculated from the day's closing prices for each security.
 
 
  It also has $7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $4 million in total receivables, and accrued income for the day of $75,000. The fund has $13 million in short-term liabilities and $2 million in long-term liabilities. Accrued expenses for the day are $10,000.
 
 
  The fund has 5 million shares outstanding.
 
 
   1. To determine per-share NAV, first calculate the fund's NAV: 
 
 
  Total assets are:
 
 
  $100,000,000 + $7,000,000 + $4,000,000 + $75,000, or $111,075,000
 
 
  Total liabilities are:
 
 
  $13,000,000 + $2,000,000 + $10,000, or $15,010,000
 
 
   NAV = $111,075,000 - $15,010,000, or $96,065,000 
 
 
   2. Next, calculate per-share NAV: 
 
 
   Per-share NAV = $96,065,000 / 5,000,000, or $19.21 
 
 
   Important 
 The actual purchase price that investors pay for mutual fund shares would be the per-share NAV plus related fees such as sales loads. The amount they receive when redeeming shares would be the per-share NAV less related fees such as redemption fees. 1

    What Is a Value-Added Product?    
  A value-added product is a saleable commodity that has been enhanced with additional qualities that make it worth a higher price than the raw materials used to make it. It may be made more convenient, more attractive, more palatable, or easier to use than its raw ingredients.
 
 
  Adding value explains why businesses are able to sell their goods or services for more than they cost to produce.
 
 
  In marketing, the added value is a succinct message to the consumer about the characteristics that make a product worth more than its raw ingredients and, just as importantly, why it is preferable to similar products from competitors.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Value-added is the additional features or economic value that a company adds to its products and services before offering them to customers. Adding value to a product or service helps companies attract more customers, which can boost revenue and profits. Value-added is effectively the difference between a product's price to consumers and the cost of producing it. Value can be added in several different ways, such as adding a brand name to a generic product or assembling a product in an innovative way. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin 
 
    Understanding Value-Added    
  Value-added is the difference between the price of a product or service and the cost of producing it. The price is determined by what customers are willing to pay based on their  perceived value . Value is added or created in different ways.
 
 
  These may include, for instance, extra or special features added by a company or producer to increase the value of a product or service. The addition of value can thus increase the product's price that consumers are willing to pay. For example, offering a year of free tech support on a new computer would be a value-added feature. Individuals can also add value to services they perform, such as bringing advanced skills into the workforce.
 
 
 
 
  Consumers now have access to a whole range of products and services when they want them. As a result, companies constantly struggle to find  competitive advantages  over each other. Discovering what customers truly value is crucial for what the company produces, packages, markets, and how it delivers its products.
 
 
  Bose Corporation, as an example, has successfully shifted its focus from producing speakers to delivering a ""sound experience,"" or when a BMW car rolls off the  assembly line , it sells for a much higher premium over the cost of production because of its reputation for stellar performance, German engineering, and quality parts. Here, the additional advantage has been created through each brand's symbolic value and years of refinement.
 
 
    Value-Added in the Economy    
  The contribution of private industry or a government sector to overall  gross domestic product (GDP)  is the value-added of an industry, also referred to as GDP-by-industry. If all stages of production occurred within a country's borders, the total value added at all stages is what is counted in GDP.
 
 
  The total value added is the  market price  of the final product or service and only counts production within a specified time period. This is the basis on which  value-added tax (VAT)  is computed, a system of taxation that's prevalent in Europe.
 
 
  Economists can in this way determine how much value an industry contributes to a nation's GDP. Value-added in an industry refers to the difference between the total revenue of an industry and the total cost of inputs—the sum of labor, materials, and services—purchased from","0 seconds of 1 minute, 22 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueadded.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"Social Good: Definition, Benefits, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Social Good?    
  A social good is something that benefits the largest number of people in the largest possible way, such as clean air, clean water, healthcare, and literacy. Also known as ""common good,"" social good can trace its history to Ancient Greek philosophers and implies a positive impact on individuals or society in general. It also provides the basis for charity or  philanthropic  work.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 In recent times, social good is used to refer to corporate initiatives that aim to enhance the social contract of corporations by promoting practices that are better for the environment and overall society. Corporations gain employee trust and loyalty by providing them with a sense of purpose. Social media has become an important tool to promote social good. 
 
    Understanding Social Good    
  The capitalism-based definition of business states that companies exist only to provide the maximum possible return to  shareholders . This has often not run parallel to serving the common good in ways such as promoting clean air and water or financial independence for all citizens.
 
 
  As corporations focus more on corporate sustainability efforts and  social responsibility  in recognition of a de facto social contract with the public, their business models may expand to include more work to promote social good in their day-to-day strategies and operations.
 
 
    Social Good and Corporations    
  The decision of Microsoft founder  Bill Gates , the sixth-wealthiest person in the world (as of July 18, 2024), to allocate a significant sum of his wealth to solving some of the world's most intractable problems is an example of work benefiting the social good. 1 2  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation runs programs to alleviate and cure diseases such as HIV, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, and more in developing countries.
 
 
  Corporations keen to promote an image of themselves as socially conscious and responsible have created programs that seek to highlight their work toward social good. Aside from the positive feelings such programs generate, doing work that benefits the social good can give a company a sense of purpose and passion.
 
 
  That can help with  productivity , innovation, and growth, as employees who believe in their company's mission tend to invest more of their effort and passion into their work. Working toward a social good also has the effect of building bonds with the community. In helping a community or group of people, a company may hope that their effort is rewarded with sales.
 
 
 
 
  Corporate investment in the social good can also help a company build and maintain its  brand  and its  identity , as well as loyalty. A good example of this is the Newman's Own brand, which discloses clearly on its label, ""100% Profits to Help Kids."" The company's own foundation is dedicated to feeding children with serious illnesses, indigenous food justice, nutrition education and school food. 3 4 
 
 
    Social Good and Social Media    
  Increasingly, social good has been connected with social media in that its definition has expanded to include a shareable deed or sentiment.  Social media platforms  are becoming a part of the social good because they are an efficient way to educate the public, and advocate and fundraise for programs that support the social good. It also means that individuals, not just governments, corporations, or charities, can advocate for social good.
 
 
  Aristotle described the common good as ""proper to, and attainable only by, the community, yet individually shared by its members."" 5 
 
 
    Example of Social Good    
  As climate change becomes a mainstream issue, oil companies have increasingly come in for criticism due to their role in polluting the atmosphere. Many responded by creating separate divisions to promote their environmental image. For example, Total, France's biggest petroleum major, reportedly allocated 4.3% of its budget to investing in renewable energy technologies from 2010 to 2018.
 
 
  Meanwhile, according to the same report, Equinor, Norway's biggest  publicly traded  energy company, plans to spend between 15% and 20% of its budget on renewable energy by 2030. Plenty of other big oil companies, including British Petroleum, are also investing heavily in renewable energy ventures. 6

What Is Rational Choice Theory?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Rational choice theory assumes that individuals make informed decisions instead of random choices. 
    What Is Rational Choice Theory?    
  Rational choice theory states that individuals seek to achieve outcomes aligned with their objectives to maximize their  self-interest . When limited options are available, individuals choose the path that provides the greatest benefit and satisfaction.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Adam Smith was one of the first economists to develop the underlying principles of rational choice theory. Rational choice theory is often associated with the concepts of rational actors and the invisible hand. Many economists believe that rational choice theory benefits the economy as a whole. 
 
    Self-Interest and the Invisible Hand    
  Adam Smith was one of the first economists to develop the underlying principles of rational choice theory. In his book,  "" An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations "",  published in 1776,  Adam Smith  introduces the idea of the invisible hand. The  invisible hand  is a metaphor for the unseen forces influencing a free-market economy. 1 
 
 
  The invisible hand theory assumes self-interest. Both this theory and further developments in rational choice theory refute any negative misconceptions associated with self-interest. Instead, these concepts suggest that rational actors acting with their self-interest in mind can create benefits for the economy at large.
 
 
  Through the freedom of production, as well as consumption, the best interests of society are fulfilled. The constant interplay of individual pressures on market  supply and demand  causes the natural movement of prices and trade. Economists who believe in the invisible hand theory lobby for less government intervention and more free-market exchange opportunities. 2 
 
 
    Collective Behavior    
  Rational actors are the individuals in an economy who make choices based on calculations and available information. Rational choice theory assumes that individuals, or rational actors, maximize their advantage in any situation and consistently try to minimize their losses. Economists may use this assumption of rationality as part of broader studies to understand certain behaviors of society as a whole. Like all theories, rational choice theory may explain collective behavior.

  Rational choice theory also helps to explain behavior that seems irrational. Dissenters have pointed out that individuals do not always make rational, utility-maximizing decisions based on  behavioral economics , which explains the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions.
 
 
  Economist Richard Thaler highlighted the limitations of the assumption that humans operate as rational actors. Thaler’s idea of  mental accounting  shows how people place greater value on some dollars than others, even though all dollars have the same value. 3  They might drive to another store to save $10 on a $20 purchase, but they would not drive to another store to save $10 on a $1,000 purchase.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Rational choice theory can help determine buying patterns, prices, demand, and supply when consumers make purchases based on  utility  or the satisfaction a product or service provides. 
 
 
 
    Critics of Rational Choice    
  Critics of rational choice theory say that, in an ideal world, people always make optimal decisions that provide them with the greatest benefit and satisfaction. However, people are often moved by emotions and external factors.
 
 
  Nobel laureate  Herbert Simon , who rejected the assumption of perfect rationality in mainstream economics, proposed the theory of bounded rationality instead. This theory says people cannot obtain all the necessary information to make the best possible decision.
 
 
  Simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives, or all consequences that follow from each alternative, is realistically impossible for most decisions. 4

 Definition 
 A partnership is a formal business arrangement between two or more individuals who agree to manage and operate a business together while sharing its profits and liabilities. 
    What Is a Partnership?    
  A partnership is a formal arrangement by two or more parties to manage and operate a business and share its profits.
 
 
  There are several types of partnership arrangements. In a general partnership, all partners share liabilities and profits equally. In other types of partnerships, profits may be shared in different percentages or some partners may have  limited liability . Partnerships may also have a ""silent partner,"" in which one party is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.
 
 
  The type of partnership that business partners choose will depend on how they want to manage day-to-day operations, who is willing to be financially liable for the business, and how they want to pay taxes.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A partnership is an arrangement between two or more people to oversee business operations and share its profits and liabilities. In a general partnership company, all members share both profits and liabilities. In other partnership structures, some partners may share a smaller percentage of the profits but not assume any liability for the business. Professionals like doctors and lawyers often form a limited liability partnership. There may be tax benefits to forming a partnership instead of a corporation. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Matthew Collins 
 
    Types of Partnerships    
  In a broad sense, a partnership can be any endeavor undertaken jointly by multiple parties. The parties may be governments, nonprofits enterprises, businesses, or private individuals. The goals of a partnership also vary widely.
 
 
 
 
  Within the narrow sense of a for-profit business undertaken by two or more individuals, there are three main categories of partnership:  general partnership , limited partnership, and limited liability partnership.
 
 
    General Partnership    
  In a general partnership, all parties share legal and financial liability equally. The individuals are personally responsible for the debts the partnership takes on. Profits are also shared equally. The specifics of profit sharing should be laid out in writing in a partnership agreement.
 
 
   Important 
 When drafting a partnership agreement, an expulsion clause should be included, detailing what events are grounds for expelling a partner. 
 
 
 
    Limited Liability Partnership    
   Limited liability partnerships  (LLPs) are a common structure for professionals, such as accountants, lawyers, and architects. This arrangement limits partners' personal liability so that, for example, if one partner is sued for malpractice, the assets of other partners are not at risk. 1 
 
 
  Some law and accounting firms make a further distinction between equity partners and salaried partners. The latter is more senior than associates but does not have an ownership stake. They are generally paid bonuses based on the firm's profits.
 
 
    Limited Partnership    
  Limited partnerships are a hybrid of general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. At least one partner must be a general partner, with full personal liability for the partnership's debts. At least one other is a silent partner whose liability is limited to the amount invested. This silent partner generally does not participate in the management or day-to-day operation of the partnership. 1

West Coast vs. East Coast Economy: Which Is Bigger?,"Close 
 
 
 
    West Coast vs. East Coast Economy: An Overview    
  If California was a nation, it would be the world's fifth-largest economy, edging out Great Britain. 1 2  The state's  gross domestic product  was an estimated $3.1 trillion in 2019, a growth of $162 billion from a year before. It experienced a slight drop in 2020 to $3 trillion but rebounded to almost $3.4 trillion by the end of 2021. 3 
 
 
  In an East-West comparison, it depends on the choice of comparisons. The New York City region alone is much smaller at over $1.8 trillion in 2021. 4  But count in just the two next-biggest economies on the East Coast and the figures for the East Coast are roughly equal to those for the West Coast. 5 
 
 
    The West Coast Economy    
  California is a triple threat economically. The technology sector is centered in  San Francisco  and the surrounding region, now known as Silicon Valley. 6  The entertainment industry works out of Los Angeles. 7  And the Central Valley harvests fruits and vegetables. 8 
 
 
  But don't forget the wine industry. California wine sales in the U.S. alone sailed above $45 billion in 2021, a 14% increase from the previous year. 9 
 
 
  On top of that, California has seen a surge in  growth attributed to the financial services industry  and upwards pressure on real estate prices. Both have seen strong growth of at least 6% from 2013 to 2018. Out of all the states, California ranks fourth in gross state product growth. 10 
 
 
  The West Coast has at least one other big advantage: It's the gateway to international trade. California and Washington both have major ports for trade between the U.S. and Asia that support the exchange of goods, dominated by American agricultural products and Asian manufactured products. 11 12 13  As Asian economies continue to develop and participate more in the global economy, these ports have become increasingly integral to the world economy.
 
 
   $45.6 billion 
 Total California wine sales in the U.S. in 2021. 9 
 
  Any consideration of the  West Coast economy  should not leave out Oregon and Washington state. Both were ranked among the top half of the states nationally in GDP growth in 2021. 14 
 
 
  The Pacific Northwest has become a center of technological innovation as the headquarters of Microsoft and Amazon as well as other businesses including retailers Costco and Starbucks. 15 
 
 
 
 
    The East Coast Economy    
  If we're going to compare apples to apples, let's first take a look at California versus New York State.
 
 
  New York State's GDP in 2021 was $1.9 trillion, far smaller than California's $3.4 trillion and roughly comparable to the economy of Canada. 16 3 4 
 
 
  However, given New York City's vast sprawl across several states, it might be more reasonable to consider the New York metropolitan area as compared to California. The New York metro region had a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of almost $2 trillion in 2021, according to the United States Conference of Mayors, with the prediction to grow to an estimated $2.3 trillion by 2023. 17 
 
 
   Important 
 Tennessee (8.6%) and New Hampshire (8.5%) are the fastest-growing states by GDP growth while Nevada (7.1%) and Indiana (6.9%) are growing as fast as California, at 7.8%. 14 
 
 
 
  But in terms of East Coast economies, that omits the Philadelphia area, at about $478 billion, and the Boston area, at about $527 billion. Those three regions alone roughly equal California's economy, while leaving out a number of smaller but not insignificant cities. 17 
 
 
  New York City is, of course, the financial capital of the U.S., if not the world, and has significant stakes in media, publishing, and new technology. Even though finance accounts for 90% of the jobs, there is only 5.2% of growth expected from 2018-2028. The  New York City industries  with the most expected growth over the projected decade are ambulatory health care services (65.6%), warehousing and storage (56.4%), and other information services (52.5%). 18 
 
 
  Topping it off, many of America’s global corporate giants are headquartered in the New York City area, including Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, Pfizer, Citigroup, and MetLife. 19 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 California's gross domestic product was almost $3.4 trillion in 2021. The East Coast's total was roughly the same when the three biggest metro areas are combined. Increasingly, the biggest companies have a strong presence on both coasts. 
 
    Special Considerations on West and East    
  The West Coast versus East Coast question may not be relevant much longer.
 
 
  Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are headquartered in San Francisco, but Google has 12,000 employees at its offices in New York City, as of 2021. 20 21  California has Silicon Valley, but new media companies like Vice Media, Snapchat, and BuzzFeed operate offices out of New York, as do many traditional print media companies that have transitioned to the internet. 22 23 24

 The 4 Ps of marketing are product, price, place, and promotion which are essential elements for successfully marketing a product or service. 
    What Are the 4 Ps of Marketing?    
  The four Ps or marketing are a “marketing mix” comprised of four key elements—product, price, place, and promotion.
 
 
  These are the key factors that are involved in introducing a product or service to the public. Often referred to as a  marketing mix , they provide a framework that companies can use to successfully market a product or service to consumers. Since the four Ps were introduced in the 1950s, more Ps have been added to the mix, including people, process, and physical evidence.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The four Ps are the four essential factors involved in marketing a product or service to the public. The four Ps are product, price, place, and promotion. The concept of the four Ps has been around since the 1950s. As the marketing industry has evolved, other Ps have been identified: people, process, and physical evidence. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Understanding the 4 Ps of Marketing    
  Neil Borden, an advertising professor at Harvard, popularized the idea of the marketing mix—and the concepts that would later be known primarily as the four Ps—in the 1950s. His 1964 article ""The Concept of the Marketing Mix"" demonstrated the ways that companies could use advertising tactics to engage their consumers. 1 
 
 
  Decades later, the concepts that Borden popularized are still being used by companies to advertise their goods and services.
 
 
  Borden's ideas were developed and refined over a number of years by other key players in the industry. E. Jerome McCarthy, a marketing professor at Michigan State University, refined the concepts in Borden's article and named them the ""four Ps"" of marketing. McCarthy co-wrote the book  Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach , further popularizing the idea. 2

  At the time the concept was introduced, it helped companies breach the physical barriers that could hamper widespread product adoption. Today, the Internet has helped businesses to overcome some of these barriers.
 
 
  People, process, and physical evidence are extensions of the original Four Ps and are relevant to current trends in marketing.
 
 
   Tip 
 Any successful marketing strategy should be revisited from time to time. The marketing mix you create is not intended to be static. It needs to be adjusted and refined as your product grows and your  customer base changes . 
 
 
 
    1. Product    
  Creating a marketing campaign starts with an understanding of the product itself. Who needs it and why? What does it do that no competitor's product can do? Perhaps it's a new thing altogether and is so compelling in its design or function that consumers will have to have it when they see it.
 
 
  The job of the marketer is to define the product and its qualities and introduce it to the consumer—the basic marketing of a product (or service).
 
 
  Defining the product also is key to its distribution.  Marketers  need to understand the  life cycle of a product , and business executives need to have a plan for dealing with products at every stage of the life cycle.

"Hard Skills: Definition, Examples, and Comparison with Soft Skills","Close 
 
 
 
    What Are Hard Skills?    
  Hard skills are technical skills required for a job. They are learned abilities acquired and enhanced through education and experience. Hard skills are important for your resume, as employers look for them when hiring.
 
 
  Hard skills alone don’t translate into success, as employees also need other skills, such as  soft skills . Unlike soft skills, hard skills can be quantified. For example, a hard skill might be proficiency in a second language, while a soft skill could be the ability to work well on a team.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Hard skills are technical skills required for a job. Hard skills are acquired through education and experience. Soft skills are behavioral, such as being a team player. Unlike soft skills, hard skills can be easily quantified. Employers typically look for a combination of hard and soft skills. 
 
    Understanding Hard Skills    
  Hard skills are  technical skills needed to perform a job  or land a new one. They are typically industry-specific. For example, a financial analyst would need a different set of hard skills from a carpenter. However, hard skills can also be valuable across industries. For example, fluency in a second language could potentially benefit both the analyst and the carpenter.
 
 
  Employers and recruiters look for hard skills listed on your resume and during the interview process. It’s best to back up your hard skills with a certificate, degree, or other qualification that shows a level of achievement.
 
 
  Experience is also seen as a qualification that validates expertise in hard skills. Some prospective employers test the hard skills of job candidates. Someone interviewing for an editing job, for example, might have to take an editing test.
 
 
  Hard skills focus on practical abilities and skills, whereas soft skills focus on behaviors and personalities, such as social and communication skills. Soft skills are less tangible and harder to teach.
 
 
  Employers typically look for a hybrid of hard and soft skills. Soft skills are more intrinsic to personality and difficult to judge quickly, but they may be as important on the job over time.
 
 
   Important 
 Hard and soft skills are critical for success at almost any job, and having both on your resume is essential when job hunting. 
 
 
 
    Types of Hard Skills    
  The types of hard skills needed to be qualified and successful in a job depend on the industry. Employers typically list the hard skills required in job descriptions.
 
 
 
 
    Common Hard Skills    
 
 Computer software knowledge 
 Graphic design 
 Data analysis 
 Project management 
 Marketing 
 Copywriting 
 Computer programming 
 Foreign languages 
 Search engine optimization (SEO) 
 
 
    Top Hard Skills    
  According to LinkedIn, the top hard skills are: 1 
 
 
 
 Customer service 
 Sales 
 Accounting 
 Business development 
 Marketing 
 Digital marketing 
 Sales management 
 Finance 
 Social media

 Structured query language (SQL) 
 
 
    Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills    
  Hard skills generally have rules that remain the same regardless of the business, industry, or even culture in which they are practiced. The rules of soft skills can change  depending on company culture  and the expectations of colleagues.
 
 
  For example, the rules for how a  programmer creates code  are the same regardless of where the programmer works. However, a programmer may communicate effectively with other programmers about technical details but struggle when communicating with senior managers about a project’s progress or support needs.
 
 
  Hard skills can be learned via education, training, or apprenticeships, and on the job. The levels of competency can be defined, and there is a direct path to achieving them. For example, in the field of accounting, you can take basic and advanced accounting courses, earn a degree, gain work experience, and pass the  certified public accountant (CPA) exam .
 
 
  Soft skills are not often found in the curriculum of a school or college. However, they are taught in programs that help people develop communication skills, teamwork, or people management skills. Some common soft skills include:
 
 
   Communication Teamwork Adaptability Problem solving Conflict resolution 
 
 
   Note 
 Ask your employer if they offer or pay for any leadership training or team-building programs for employees. If your employer wants you to improve one of your hard or soft skills, many companies will cover hard- and soft-skill programs for their employees. 
 
    Example of Hard Skills    
  Accounting is a profession that requires a relatively rigid set of hard skills. Proficiency in the Microsoft Office suite, especially Excel, is a given. Familiarity with  industry-specific software , such as tax preparation software and Intuit’s QuickBooks, is also required.

 Definition 
 Return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated by dividing net operating profit after tax by invested capital. 
    What Is Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)?    
  Return on invested capital (ROIC) shows how efficiently a company uses its capital to generate profits. Comparing a company’s ROIC with its  weighted average cost of capital  (WACC) reveals whether the company's  invested capital  is used effectively.
 
 
  Besides ROIC, businesses use other metrics to assess how well the company uses capital, including  economic value added  and  return on capital employed .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Invested capital is the money raised by a company by issuing securities to equity shareholders and debt to bondholders.  Analysts and investors can compare a company's ROIC with entities in the same sector. A company creates value when ROIC exceeds its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Dennis Madamba / Investopedia 
 
    Formula and Calculation of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)    
  The formula for ROIC is: 
 ROIC = NOPAT Invested Capital where: NOPAT = Net operating profit after tax \begin{aligned} &\text{ROIC} = \frac{ \text{NOPAT} }{ \text{Invested Capital} } \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{NOPAT} = \text{Net operating profit after tax} \\ \end{aligned} ​ ROIC = Invested Capital NOPAT ​ where: NOPAT = Net operating profit after tax ​ 
 Written another way, ROIC = (net income – dividends) / (debt + equity). The ROIC formula is calculated by assessing the value in the denominator, total capital, the sum of a company’s debt and equity. 
 There are several ways to calculate this value. One is to subtract cash and non-interest-bearing current liabilities(NIBCL)—including tax liabilities and accounts payable, as long as these are not subject to interest or fees—from total assets. 
 Another method of calculating invested capital is to add the book value of a company’s equity to the book value of its debt and then subtract non-operating assets, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and assets of discontinued operations. 
 Yet another way to calculate invested capital is to obtain the working capital figure by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Next, you obtain non-cash working capital by subtracting cash from the working capital value you just calculated. Finally, non-cash working capital is added to a company’s fixed assets.
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 ROIC higher than the cost of capital means a company is healthy and growing, while ROIC lower than the cost of capital suggests an unsustainable business model. 
 
 
 
  The value in the numerator can also be calculated in several ways. The most straightforward way is to subtract dividends from a company’s net income.

  On the other hand, because a company may have benefited from a one-time source of income unrelated to its core business—a windfall from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, for example—it is often preferable to look at net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). NOPAT is calculated by adjusting the operating profit for taxes:
 
 
  NOPAT = (operating profit) × (1 – effective tax rate)

  Capital expenditures (CapEx) are the funds companies allocate to acquire, upgrade, and maintain essential physical assets like property, technology, or equipment, crucial for expanding operational capacity and securing long-term economic benefits. By investing in fixed assets, such as building a new factory or upgrading technology, companies aim to enhance their operations, ensuring sustained growth and competitive advantage. CapEx decisions reflect strategic intent, positioning businesses to  leverage new opportunities  and optimize their physical infrastructure.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Capital expenditures (CapEx) are funds companies use to acquire, upgrade, or maintain physical assets like buildings, technology, or equipment, with the goal of increasing operational scope or future economic benefits. CapEx is listed as an investment on a company's balance sheet and can be calculated by adding current depreciation to the change in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). Industries that are capital-intensive, such as oil, telecommunications, and manufacturing, tend to have higher levels of CapEx due to the substantial investment in fixed assets required for maintenance and growth. CapEx differs from operating expenses (OpEx) as it involves longer-term investments and is capitalized on the balance sheet, whereas OpEx are short-term recurring expenses that are fully tax-deductible in the year they occur. The cash flow-to-capital-expenditures (CF-to-CapEx) ratio measures a company's ability to generate enough cash flow from its operations to fund its asset acquisitions, where a ratio above 1.0 indicates sufficient cash flow. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Laura Porter 
 
    Understanding Capital Expenditures (CapEx)    
  CapEx can tell you how much a company invests in existing and new fixed assets to maintain or grow its business. It's any type of expense that a company capitalizes or shows on its balance sheet as an investment rather than on its income statement as an expenditure. Capitalizing an asset requires that the company spread the cost of the expenditure over the useful life of the asset.
 
 
  A company's industry influences the amount of CapEx it requires. Some of the most capital-intensive industries have the highest levels of capital expenditures. They include oil exploration and production, telecommunications, manufacturing, and utility industries.
 
 
  You can find CapEx in the investing activities section of a company's cash flow statement. Companies can highlight CapEx in various ways. It may be listed as capital spending,  PP&E purchases , or acquisition expenses.
 
 
 
 
  You can also calculate capital expenditures using data from a company's income statement and balance sheet. Find the amount of  depreciation  expense recorded for the current period on the income statement. Locate the current period's property, plant, and equipment line-item balance on the balance sheet.

Overheated Economy: Factors That Contribute,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 An overheated economy is defined by rapid growth and high inflation, often resulting from excessive consumer spending and low unemployment rates that exceed sustainable levels. 
    What Is an Overheated Economy?    
  An overheated economy is one that has experienced a prolonged period of good  economic growth  and activity that has led to high levels of  inflation , triggered by increased consumer wealth.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An overheating economy is an economy that is expanding at an unsustainable rate. The two main signs of an overheating economy are rising rates of inflation and an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for an economy. Causes of an overheating economy range from external economic shocks to asset bubbles. 
 
    Understanding an Overheated Economy    
  A sharp rise in prices causes inefficient supply allocations as producers overproduce and create excess production capacity in an attempt to  capitalize  on the high levels of wealth. Unfortunately, these inefficiencies and inflation will eventually hinder the economy's growth and can often be a precursor to a  recession .
 
 
  Simply put, an overheated economy is one that is expanding at a rate that is unsustainable. There are two main signs of an overheating economy—rising rates of inflation and an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for an economy.
 
 
    Rising Rates of Inflation    
  Rising inflation is typically one of the first signs that an economy is overheating. As a result, governments and  central banks  will usually raise interest rates in an attempt to lower the amount of spending and borrowing. While central banks can combat rising inflation through interest rate increases, they can often come too late. Because inflation is a lagging indicator, it can take a while for changes in policy to reduce the rate. 
 
 
 
 
  Between June 2004 and June 2006, the  Federal Reserve Board (FRB)  increased the interest rate 17 times as a gradual means of slowing America's overheated economy. 1  However, two years later, U.S. inflation hit 5.6 percent, a cycle high. This rapid rise in prices was followed by a crippling recession, which saw inflation plunge below zero within six months. 2 
 
 
    Abnormally High Employment Rates    
  The second sign of an overheating economy is an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for a country.  Full employment  should be a good thing. But full employment also means higher inflation since everyone has a job (meaning productivity is at an all-time high) and money to spend.
 
 
  Since World War II, the unemployment rate generally fell below 5% in the years immediately preceding recessions. That includes the years leading up to the  Great Recession . 3 
 
 
   Important 
 Other characteristics of overheated economies include abnormally high levels of consumer confidence followed by a sharp reversal.  
 
 
 
    Causes of an Overheating Economy    
  The two main signs outlined above are also causes of an overheating economy. Other causes of an overheating economy include  asset bubbles  and external economic shocks. An example of the latter are the oil shocks that occurred during much of the 1970s and 1980s. They resulted in recessions of varying periods and intensity as America's oil  import  bill grew to meet increased demand for gasoline. 4 5 
 
 
  Asset bubbles are an unsustainable increase in prices for certain assets. This is a sign of overheating. The bursting of the  dotcom bubble  in 2001 resulted in a recession. More recently, the 2008 financial crisis was the result of a bubble in real estate mortgages. The bubble had wide-reaching implications across geographies and resulted in a prolonged recession that spanned multiple geographies.
 
 
    Examples of an Overheating Economy    
  The Great Recession during the late 2000s was preceded by an overheating economy. The unemployment rate continuously fell until 2007, culminating at a rate of 4.6% (below the normal rate) in that year. 3  Meanwhile, the interest rate, which had been steadily rising, peaked at 5.25% in 2006, when  Ben Bernanke  became the Fed Chair and right before the crisis. 1  Inflation also peaked at 4.3% at the same time. 2 
 
 
  Another sign of a U.S. economy that was overheating was the real estate asset bubble that burst in 2007 and sent shock waves through the entire U.S. financial ecosystem. Compounding these problems was the government's spending. During President Clinton's years, the federal budget had a surplus. 6  However, President Bush's tax cuts converted that surplus into a deficit. 7 
 
 
  In 2005, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that there would be a budget deficit of $368 billion that year and it would be followed by a deficit of $295 billion the next year. In short, the U.S. economy demonstrated the hallmarks of an overheating economy in the years leading up to the recession. 8

Liquidity Coverage Ratio: Definition and How To Calculate,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Mandated by the Basel Accords, the liquidity coverage ratio is the amount of liquid assets that financial institutions must have on hand to ensure they can meet their short-term obligations in the event of market turmoil. 
  Just like you might keep aside money for three to six months of expenses in case of unexpected emergencies, banks must maintain a stockpile of easily accessible assets to weather financial storms. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, was proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a group of central bankers and regulators from the world's major financial centers.
 
 
  ""The goal is to ensure that banks hold enough highly liquid assets to cover outflows of cash during a crisis,"" Laurence Ball, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, told Investopedia. ""The 2008 crises at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, etc., occurred because they ran out of cash due to a number of liquidity drains.""  
 
 
  These events led regulators to require banks to hold enough cash-like assets to survive 30 days of market chaos. The international standard, implemented in the U.S. by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2014, is one of the most significant reforms to emerge from the global financial crisis. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) acts as banks' financial safety net, requiring them to maintain enough easily sellable assets to cover 30 days of withdrawals and obligations. The ratio helps protect everyday depositors by ensuring banks can handle sudden market disruptions or customer panic without freezing up. Not all assets count equally—regulators rank them in three tiers based on how quickly they can be converted to cash. While designed to prevent another 2008-style meltdown, the LCR's effectiveness has been called into question by bank runs and other crises since then. 
 
    What Is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?    
  The LCR is a result of updates to the  Basel Accords , regulations created by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 3  The rule is designed to be a stress test that banks must pass every day, not just to protect the bank itself but also the financial and economic actors that rely on it.
 
 
 
 
  The LCR requires financial institutions to maintain a precise mix of assets that can be quickly turned into cash—think Treasury bonds, not long-term loans or real estate—to tide them over for 30 days. 4  These assets are ranked in three tiers based on how easy they would be to use in a crisis.

  Level 1 assets are counted at full value. These include cash, central  bank reserves , and government securities that markets will always want to buy. Level 2A assets are high-quality but less liquid, so they get a 15% haircut when banks count them. Level 2B assets include corporate stocks and bonds, and banks can only count 50%-75% of their value toward their LCR. 5 
 
 
  The 30-day survival period wasn't chosen randomly. It's based on historical patterns of how financial crises unfold. Most banks that survived past crises managed to hold on for about a month before government intervention turned the tide. 6 
 
 
  Since implementation, many researchers have said these changes aren't enough. ""The requirement for liquidity in the LCR is based on a stress test that understates the likely outflows of cash in a crisis,"" Ball said.
 
 
  Ball's research shows the rules may underestimate three important components of how banks would stay liquid in a crisis: how much money regular customers might withdraw, how much short-term funding from other banks might disappear, and how much cash banks might need to post as collateral for their financial contracts. 7  As such, he argued, ""The big U.S. banks are at risk of liquidity crises that threaten their survival even if they comply with the LCR rule.""

 In 2019, the Trump administration changed U.S. LCR requirements to cut compliance costs for midsized banks, act on industry arguments that smaller regional banks posed less systemic risk than global giants, and carry out the so-called  Crapo Bill  (Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018), which directed regulators to adjust requirements based on bank size and complexity. 8 
 
 
 
    2019 Changes To the LCR

 Definition 
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is an independent federal agency tasked with protecting investors and maintaining fair and efficient markets. 
    What Is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?    
  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the federal agency that oversees investment offerings and financial markets. It is responsible for regulating  broker-dealers ,  investment advisors ,  exchanges , and public companies to ensure that investors have accurate and transparent information. It also regulates the sale of securities, including  initial public offerings .
 
 
  Congress created the SEC in 1934 in response to the Great Depression. As the first federal regulator of the securities markets, the SEC was tasked with regulating the  bucket shops  and unethical trading practices that had contributed to the stock market crash of 1929.
 
 
  Securities offered in the U.S. must be registered with the SEC before being sold to investors. Financial services firms such as broker-dealers, advisory firms, asset managers, and their professional representatives must also register with the SEC to do business.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and protecting investors. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the SEC, mainly in response to the stock market crash of 1929 in the leadup to the Great Depression. The SEC is responsible for regulating financial markets and approving securities for sale to the public. The SEC brings civil action against those it alleges broke securities laws or regulations. The SEC also refers criminal cases to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

    How the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Works    
  The SEC oversees organizations and individuals in the securities markets, including securities exchanges, brokerage firms, dealers,  registered investment advisors , and investment funds. Through established securities rules and regulations, the SEC promotes disclosure and sharing of market-related information, fair dealing, and protection against fraud. It provides investors access to registration statements, periodic financial reports, and other securities forms through its electronic data-gathering, analysis, and retrieval database, better known as  EDGAR . 1 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 The SEC was created in 1934 to help restore investor confidence in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash. 2 
 
 
 
  The SEC is headed by five commissioners appointed by the president, one of whom is the chair. The commissioners have a five-year term, but may serve an additional 18 months until a replacement is found. Present SEC chair Paul Atkins took office in April 2025. 3  The law requires that no more than three of the five commissioners come from the same political party to promote nonpartisanship. 4 3

What Is Deferred Compensation?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Deferred Compensation?    
  Deferred compensation is part of an employee's regular compensation that is set aside to be paid at a later date, usually at  retirement . In many cases, taxes on this income are deferred (postponed) until it is paid out. There are many forms of deferred compensation, including  retirement plans ,  pension plans , and  stock-option  plans.
 
 
  There are qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. While qualified deferred compensation plans are available to many employees,  non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plans  cater mainly to  high-income earners  who want to put away funds for retirement and find the company  401(k) plan  inadequate for their needs.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Employers use deferred compensation plans to incentivize prospective and current employees. Deferred compensation can be structured as either qualified or non-qualified under federal regulations. Some deferred compensation is made available only to top employees, such as executives. A risk of deferred compensation in a non-qualified plan is that the employee can lose the money if the company goes bankrupt. 1 
 
    How Deferred Compensation Works    
  An employee may negotiate for deferred compensation because it offers immediate tax benefits. In many cases, the taxes due on the income is deferred until the compensation is paid out, often when the employee reaches retirement age. 2 3  If employees expect to be in a lower  tax bracket  when retiring, they have a chance to reduce their tax burden.
 
 
   Roth 401(k) s are an exception, as they require the employee to pay taxes on income as it is earned. The balance in a Roth account is, however, normally tax-free when it is withdrawn. 4  It can be a better option for people who expect to be in a higher tax bracket when they retire.
 
 
    Types of Deferred Compensation    
  There are two broad categories of deferred compensation: qualified and non-qualified. These differ in their legal treatment and the purpose they serve.

    Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans    
  Qualified deferred compensation plans are governed by the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) , a key set of federal regulations for retirement plans. 5  They include 401(k) plans and many  403(b) plans . 6 7 
 
 
 
 
  Funds in qualified deferred compensation plans are for the sole benefit of their recipients. Creditors cannot access the funds if the company goes  bankrupt . Contributions to the plans are capped by law. 8 
 
 
    Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans    
  Non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plans are contractual agreements between employers and participants. Also known as  409(a) plans  or, in some cases,  golden handcuffs , NQDCs take different forms, including bonus plans, equity ( stock ) arrangements, and  supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) , otherwise known as "" top hat plans ."" 9 10 
 
 
  NQDC plans have no caps on contributions and are typically offered only to top-level employees and key talent that the company wants to retain. Independent contractors are eligible for NQDC plans. 11  (This isn't the case with qualified deferred compensation plans.)
 
 
  Compensation is usually paid out when the employee retires, although there can be provisions for earlier payouts in case of certain events like a change in ownership of the company or a strictly-defined emergency. Depending on the terms of the contract, deferred compensation might be canceled by the company if the employee is fired, defects to a competitor, or otherwise forfeits the benefit. 
 
 
  From the participant's perspective, NQDC plans offer a reduced tax burden and a retirement savings bonus. This is especially valued by  highly compensated employees  because qualified 401(k) plans have annual contribution limits. 12 On the downside, the money in NQDC plans does not have the same protection as a 401(k) balance. If the company goes bankrupt, creditors can seize funds from NQDC plans. 10 
 
 
  For some companies, NQDC plans are a way to hire expensive talent without having to pay their full compensation immediately, meaning they can postpone funding the obligations. That approach, however, can be a gamble for the employee.
 
 
   Important 
 The employee pays  Social Security  and  Medicare taxes  on the deferred income at the time of the deferral but does not pay  income tax  on it until the funds are actually received. 13

"Line of Credit (LOC) Definition, Types, and Examples","What Is a Line of Credit (LOC)?    
  A line of credit (LOC) is a preset borrowing limit offered by banks and financial institutions to their personal and business customers. Lines of credit can be used at any time until the limit is reached. The limit is set by the issuer based on the borrower's  creditworthiness . As money is repaid, it can be borrowed again in the case of an open line of credit. The borrower can access funds from the LOC at any time as long as they do not exceed the maximum amount (or  credit limit ) set in the agreement.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A line of credit is a preset borrowing limit that a borrower can draw on at any time that the line of credit is open. Types of credit lines include personal, business, and home equity, among others. The built-in flexibility of a line of credit is its main advantage. Potential downsides include high interest rates, late payments penalties, and the potential to overspend. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Understanding Lines of Credit (LOCs)    
  A line of credit is a  credit  product that banks and other financial institutions offer their customers. They are available for both personal customers and business clients. Like other credit products, customers must qualify to be approved for a line of credit. Customers may apply for or be pre-approved for a credit line. The limit on the LOC is based on the borrower's creditworthiness. 
 
 
  All LOCs consist of a  set amount of money that can be borrowed  as needed, paid back, and borrowed again. The amount of interest, size of payments, and other rules are set by the lender. Some LOCs allow you to write checks, while others issue a debit card that can be used to access the available credit. A line of credit can be  secured or unsecured . Secured LOCs come with lower rates as they are backed by collateral while unsecured LOCs typically come with higher rates.
 
 
  The LOC is highly flexibility, which is its main advantage. Borrowers can request a certain amount, but they do not have to use it all. Rather, they can tailor their spending from the LOC to their needs and owe  interest  only on the amount that they draw, not on the entire credit line. In addition, borrowers can adjust their repayment amounts as needed based on their budget or cash flow. They can repay, for example, the entire outstanding balance all at once or just make the minimum monthly payments.
 
 
 
 
  There are different types of LOCs that financial institutions offer. Some of the most common types of LOCs include personal, business, and  home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) . We explore these in more detail below. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020 
 
    Unsecured vs. Secured Lines of Credit (LOCs)    
  Most LOCs are  unsecured loans . This means that the borrower does not promise the lender any  collateral  to back the LOC. One notable exception is a  home equity line of credit (HELOC) , which is secured by the  equity in the borrower’s home . From the lender’s perspective, secured LOCs are attractive because they provide a way to recoup the advanced funds in the event of nonpayment. 1 
 
 
  For individuals or business owners, secured LOCs are attractive because they typically come with a higher maximum credit limit and significantly lower interest rates than unsecured LOCs. Unsecured LOCs are also more difficult to obtain and often require a higher  credit score  or  credit rating .
 
 
  Lenders attempt to compensate for the increased  risk  by limiting how much can be borrowed and by charging higher interest rates. That is one reason why the  annual percentage rate (APR)  on credit cards is so high.
 
 
  Credit cards are technically unsecured LOCs, with the credit limit—how much you can charge on the card—representing its parameters. But you do not pledge any assets when you open the card. If you start missing payments, there’s nothing that the credit card issuer can seize in compensation.
 
 
   Important 
 An LOC can have a major impact on your credit score. In general, if you use more than 30% of the borrowing limit, your credit score will drop. 2 
 
 
 
    Revolving vs. Non-Revolving Lines of Credit (LOCs)    
  An LOC is often considered to be a type of revolving account, also known as an  open-end credit  account. This arrangement allows borrowers to spend the money, repay it, and spend it again in a virtually never-ending, revolving cycle. Revolving accounts such as  LOCs and credit cards are different from installment loans  such as mortgages and car loans.
 
 
  With  installment loans , consumers borrow a set amount of money and repay it in equal monthly installments until the loan is paid off. Once an installment loan has been paid off, consumers cannot spend the funds again unless they apply for a new loan.
 
 
  Non-revolving LOCs have the same features as revolving credit (or a revolving LOC). A credit limit is established, funds can be used for a varie","By

 Definition 
 Capitalism is an economic system where private individuals or businesses own capital goods, and the free market controls the production of goods and services. 
    What Is Capitalism?    
  Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals or businesses own capital goods. At the same time, business owners employ workers who receive only wages; labor doesn't own the means of production but instead uses them on behalf of the owners of capital.
 
 
  The production of goods and services under capitalism is based on supply and demand in the general market, also known as the  market economy . This is in contrast to a planned economy or a  command economy , in which prices are set through central planning.
 
 
  The purest form of capitalism is free-market or  laissez-faire  capitalism. Here, private individuals are unrestrained. They may determine where to invest, what to produce or sell, and at what prices to exchange goods and services. The laissez-faire marketplace operates without checks or controls. Today, most countries practice a mixed capitalist system that includes some degree of  government regulation  of business and some extent of public ownership of select industries. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production, with labor being paid solely in wages. Capitalism depends on the enforcement of private property rights, which provide incentives for investment in and productive use of capital. Capitalism developed out of feudalism and mercantilism in Europe, and dramatically expanded industrialization and the large-scale availability of mass-market consumer goods. Pure capitalism can be contrasted with pure socialism, in which all means of production are collective or state-owned. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A capitalist society relies on the use of contracts, fair dealing, and tort law to facilitate and enforce private property rights. 
 Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    Understanding Capitalism    
  Capitalism is one type of system of economic production and resource distribution. Instead of planning economic decisions through centralized political methods, as with socialism or feudalism, economic planning under capitalism occurs via decentralized, competitive, and voluntary decisions.
 
 
 
 
  Capitalism is essentially an economic system in which the means of production—factories, tools, machines, raw materials, and so on—are organized by one or more business owners, also known as capitalists. Capitalists then hire workers to operate the means of production in return for wages. Workers have no claim on the means of production or on the profits generated from their labor; these belong to the capitalists.

  Thus, private  property rights  are fundamental to capitalism. Most modern concepts of private property stem from John Locke's theory of homesteading, in which individuals claim ownership by mixing their labor with previously unclaimed resources. Once owned, the only legitimate means of transferring property are through voluntary exchange, gifts,  inheritance , or the re-homesteading of abandoned property. 2

Qualified Opinion: Definition and Place in Auditor’s Report,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Qualified Opinion?    
  A qualified opinion is a statement issued in an  auditor’s report  that accompanies a company’s audited financial statements. It is an  auditor’s opinion  that suggests the financial information provided by a company was limited in scope or there was a material issue with regard to the application of  generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) —but one that is not pervasive.
 
 
  Qualified opinions may also be issued if a company has inadequate disclosures in the  footnotes to the financial statements .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A qualified opinion is one of four possible auditor’s opinions on a company’s financial statement. The other auditor’s opinions are unqualified, adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion. A qualified opinion indicates that there was either a scope limitation, an issue discovered in the audit of the financials that was not pervasive, or an inadequate footnote disclosure. A qualified opinion is an auditor’s opinion that the financials are fairly presented, with the exception of a specified area. Unlike an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, a qualified opinion is generally still acceptable to lenders, creditors, and investors. The auditor’s opinion is usually found in the third and final section of an auditor’s report. 
 
    Understanding a Qualified Opinion    
  A qualified opinion may be given when a company’s financial records have not followed GAAP in all financial transactions, but only if the deviation from GAAP is not pervasive. The term “pervasive” can be interpreted differently based on an auditor’s professional judgment. However, to not be pervasive, the misstatement must not misrepresent the factual financial position of the company as a whole and should not affect the decision making of financial statement users.
 
 
  A qualified opinion may also be given due to a limitation of scope in which the auditor was not able to gather sufficient evidence to support various aspects of the financial statements. Without sufficient verification of transactions, an  unqualified opinion  may not be given. Inadequate disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, estimation uncertainty, or the lack of a  statement of cash flows  are also grounds for a qualified opinion.
 
 
 
 
    How a Qualified Opinion Is Represented    
  A qualified opinion is listed in the third and final section of an auditor’s report. The first section of the report outlines management’s responsibilities in regard to preparing the financial statements and maintaining  internal controls . The second section outlines the auditor’s responsibilities. In the third section, an opinion is given by the  independent auditor  regarding the company’s internal controls and accounting records. The opinion may be unqualified, qualified, adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion.
 
 
  A qualified opinion states that the  financial statements  of a corporate client are, with the exception of a specified area, fairly presented. Auditors typically qualify the auditor’s report with a statement such as “except for the following,” when they have insufficient information to verify certain aspects of the transactions and reports being audited.
 
 
  A qualified opinion is not so severe that it indicates that a business is doing poorly or that a company has hidden or falsified information, but rather, that the auditor simply cannot give an issue-free report. The auditor may specify that they believe the overall audit to be true and factual, but will specify the area that they believe is the issue.
 
 
    Qualified Opinion vs. Other Opinions    
  A qualified opinion is a reflection of the  auditor ’s inability to give an unqualified, or clean, audit opinion. An unqualified opinion is issued if the financial statements are presumed to be free from material misstatements. It is the most common type of auditor’s opinion.
 
 
  If the issues discovered during the audit result in material misstatements that would affect the decision making of the financial statement users, the opinion is escalated to an  adverse opinion . The adverse opinion results in the company needing to restate and complete another audit of its financial statements. A qualified opinion is still acceptable to most lenders, creditors, and investors.
 
 
  If the auditor is unable to complete the audit report due to the absence of financial records or insufficient cooperation from management, the auditor issues a disclaimer of opinion. This is an indication that no opinion over the financial statements was able to be determined.
 
 
   How Many Auditor’s Opinions Are Possible on a Financial Statement? 
 Four auditor’s opinions are possible on a company’s financial statement. The opinions are qualified, unqualified, adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion.

    What Is a Trust Fund?    
  A trust fund is an  estate planning  tool that holds property or assets for a person or an organization. Trust funds are sometimes simply referred to as ""trusts."" They can hold a variety of assets such as money, real property, stocks, bonds, a business, or a combination of many types of properties or  assets .
 
 
  Establishing a trust fund involves multiple parties: the grantor, the beneficiary or beneficiaries, and the trustee. Trust funds can have more than one beneficiary. They're managed by the trustee who has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the grantor and beneficiaries.
 
 
  Trust funds can take many forms and they can be established with different stipulations. They can be revocable or irrevocable. Some offer tax benefits and financial protections as well as support for those involved. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A trust fund is a legal entity designed to hold and manage assets on someone's behalf, usually with the help of a neutral third party. Trust fund parties include a grantor, beneficiary or beneficiaries, and a trustee. The grantor who creates the trust fund sets the terms for how assets are to be held, gathered, and distributed. The trustee manages the fund's assets and executes the grantor's directives. The beneficiary receives the assets or other benefits from the fund. Trust funds can be revocable or irrevocable and several variations can exist within these categories for specific purposes.

    How Trust Funds Work    
  Estate planning is a process that involves determining how an individual's assets and other financial affairs will be managed and how any property they own will be distributed after they die. Property can include any bank accounts, investments, personal property, real estate, and/or  life insurance . Wills are the most common estate planning tool but trust funds are also popular legal entities.  Laws governing trust funds  can vary depending on the country of residency and creation.

What Is the High-Low Method in Accounting?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the High-Low Method?    
  In  cost accounting , the high-low method is a way of attempting to separate out fixed and variable costs given a limited amount of data. The high-low method involves taking the highest level of activity and the lowest level of activity and comparing the  total costs at each level .
 
 
  If the variable cost is a fixed charge per unit and fixed costs remain the same, it is possible to determine the fixed and variable costs by solving the system of equations. It is worth being cautious when using the high-low method, however, as it can yield more or less accurate results depending on the distribution of values between the highest and lowest dollar amounts or quantities.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The high-low method is a simple way to segregate costs with minimal information. The simplicity of the approach assumes the variable and fixed costs as constant, which doesn’t replicate reality. Other cost-estimating methods, such as least-squares regression, might provide better results, although this method requires more complex calculations. 
 
    Understanding the High-Low Method    
  Calculating the outcome for the high-low method requires a few formula steps. First, you must calculate the variable-cost component and then the fixed-cost component, and then plug the results into the cost model formula. 
 First, determine the variable-cost component: 
 Variable Cost = HAC − Lowest Activity Cost HAUs − Lowest Activity Units where: HAC = Highest activity cost HAUs = Highest activity units Variable cost is per unit \begin{aligned} &\text{Variable Cost} = \frac { \text{HAC} - \text{Lowest Activity Cost} }{ \text{HAUs} - \text{Lowest Activity Units} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{HAC} = \text{Highest activity cost} \\ &\text{HAUs} = \text{Highest activity units} \\ &\text{Variable cost is per unit} \\ \end{aligned} ​ Variable Cost = HAUs − Lowest Activity Units HAC − Lowest Activity Cost ​ where: HAC = Highest activity cost HAUs = Highest activity units Variable cost is per unit ​ 
 Next, use the following formula to determine the fixed-cost component: 
 Fixed Cost = HAC − ( Variable Cost × HAUs ) \begin{aligned} &\text{Fixed Cost} = \text{HAC} - ( \text{Variable Cost} \times \text{HAUs} ) \\ \end{aligned} ​ Fixed Cost = HAC − ( Variable Cost × HAUs ) ​ 
 Use the results of the first two formulas to calculate the high-low cost result using the following formula: 
 High-Low Cost = Fixed Cost + ( Variable Cost × UA ) where: UA = Unit activity \begin{aligned} &\text{High-Low Cost} = \text{Fixed Cost} + ( \text{Variable Cost} \times \text{UA} ) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{UA} = \text{Unit activity} \\ \end{aligned} ​ High-Low Cost = Fixed Cost + ( Variable Cost × UA ) where: UA = Unit activity ​ 
 
 
 
 
    What the High-Low Method Tells You    
  The costs associated with a product, product line, equipment, store, geographic sales region, or subsidiary consist of both  variable costs  and  fixed costs . To determine both cost components of the total cost, an analyst or accountant can use a technique known as the high-low method.
 
 
  The high-low method is used to calculate the variable and fixed costs of a product or entity with mixed costs. It takes two factors into consideration. It considers the total dollars of the mixed costs at the highest volume of activity and the total dollars of the  mixed costs  at the lowest volume of activity. The total amount of fixed costs is assumed to be the same at both points of activity. The change in the total costs is thus the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity.
 
 
    Example of How to Use the High-Low Method    
  For example, the table below depicts the activity for a cake bakery for each of the 12 months of a given year.
 
 
  Below is an example of the high-low method of cost accounting:
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Month 
 Cakes Baked (units) 
 Total Cost ($) 
 
 
 January 
 115

 October

 $5,550 
 
 
 November 
 110 
 $5,100 
 
 
 December 
 120 
 $5,700 
 
 
 
 
 
  The highest activity for the bakery occurred in October, when it baked the highest number of cakes, while August had the lowest activity level, with only 70 cakes baked at a cost of $3,750. The cost amounts adjacent to these activity levels will be used in the high-low method, even though these cost amounts are not necessarily the highest and lowest costs for the year.
 
 
  We calculate the fixed and variable costs using the following steps:
 
 
    1. Calculate variable cost per unit using identified high and low activity levels    
   Variable Cost = TCHA − Total Cost of Low Activity HAU − Lowest Activity Unit Variable Cost = $ 5 , 5 5 0 − $ 3 , 7 5 0 1 2 5 − 7 0 Variable Cost = $ 1 , 8 0 0 5 5 =","By

Zombies: Financial Term for Distressed Companies,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Are Zombies?    
  Zombies are companies that earn just enough money to continue operating and service  debt  but are unable to pay off their debt. Such companies, given that they just scrape by meeting  overheads  (wages, rent, interest payments on debt, for example), have no excess  capital  to invest to spur growth. Zombie companies are typically subject to higher borrowing costs and may be one just event— market disruption  or a poor quarter performance—away from  insolvency  or a bailout. Zombies are especially dependent on banks for financing, which is fundamentally their life support. Zombie companies are also known as the ""living dead"" or ""zombie stocks.""
 
 
   Key Takeaways: 
 Zombies are companies that earn just enough money to continue operating and service their debt. Zombie companies have no excess capital to spur growth and are considered close to insolvency. In rare cases, a zombie company might stretch itself financially, produce a lucrative product, and reduce its liabilities. Zombies are high-risk investments, and not for the faint-hearted. 
 
    Understanding Zombies    
  Zombies often fail, falling victim to the high costs associated with debt or certain operations, such as research and development. They may lack the resources for capital investment, which would create growth. If a zombie company employed so many people that its failure would become a political issue, it may be deemed "" too big to fail ,"" as was the case with many financial institutions during the 2008 financial crisis. Given that many analysts expect that zombies will eventually be unable to meet their financial obligations, such companies are considered riskier investments and will, therefore, see their share prices suppressed.
 
 
  Zombies were first spoken of in reference to companies in Japan during the country's "" Lost Decade "" of the 1990s following the bursting of its  asset price bubble . During this period, companies were dependent on bank backing to remain in operation, even though they were bloated, inefficient, or failing. Economists argue that the economy would have been better served by allowing such poorly performing companies to fail. The term ""zombies"" was picked up again in 2008 in response to U.S. government bailouts that were part of the  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) .
 
 
  While the ranks of zombie companies are small, years of loose  monetary policy  highlighted by  quantitative easing , high leverage and historically low interest rates, have contributed to their growth. Economists argue that such policies preserve inefficiencies while stifling productivity, growth, and innovation. When the market shifts, zombies will be the first to fall victim, unable to meet their basic obligations as rising interest rates make their debt more expensive to service. Meanwhile, successful companies, which are less able to build on their success because of tight credit, may feel any downturn more than they should.
 
 
 
 
  While keeping zombies on life support may preserve jobs, economists note that using such resources is misguided because it impedes growth at successful firms and, therefore, inhibits job creation.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
    Zombie Investors    
  Because a zombie's life expectancy tends to be highly unpredictable, zombie stocks are extremely risky and are not suitable for all investors. For example, a small biotech firm may stretch its funds extremely thin by concentrating its efforts in research and development in the hope of creating a blockbuster drug. If the drug fails, the company can go  bankrupt  within days of the announcement. On the other hand, if the drug is successful, the company could profit and reduce its liabilities. In most cases, however, zombie stocks are unable to overcome the financial burdens of their high burn rates and most eventually dissolve.
 
 
  Given the lack of attention paid to this group, there are often interesting opportunities for investors who have a high risk tolerance and are seeking speculative opportunities.

    What Is a Unit Investment Trust (UIT)?    
  A unit investment trust (UIT) is an investment company that offers a fixed portfolio of stocks and bonds as redeemable units to investors for a specific period. It is designed to provide  capital appreciation  and/or dividend income. UITs, along with  mutual funds  and  closed-end funds , are defined as investment companies.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A unit investment trust is a U.S. financial company that buys or holds a group of securities and makes them available to investors as redeemable units. UITs are similar to open- and closed-end mutual funds because they all pool capital from investors and are managed by portfolio managers. These trusts are bought and sold directly from the issuing company or on the secondary market and are issued via an IPO. Unlike mutual funds, UITs have a stated expiration date based on what investments are held in their portfolios. They aren’t actively traded, which means securities aren’t bought or sold unless there’s a change in the underlying investment. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Julie Bang / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)    
  Investment companies offer individuals the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities with a low initial investment requirement. UITs are sold by investment advisors and an owner can redeem the units to the fund or trust, rather than placing a trade in the  secondary market .
 
 
  A UIT is either a  regulated investment corporation (RIC)  or a  grantor  trust. A RIC is a corporation in which the investors are joint owners, and a grantor trust grants investors proportional ownership in the UIT’s  underlying securities .
 
 
  Investors can redeem UIT units (or mutual fund shares) at  net asset value (NAV)  to the fund or trust either directly or with the help of an investment advisor. NAV is defined as the total value of the portfolio divided by the number of shares or units outstanding, and the NAV is calculated each business day.
 
 
  On the other hand, closed-end funds are not redeemable and are sold in the  secondary market  at the current market price. The market price of a closed-end fund is based on investor demand and not as a calculation of net asset value.

    Types of Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)    
  Though the underlying characteristics of a UIT are often the same across different types of trusts, there are different strategies for UITs. These different types will vary in the underlying assets that are purchased and held, as each of the following UITs will have a different investment strategy:
 
 
 
 Strategy portfolio :   This type of UIT strives to beat a market benchmark and outperform general investments. This UIT leverages fundamental analysis to determine what investments may beat the market. 
 Income portfolio : This type of UIT strives to generate dividend income. It often deprioritizes capital appreciation in favor of generating income. 
 Diversification  portfolio : This type of UIT strives to diversify the portfolio assets across a broad range of investments. It aims to minimize risks.

"Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loan: Requirements, Limits, How to Qualify","What Is a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loan?    
  A Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan is a home mortgage that is insured by the government and issued by a bank or other lender approved by the agency. FHA loans require a lower minimum down payment than many  conventional loans , and applicants may have  lower credit scores  than the  best mortgage lenders  usually require.  FHA loans are designed to help  low- to moderate-income families attain homeownership, and they are particularly popular with first-time homebuyers.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 FHA loans are mortgages intended for  certain borrowers  who might find it difficult to obtain loans otherwise. 
 The federal government insures FHA loans issued by private lenders, such as banks. 
 FHA borrowers must pay two types of mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs)—one upfront and the other monthly. 
 Due to FHA insurance, banks are more willing to lend to homebuyers with low credit scores and small down payments. 
 First-time homebuyers may find that an FHA loan is their most affordable mortgage option. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou. 
 
    How an FHA Loan Works    
  FHA loan criteria allow for borrowers with a lower-than-average credit score of at least 580 to qualify for an FHA-insured mortgage. Your credit score represents a numerical summary of your creditworthiness based on your credit history, such as how well you repay your debts.
 
 
  FHA loan criteria also allow borrowers to put down a smaller down payment at the loan's closing. The FHA mandates that the  loan-to-value (LTV) ratio  cannot exceed 96.5% of the value of a home with an FHA loan. In other words, you can have a down payment as low as 3.5% of the purchase price, meaning you can qualify for FHA financing of up to 95.5% of the property's value. 1 2 
 
 
  However, if your credit score falls between 500 and 579, you can still get FHA financing, but you will need to make a down payment of at least 10%, meaning you can only finance up to 90% of the property's value. 1 
 
 
 
 
  With FHA loans, the down payment can come from savings, a financial gift from a family member, or a  grant  for down payment assistance.
 
 
    The Bank's Role in an FHA Loan    
  The FHA doesn't actually lend anyone money to buy a home. Instead, FHA-approved lenders via banks or other financial institutions issue the mortgage loans.
 
 
  The role of the FHA involves guaranteeing or insuring the loan, making it easier for borrowers to get approved since the lender does not bear the default risk. 2 
 
 
  Borrowers who qualify for an FHA loan are required to purchase  mortgage insurance , with the  premium  payments going to the FHA. 3 
 
 
 
 
    History of the FHA Loan    
  Congress created the FHA in 1934 during the  Great Depression . At that time, the housing industry was in trouble: Default and foreclosure rates had skyrocketed, 50% down payments were commonly required, and the mortgage terms were impossible for ordinary wage earners to meet. As a result, the U.S. was primarily a nation of renters, and only one in 10 households owned their homes. 4 
 
 
  After the government created the FHA to reduce the risk to lenders and make it easier for borrowers to qualify for home loans, the homeownership rate in the U.S. steadily climbed, reaching an all-time high of 69.2% in 2004, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. By the end of 2024, the rate stood at 65.7%. 5 
 
 
   Important 
 Though principally designed for lower-income borrowers, FHA loans are available to everyone, including those who can afford conventional mortgages. In general, borrowers with good credit and strong financials will be better off with a conventional mortgage, while those with poorer credit and more debt, as well as would-be homebuyers who simply don't have the cash for a larger down payment, can benefit from an FHA loan. 
 
 
 
    Other Types of FHA Loans    
  In addition to traditional mortgages, the FHA offers several other  home loan types .
 
 
    Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)    
  This is a  reverse mortgage  program that helps homeowners age 62 and older convert the equity in their homes to cash while retaining the home's title. The homeowner can take the funds as a lump sum, in a fixed monthly amount, in a  line of credit , or some combination. 6 
 
 
    FHA 203(k) Improvement Loan    
  This loan factors the cost of certain repairs and renovations into the amount borrowed. 7  It's helpful for those willing to buy a fixer-upper and put some sweat equity into their home.
 
 
    FHA Energy Efficient Mortgage    
  This program is similar to the FHA 203(k)  improvement loan  program, but it's focused on upgrades that can lower your utility bills, such as new insulation or solar or wind energy systems. 8

"Official Strike: What It Is, How It Works, Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 An official strike is a work stoppage by union members that is endorsed by the union and that follows the legal requirements for striking. 
    What is an Official Strike?    
  An official strike happens when a union and its members legally stop working by following such rules and regulations as the work stoppage being agreed to by a majority of union members.
 
 
  Workers engaging in official strikes have better protections against being fired, as opposed to an  unofficial strike . An official strike is usually undertaken by employees as a last resort in response to grievances. An official strike may also be called an official industrial action, a strike action, or just a strike.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An official strike is one that complies with the required legal processes for declaring and carrying out a strike or other work stoppage. Official strikes are considered protected concerted action under the National Labor Relations Act, but whether any particular strike counts as official or not can depend on rulings by the National Labor Relations Board.  Workers engaged in an official strike enjoy better legal protections against dismissal or retaliation by their employer. 
 
    Understanding an Official Strike    
  In the U.S., industrial labor relations are governed by the  National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)  under the National Labor Relations Act and other relevant laws. Ultimately, the NLRB decides whether a strike complies with the requirements to be considered an official strike. These laws grant workers the right to engage in protected concerted activity, including strikes, provided they follow the required legal processes laid out in the law and enforced by the NLRB.
 
 
  An official strike follows these processes and is thus legally recognized and protected under the law by the NLRB. Workers who engage in an official strike can enjoy protection from retaliation by their employer, such as being disciplined or dismissed. 1  
 
 
  Strikes are undertaken as part of the collective bargaining process between  labor unions  and employers to determine wages, benefits, working conditions, and, in the case of public servants, legislation governing said services. Generally, union members will vote to go on strike when other bargaining tactics have failed.
 
 
 
 
  When workers decide to strike without the approval of a union, it is called a wildcat strike. A wildcat strike may be undertaken when a union refuses to endorse a strike action, or because the striking workers do not have a union; such a strike may not offer workers the same protections as an official strike undertaken with formal union authorization.
 
 
  Typically, striking workers refuse to go to work and may instead form a picket line outside the place of work to hinder the employer’s normal business or stop strikebreakers from crossing the picket line to go to work. Sometimes, workers conduct a strike by occupying the workplace but refusing to complete their normal tasks and also refusing to leave the premises; such a strike is known as a sit-down strike. Where employees are public servants, picketing may occur, not at the workplace, but where lawmakers meet.
 
 
    Historical Example    
  Strikes are often the result of an accumulation of grievances by workers that have compounded over time. They can be set off by such things as a long lack of  wage  increases or safety conditions, and workers may be galvanized to strike by political rhetoric or pushback from corporate management.
 
 
  In 2024 port workers union and auto workers union both held strikes. These most recent walkouts, however, have not come close to those strikes that make up the  10 biggest in U.S. history .
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Sabrina Jiang / Investopedia 
 
  One famous official strike in the United States was the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, which canceled the end of the regular season and the entire postseason. 2  Some of the replacement players who played during 1995 spring training, when the strike had not yet ended, remained in the major leagues, but were not allowed union membership. One reason this is important is union players receive a certain percentage of Major League Baseball revenues, because MLB licenses players' names and images for items like jerseys and baseball cards. Nonunion members do not receive this benefit.
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  The legally protected ability to strike has long been a negotiation tool for many American workers and  labor unions . Throughout U.S. history, workers have held official strikes across industries demanding higher pay, more manageable work hours, better contracts and benefits, and improved working conditions.

What Is a White Paper?,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 White papers can be used to launch a product, highlight a problem to solicit solutions, or provide technical specifications. 
    What Is a White Paper?    
  A white paper is an informational document issued by a company or not-for-profit organization to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service that it offers or will introduce. A  startup , a large corporation, or a government agency will use white papers differently.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A white paper promotes a certain product, service, or methodology to influence current and prospective customers or investors. Three types of white papers include backgrounders, numbered lists, and problem/solution white papers. White papers are commonly designed for business-to-business (B2B) marketing purposes between a manufacturer and a wholesaler, or between a wholesaler and a retailer. 
 
    Using a White Paper    
  White papers are sales and marketing documents used to entice or persuade potential customers to explore a particular product, service, technology, or methodology. A white paper may communicate an organization’s philosophy or present research findings related to an industry.
 
 
  White papers are commonly designed for  business-to-business (B2B)  marketing purposes between a manufacturer and a  wholesaler , or between a wholesaler and a retailer. The information presented in white papers is often backed by research and statistics from reliable sources and may include charts, graphs, tables, and other ways of visualizing data. 
 
 
    Types    
   Backgrounders : Detail the technical features of a new product or service. Designed to simplify complicated technical information, they are used to support a technical evaluation, launch a product, or promote a product or industry leader.  Numbered lists : Highlight the key takeaways of a new product or service, and are often formatted with headings and bullet points, or with formats like ""3 Questions to Ask,"" or ""5 Things You Need to Know."" Problem/solution papers : Identify specific problems faced by potential customers and suggest a data-driven argument about how a featured product or service provides a solution to generate new sales, educate salespeople on product characteristics, or build industry interest. 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 White papers are commonly 2,500 words or more in length and written in an academic style. 1 
 
 
 
    Writing a White Paper    
  White papers differ from other  marketing  materials, such as brochures. Brochures and traditional marketing materials might be flashy and obvious, but a white paper is intended to provide factual evidence that solves a problem or challenge.

  A white paper should provide well-researched information that is not found with a simple Internet search and has a compelling narrative to keep the reader’s attention. The author of a white paper should:
 
 
   Research and fully define the topic Create an accurate outline of information Write an attention-grabbing introduction Format the paper for easy reading Revise and proofread 
 
 
    Examples    
  All of the documents listed below and publicly available on Microsoft’s website focus on aspects of the company’s suite of cloud services. In contrast with brochures, these white papers don’t have a clear sales pitch. Instead, they dive into relevant topics, such as cloud security, hybrid clouds, and the economic benefits of adopting cloud computing.

   How Have New Industries Used White Papers? 
 Cryptocurrencies have published white papers during  initial coin offerings (ICOs)  to entice users and investors. Bitcoin launched a few months after the pseudonymous Satoshi  Nakamoto issued its famous white paper  online in October 2008. 2 
 
 
   Why Is It Called a White Paper? 
 White papers may have developed from the use of “Blue Papers” in 19th-century Britain, where a Parliament report cover was blue. When a topic for the government was less serious, the blue cover was discarded and published with white covers. These reports were called White Papers. In the U.S., government white papers are commonly a background report or guidance. 3 
 
 
   What Topics Might Be Included in a Government White Paper? 
 Government white papers are written and used by legislators or policymakers to examine a problem and present solutions to elected officials, non-profit organizations,  think tanks , corporations, and citizens. 4","By

Qualified Retirement Plan: Definition and 2 Main Types,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Qualified Retirement Plan?    
  A qualified retirement plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that meets the requirements of the  Internal Revenue Code (IRC)  and the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) , making it eligible for certain tax benefits. These can include tax deductions for employer and employee contributions and  tax deferral  of investment  gains .
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A qualified retirement plan is an employer-sponsored plan that meets Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. Labor Department requirements and offers certain tax benefits to employees and employers. Those benefits can include tax deductions for contributions and tax deferral of investment gains until the money is withdrawn from the account. Qualified retirement plans can be either defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Examples of qualified retirement plans include traditional pensions, 401(k) plans, and profit-sharing plans. 
 
    Understanding Qualified Retirement Plans    
  Qualified retirement plans come in two main types:  defined benefit  and  defined contribution .
 
 
  There are also some other plans that are hybrids of the two, such as a  cash balance plan .
 
 
  Defined-benefit plans give employees a guaranteed  payout  after retirement and place the risk on the employer to save and invest properly to meet plan  liabilities . A traditional,  annuity -type  pension  is an example of a defined-benefit plan.
 
 
  With defined-contribution plans, the amount of money that employees will have available to them in retirement depends on how much they contribute and how successfully they invest those contributions. The employee typically chooses what to invest in and bears all of the investment risk. A  401(k)  is the most popular example of a defined contribution plan.

 Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP) plans 
 Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans 
 Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plans 
 
 
 
 
    Requirements for Qualified Retirement Plans    
  The tax code lays out a long list of requirements that plans must meet to be qualified.
 
 
  For example, employees must be eligible to participate in the plan no later than the date when they turn 21 years old or the date when they complete one year of service, whichever comes later. 1 
 
 
  Once they are eligible to participate, employees must be allowed to join the plan no later than the first day of the first plan year beginning after the date when they met the minimum age and service requirements or six months after the date when they satisfied those requirements, whichever comes earlier. 1 
 
 
  The tax code also establishes the rules for  vesting ,  employer matching contributions ,  rollovers ,  distributions , and more. 1 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Employers have some leeway within these rules, but once they have put the specifics of their plan in writing—as they are required to do—they must adhere to them unless they amend the plan. 
 
 
 
  Qualified retirement plans are also subject to the rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. One of its chief requirements is that plan sponsors (employers) and administrators act as  fiduciaries , meaning that they must make investment decisions in the best interest of plan participants. If they fail to do that, they can be held personally liable to make up any losses. 2 
 
 
    Tax Benefits of Qualified Retirement Plans    
  Employers that provide qualified retirement plans for their employees can take a tax deduction for the money they contribute to the plans up to certain limits. 3  Those limits depend on the type of plan, with defined-benefit plans having higher contribution limits than defined-contribution plans. 4 
 
 
  The  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  also sets limits for the  maximum amount of contributions  an employee can make to the plan.
 
 
  With traditional defined-contribution plans, employees can take a tax deduction for their contributions, reducing their taxable income and, therefore, their taxes for the year. They’ll pay tax on that income only when they later withdraw it, usually in retirement. In the meantime, the investment earnings on the money in their account will be tax-deferred, again until it’s withdrawn. ( Roth-type accounts  are an exception here—they don’t provide any tax deduction going in, but later withdrawals will be tax and penalty-","By

What Is Unearned Income and How Is It Taxed?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Unearned Income?    
  Unearned income refers to any  income  that is earned passively, without performing work or providing a service. In contrast to earned income, which comes from wages, salaries, and business activities, unearned income is derived from investments or other sources where no labor is involved. Common examples of unearned income, or  passive income , include interest from savings accounts, dividends from stocks, and rental income from properties.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Unearned income is passive income that is not acquired through work or business activities. Examples of unearned income include inheritance money and interest or dividends earned from investments. Tax rates on unearned income are different from rates on earned income. While unearned income may supplement earned income before retirement, it often becomes the primary source of income in retirement years. 
 
    Understanding Unearned Income    
  Unearned income is typically earned through investments, such as interest on savings, dividends from stocks, or income from rental properties. Unlike  earned income , which includes wages and self-employment earnings, unearned income is not tied to labor.
 
 
  Unearned income cannot be contributed to  individual retirement accounts (IRAs) . According to the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) , earned income includes wages, salaries, tips, and self-employment income. 1 
 
 
   Taxation  differs for unearned income and earned income due to qualitative differences. The  tax rates  also vary among unearned income sources. Most unearned income sources are not subject to  payroll taxes , and none of it is subject to employment taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare. 2 3 
 
 
   Important 
 Make sure you understand the origin and taxation of any of your unearned income. 
 
 
 
    Types of Unearned Income    
  Unearned income can fall into a number of different categories. Below are some of the most common types:
 
 
 
 
    Interest    
   Interest  income from savings accounts, bonds, loans, and  Certificates of deposit (CDs)  is considered unearned income. This type of income is typically taxed as  ordinary income . 4 
 
 
  There are certain exceptions to this rule, including interest earned on  municipal bonds , which is exempt from  federal income tax . 5 
 
 
    Dividends    
   Dividends , which are income from investments, can be taxed at ordinary tax rates or preferred  long-term capital gains tax  rates. 6  Investments typically yield dividends payable to shareholders on a regular basis. Dividends may be paid to the investment account monthly, quarterly, annually, or semi-annually.
 
 
  Taxation of dividends is based on whether the dividend is ordinary or qualified:
 
 
 
 Ordinary dividends , the more common form of dividends that investors receive from a company, are taxed at ordinary tax rates. 
 Qualified dividends  are taxed at the more favorable capital gains tax rates. In order to qualify as qualified dividends, they must be issued by a U.S. corporation or qualified foreign corporation, the investor must own them for at least 60 days out of a 121-day holding period, and they cannot be in a category of dividends otherwise excluded from the qualified dividend classification. 7 
 
 
    Other Sources of Unearned Income    
  You may get unearned income from other sources, such as:
 
 
 
 Retirement accounts like  401(k)s , pensions, and  annuities 
 Inheritances 
 Alimony 
 Gifts 
 Lottery winnings 
 Veterans Affairs benefits 
 Social Security benefits 
 Welfare benefits 
 Unemployment  compensation 
 Property income 8 
 
 
    Benefits of Unearned Income    
  Unearned income can serve as a supplement to earned income before  retirement , and it is often the only source of income in postretirement years. During the accumulation phase, taxes are deferred for many sources of unearned income.
 
 
  Sources of unearned income that allow a deferment of income tax include  401(k) plans  and annuity income. As a result, participants avoid IRS penalties and higher tax rates. 9 10 
 
 
   Tip 
 Tax advisors often recommend  diversifying holdings  to even out the effect of taxes on unearned income. 
 
 
 
    Examples of Unearned Income    
  Here are a couple of hypothetical examples to show how unearned income actually works.
 
 
    Example 1    
  Let's say Jan invests $50,000 in a CD. The interest she derives from her investment is considered unearned income and must be reported to the IRS for taxation at the ordinary income rate. 4  She also wins $10,000 on a game show, but she does not get the full amount of her winnings. Why? Because the IRS deducts taxes from it, treating the amount as unearned income. 11 
 
 
    Example 2    
  Let's suppose Michael buys an  investment property  with the intention of renting it out for additional income. He fixes it up and converts it into two apartments: the main unit and the basement as a separate studio. He","By

Lyft vs. Uber: What’s the Difference?,"Close 
 
 
 
    Lyft vs. Uber: An Overview    
  Sometimes it’s safer or more convenient to leave the driving and traffic headaches to someone else. This idea is what eventually grew into ride-hailing app giants Uber and Lyft, the two quintessential transportation network companies.
 
 
  In a race to the finish line, Uber released its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) prospectus about two weeks after rival Lyft debuted on the public market. 1 2 
 
 
  These app-based services may seem interchangeable, but there are differences between the two largest taxi alternatives in the United States.
 
 
  Lyft operates in the U.S. and Canada. 3  The company sets specific requirements on the vehicles used by drivers and has several different categories or levels of service. The Lyft app for smartphones notifies passengers of the driver’s arrival and gives them an estimated cost in advance.
 
 
  Uber serves consumers in the U.S. and Canada as well as many other cities worldwide, including those in the European Union (EU), Central and South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. 4 
 
 
  Uber also sets vehicle requirements and lists several different categories of service. The Uber app helps passengers and drivers find one another and estimates the cost of the ride in advance.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 Uber ( UBER ) and Lyft ( LYFT ) are companies with ride-hailing apps, and both offer innovative alternatives to taxis and long-established private transportation services. 
 Both give passengers a convenient and innovative way using their  smartphones  to request and pay for rides. 
 The companies have considerable differences in their service areas, offerings, and culture. 
 Because each company’s drivers are independent contractors with varying vehicle types and personalities, even if you consistently use the same service in the same city, each trip will be different. 
 Uber and Lyft also offer food delivery services for people who use their apps. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    Lyft    
  Lyft launched as a service in 2012. It was spawned from Zimride, a company founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer.
 
 
  Zimride, a peer-to-peer rideshare matchmaker for people looking to carpool long distances securely, was sold so that the duo could focus on Lyft. 5  David Risher is currently the  chief executive officer (CEO) . 6 
 
 
    Going Public and Market Share    
  On Dec. 6, 2018, Lyft announced that the company had officially filed paperwork with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  to go public in March 2019. 7 8  The company’s stock trades on the  Nasdaq . 9 
 
 
  Lyft said it expected to raise $2 billion in its IPO and would offer 30.77 million shares of  common stock  at an expected $62 to $68 per share. The company eventually priced its shares at $72, raising an estimated 2.2 billion on March 28, 2019. 10 11 
 
 
  Before filing for an IPO, Lyft raised $600 million in a  financing  round led by Fidelity Management & Research Co. in June 2018, increasing its value to $15.1 billion. 12 
 
 
  Also, a month before, Lyft revealed  market share  figures for the first time, suggesting that it had 35% of the U.S. ridesharing market and a majority of the share in multiple markets across the country. 13 
 
 
  In February 2019, Reuters reported that Lyft estimated the market share figure to be closer to 40%. 14 
 
 
  Lyft might have gained market share from Uber as a result of several controversies, many of which took place in the months leading up to the IPO announcement. However, its share fell back toward around one-quarter of the  market  in subsequent years.
 
 
   24% 
 Lyft’s share of the ride-sharing market, as of March 2024, according to Bloomberg Second Measure. 15 
 
    Operation and Services    
  Lyft’s website shows the cities where the ride service operates in Canada and in the U.S., where it serves all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 3 
 
 
  The company has a set minimum vehicle requirement, and drivers must pass two background checks before approval by the company. 16 
 
 
  Automobiles must have four doors with a minimum of five seat belts. The age and condition of the vehicle, among other requirements, vary by state. 17 
 
 
  The company offers several service classes, which vary by city: 18 
 
 
   Original Lyft provides rides in regular vehicles for up to four passengers. Lyft XL provides rides in SUVs for up to six passengers. Lyft Black is a premium black car service including luxury vehicles, for up to four passengers. Lyft Black SUV provides rides in a premium black SUV for up to six people. 
 
 
    Cost of Lyft Services    
  According to a 2015 study from smartphone app SherpaShare, the average cost of a Lyft ride came in at $12.53. 19 
 
 
  In 2021, though, prices seemed to jump dramatically, due to a pandemic-easing combination of pent-up demand and a shortage of drivers. Between January 2020 and July 2021, average ride share prices increased by 50%, hitting","By

"Kiosk: Definition in Retail, History, Types, and Risks","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A kiosk is a booth for marketing and selling products or services, located in a high-traffic area and either staffed by one or two individuals or operated electronically. 
    What Is a Kiosk?    
  A kiosk refers to a small, temporary, stand-alone booth used in high-traffic areas for  marketing  purposes. Sales of products and services can also be transacted at kiosks.
 
 
  A kiosk is usually manned by one or two individuals who help attract attention to the booth to get new customers. Retail kiosks are frequently located in shopping malls or on busy city streets with significant  foot traffic . They provide owners with a low-cost marketing alternative for their products or services.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A kiosk refers to a small, temporary, stand-alone booth used in high-traffic areas for marketing and sales. Kiosks may be manned by one or two individuals or may be unmanned and electronic. These booths are considered to be low-cost marketing methods that are great alternatives for new, emerging entrepreneurs. The different types of kiosks include employment kiosks, food-service kiosks, healthcare kiosks, Bitcoin kiosks, and photo kiosks. Kiosks can help raise brand awareness and provide an interactive way for consumers to engage with a company. They can also be frustrating if they are not maintained properly, potentially hurting a brand’s image. 
 
    Understanding Kiosks    
  Kiosks are generally small booths set up in high-traffic areas. You may see them in the walkways of shopping centers. They may be manned by individuals who sell a product or service—anything from toys and hair care products to insurance or  credit cards .
 
 
  Kiosks are not always supervised by humans. Some, in fact, are electronic, providing consumers with a self-service experience. These kiosks normally complement an existing service already offered by the kiosk owner.
 
 
 
 
  For example, some provincial government agencies in Canada allow the general public to perform certain tasks like renewing car registration or updating personal information for health cards and driver’s licenses using electronic kiosks that act much like  automated teller machines (ATMs) .
 
 
  This allows the consumer to execute these tasks on their own without having to travel to and wait in line at a provincial ministry.
 
 
    Low Cost Marketing    
  Because of their small, temporary natures, kiosks can fulfill low-cost marketing strategies. Malls and other  lessors  may charge kiosk owners a smaller amount of rent than the rent charged those with a larger retail space.
 
 
  Kiosks can be a great way for new, emerging  entrepreneurs  to give their businesses a kick-start without spending a lot. That’s because they give companies a human face and provide customers with the opportunity to ask questions about products and services. Electronic kiosks give consumers a hassle-free, convenient information portal or transaction experience.
 
 
    History of Kiosks    
  Kiosks in the form of simple stalls or booths have been around for hundreds of years. The first vending machines date back to the 1880s, which is when the idea of self service first became known to the public. These vending machines sold simple items, such as chewing gum and postcards.
 
 
  ATMs first came into use in the 1960s and set the template for how kiosks are known today. These types of machines took a while to catch on, as individuals still preferred conducting financial transactions in person.
 
 
  In 1970, IBM partnered with American Airlines and American Express to create the first airline ticket self-service kiosk. In 1977, the first complete self-service interactive kiosk was established at the University of Illinois, providing campus information to students and visitors.
 
 
  In 1985, Florsheim Shoe Co. established the first network of kiosks. It consisted of 600 kiosks where shoppers could search for shoes in other locations, pay for them, and have them shipped directly to their homes. 1 
 
 
    Types of Kiosks    
  Kiosks vary based on the nature of the  business  and whether the owner intends to make it electronic or staff it with individuals. The location generally relates to the nature of the kiosk as well.
 
 
  A local newspaper might set up a kiosk at a grocery store to sign up new subscribers. Similarly, credit card companies often set up kiosks in airports to seek new customers for a credit card that offers frequent-flyer miles.
 
 
    Employment Kiosks    
  In addition to kiosks that sell retail products or services, some companies set up employment kiosks where job seekers can apply for work. This type of kiosk is especially common in chain stores such as Walmart.
 
 
  Employment kiosks provide a way to quickly identify promising candidates, who will often receive an interview on the spot.
 
 
  The kiosk may include a computer station at which the applicant can use a keyboard or touchscreen to input their employment hist","By

Know Your Client (KYC): What It Means and Compliance Requirements,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Know Your Client (KYC)?    
  Know Your Client (KYC) is a standard in the investment industry that ensures  advisors  can verify a client's identity and know their client's investment knowledge and financial profile.
 
 
  Three components of KYC include the customer identification program (CIP), imposed under the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, customer due diligence (CDD), and ongoing monitoring or enhanced due diligence (EDD) of a customer's account once it is established. 1 2

    KYC Requirements    
    Customer Identification Program    
  CIP requires that financial firms obtain four pieces of identifying information about a client, including name, date of birth, address, and identification number. 5 
 
 
 
 
    Customer Due Diligence    
  CDD is a process in which all of a customer’s credentials are collected to verify their identity and evaluate their risk profile for suspicious account activity.
 
 
    Enhanced Due Diligence    
  EDD is used for customers that are at a higher risk of infiltration, terrorism financing, or money laundering and additional information collection is often necessary.  
 
 
    KYC Compliance    
  Two rules governing KYC include  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  (FINRA) Rule 2090 (Know Your Customer) and FINRA Rule 2111 (Suitability).
 
 
  FINRA Rule 2090 requires every broker-dealer to use reasonable diligence when opening and maintaining client accounts and to know and keep records on the profile of each customer, as well as identify each person who has the authority to act on the customer’s behalf. 6 
 
 
  FINRA Rule 2111 notes that a broker-dealer must have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation is suitable for a customer based on the client’s financial situation and needs. This rule assumes that the broker-dealer has completed a review of the current facts and profile of the customer, including the customer’s other securities and investments before making any purchase, sale, or exchange of a security on the client's behalf. 7 
 
 
    AML and KYC    
  The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requires both customers and financial institutions to comply with KYC standards to prevent illegal activity, specifically money laundering. AML, anti-money laundering, is a term for the range of measures and processes used to achieve regulatory compliance. KYC is a component of AML.
 
 
  FinCEN requires financial institutions to understand the type and purpose of the customer relationship and develop a customer risk profile, used as a baseline for detecting suspicious customer activities. 8 9 
 
 
  Financial institutions must also maintain current and  accurate customer information  and continue to monitor accounts for suspicious and illegal activities. When detected, they are required to promptly report their findings. 10 
 
 
    KYC and Cryptocurrency    
  The cryptocurrency market is praised for providing a decentralized medium of exchange that promotes confidentiality. However, these benefits also present challenges in preventing money laundering. Criminals see cryptocurrency as a vehicle to launder money and as a result, governing bodies are looking for ways to impose KYC on cryptocurrency markets. 11

    What Is Adverse Selection?    
  Adverse selection refers to a situation in which sellers have information that buyers do not have, or vice versa. This asymmetric information can then be exploited.
 
 
   Asymmetric information , also called information failure, occurs when one party to a transaction has greater material knowledge than the other, typically about product quality. Symmetric information is when both parties have equal knowledge. Usually, the more knowledgeable party is the seller.
 
 
  In the case of  insurance , adverse selection is the tendency of those in dangerous jobs or high-risk lifestyles to purchase products like  life insurance . In these cases, it is the buyer who actually has more knowledge. To fight adverse selection, insurance companies reduce exposure to large claims by limiting coverage or raising premiums.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Adverse selection is when sellers have information that buyers do not have, or vice versa, about some aspect of product quality. It is the tendency of those in dangerous jobs or high-risk lifestyles to purchase life or disability insurance where chances are greater they will collect on it. A seller may also have better information than a buyer about products and services being offered, putting the buyer at a disadvantage in a transaction. Adverse selection can often be seen in the markets for used cars or insurance.

    Understanding Adverse Selection    
  Adverse selection occurs when one party in a negotiation has relevant information the other party lacks. The asymmetry of information often leads to poor decisions, such as the choice to do more business with less profitable or riskier  market segments .
 
 
  In the case of insurance, avoiding adverse selection requires identifying groups of people more at risk than the general population and charging them more money. For example, life insurance companies go through underwriting when evaluating whether to give an applicant a policy and what  premium  to charge.

   Underwriters  typically evaluate an applicant’s height, weight, current health, medical history, family history, occupation, hobbies, driving record, and lifestyle risks such as smoking. All these issues impact an applicant’s health and the company’s potential for paying a claim. The insurance company then determines whether to give the applicant a policy and what premium to charge for taking on that risk.
 
 
    Consequences of Adverse Selection    
  A seller may have better information than a buyer about products and services being offered, putting the buyer at a disadvantage in the transaction. For example, a company’s managers may more willingly issue shares when they know the share price is overvalued compared to the  real value ; buyers can end up buying overvalued shares and lose money. In the secondhand car market, a seller may know about a vehicle’s defect and charge the buyer more without disclosing the issue.
 
 
  The general consequence of adverse selection is that it increases costs since consumers lack information held by sellers or producers, creating an asymmetry in the market. This can also lower consumption as buyers may be wary of the quality of the products that are offered for sale.

 Definition 
 A yield curve is a graphical representation of yields over time; it is often depicted by plotting the yield of any given bond across different maturities in a given interval, perhaps by month. 
    What Is a Yield Curve?     
  A yield curve is a line that plots the yields or interest rates of bonds that have equal credit quality but different  maturity dates . The slope of the yield curve predicts the direction of interest rates and the economic expansion or contraction that could result. Yield curve rates are published on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website each trading day.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Yield curves plot the interest rates of bonds over time.  Very generally speaking, interest rates/yields should be higher in the long run (when risk is highest).  Normal curves point to economic expansion, while downward-sloping curves suggest economic recession. Yield curve rates are published on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website each trading day. 
 
    Using a Yield Curve    
  A  yield curve is a benchmark  for other debts in the market such as mortgage rates and bank lending rates. The yield curve can predict changes in economic output and growth over time. 
 
 
  The most frequently reported yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt.  Yield curve rates  are available on the Treasury's interest rate websites by 6:00 p.m. ET each trading day. 1 2 
 
 
  Some investors use the yield curve to make investment decisions based on the likely direction of bond rates. A visual representation of the curve is easy to build using an  Excel spreadsheet . 
 
 
    Types of Yield Curves    
  The three types of yield curves include normal, inverted, and flat.

    Normal Yield Curve    
  A normal yield curve shows low yields for shorter-maturity bonds increasing for bonds with a longer maturity. The curve slopes upward. This indicates that yields on longer-term bonds continue to rise, responding to periods of  economic expansion .
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 A normal yield curve implies stable economic conditions and a normal  economic cycle . A steep yield curve implies strong economic growth with conditions often accompanied by higher inflation and higher interest rates. 
 
 
 
  Sample yields on the curve can include a two-year bond that offers a yield of 1%, a five-year bond that offers a yield of 1.8%, a 10-year bond that offers a yield of 2.5%, a 15-year bond offers a yield of 3.0%, and a 20-year bond that offers a yield of 3.5%.
 
 
  Some bond investors will use a  roll-down return strategy  and sell a bond as it moves toward its maturity date. This strategy is also known as  riding the curve . It works in a stable rate environment as the bond's yield falls and the price rises. Investors hope to capture profit from the rise in bond prices.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    Inverted Yield Curve    
  An inverted yield curve slopes downward with short-term interest rates exceeding long-term rates. This type of curve corresponds to a period of economic recession when investors expect yields on longer-maturity bonds to trend lower in the future. 3

    What Is the Risk/Reward Ratio?    
  The risk/reward ratio—also known as the risk/return ratio—marks the prospective reward an investor can earn for every dollar they risk on an investment. Many investors use risk/reward ratios to compare the  expected returns  of an investment with the amount of risk they must undertake to earn these returns. A lower risk/return ratio is often preferable as it signals less risk for an equivalent potential gain.
 
 
  Consider the following example: an investment with a risk-reward ratio of 1:7 suggests that an investor is willing to risk $1, for the prospect of earning $7. Alternatively, a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 signals that an investor should expect to invest $1, for the prospect of earning $3 on their investment.
 
 
  Traders often use this approach to plan which trades to take, and the ratio is calculated by dividing the amount a trader stands to lose if the price of an asset moves in an unexpected direction (the risk) by the amount of profit the  trader  expects to have made when the position is closed (the reward).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The risk/reward ratio is used by traders and investors to manage their capital and risk of loss. The ratio helps assess the expected return and risk of a given trade. In general, the greater the risk, the greater the expected return demanded. An appropriate risk reward ratio tends to be anything greater than 1:3. 
 
    How the Risk/Reward Ratio Works    
  In many cases, market strategists find the ideal risk/reward ratio for their investments to be approximately 1:3, or three units of expected return for every one unit of additional risk. Investors can manage risk/reward more directly through the use of stop-loss orders and derivatives such as  put options .
 
 
  The risk/reward ratio is often used as a measure when trading individual stocks. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs widely among various trading strategies. Some trial-and-error methods are usually required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy, and many investors have a pre-specified risk/reward ratio for their investments.
 
 
  Note that the risk/return ratio can be computed as one's personal risk tolerance on an investment, or as the objective calculation of an investment's risk/return profile. In the latter case,  expected return  is often used in the denominator and potential loss in the numerator. Expected return can be computed in several ways, including projecting historical returns into the future, estimating the weighted probabilities of future outcomes, or using a model like the  capital asset pricing model  (CAPM).
 
 
 
 
  To estimate the potential loss, investors may use a variety of methods, such as analyzing historical price data with  technical analysis , using the historical  standard deviation  of price action, assessing company financial statements with  fundamental analysis , and models like  value-at-risk  (VaR). These methods can help investors identify factors that could impact the investment's value and estimate the potential downside.
 
 
   Tip 
 Estimating the expected return and potential loss is not an exact science, and the actual amount of risk and return may differ from your estimates. Investors should also consider their own risk tolerance when evaluating the potential risk of an investment, as the amount of risk they are willing to take on can vary depending on their personal circumstances and investment goals.

    What Is Wealth?    
  Wealth is the total value of all assets owned by a person, community, company, or country.
 
 
  It's measured by taking the  market value  of all  physical  and  intangible assets  owned, then subtracting all  debts . It can be seen in either absolute or relative terms.
 
 
   Building wealth  refers to the accumulation of scarce resources. People, organizations, and nations are said to be wealthy when they have accumulated many valuable resources or goods. Wealth can be contrasted with  income  in that wealth is a stock and income is a flow.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Wealth is an accumulation of valuable economic resources that can be measured in terms of either real goods or monetary value. Net worth is the most common measure of wealth, determined by taking the market value of all physical and intangible assets owned, then subtracting all debts. The concept of wealth is usually applied only to scarce economic goods; goods that are abundant and free for everyone provide no basis for relative comparisons across individuals. Unlike income, which is a flow variable, wealth measures the amount of valuable economic goods that have been accumulated at a given point in time. The relative differences in wealth between people are what we usually refer to in order to define who is wealthy or not. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi 
 
    Understanding Wealth    
  Wealth can be expressed in a variety of ways. In a purely material sense, wealth consists of all the real resources under one’s control. Financially,  net worth  is the most common expression of wealth.
 
 
  Definitions and  measures of wealth  have been different over time among societies. In modern society, money is the most common means of measuring wealth. Measuring wealth in terms of money is an example of money’s function as a  unit of account . The extent to which outside forces can manipulate the value of money can have a dramatic impact on measuring wealth in this way, but it provides a convenient common denominator for comparison.
 
 
 
 
  Otherwise, land and even livestock can be used to measure and evaluate wealth. The ancient Egyptians, for instance, once measured wealth based on wheat. Herding cultures have often used sheep, horses, or cattle as measures of wealth.
 
 
 
 
    How to Measure Wealth    
  Measuring wealth in terms of money overcomes the problem of evaluating wealth in the form of different kinds of goods. These values can then be added or subtracted together. This, in turn, permits the convenient use of net worth as a measure of wealth. Net worth is equal to assets minus liabilities. For businesses, net worth is also known as  shareholders’ equity  or  book value . In commonsense terms, net worth expresses wealth as all the real resources under one’s control, excluding those that ultimately belong to someone else.
 
 
  Wealth is a stock variable, as opposed to a flow variable like income. Wealth measures the amount of valuable economic goods accumulated at a given point in time; income measures the amount of money (or goods) obtained over a given interval of time. Income represents the addition to wealth over time (or subtraction, if it is negative).
 
 
  A person whose net income is positive over time will become increasingly wealthy over time. For countries,  gross domestic product (GDP)  can be thought of as a measure of income (a flow variable), though it is often erroneously referred to as a measure of wealth (a stock variable).
 
 
  Anyone who has accumulated a large quantity of net worth can be considered wealthy, but most people think of this term in more of a relative sense. Whether measured in terms of money and net worth, or in commodities like wheat or sheep, total wealth can vary among individuals and groups. The relative differences in wealth between people are what we usually refer to in order to define who is wealthy or not.
 
 
  Research has consistently shown that people’s perception of their own well-being and happiness depends much more on their estimates of wealth relative to other people than on absolute wealth. This is also part of why the concept of wealth is usually applied only to scarce economic goods; goods that are abundant and free for everyone provide no basis for relative comparisons across individuals.

Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) Overview,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 The Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) is the annual cap set by Canada on earnings eligible for contributions to the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan. 
    What Is Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE)?    
  The Canadian government sets the year's maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE) figure. The YMPE determines the maximum amount on which to base contributions to the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP). The YMPE specifies the  earnings  amount that can be used in calculating pension contributions for each year. 1 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The YMPE determines the maximum earnings amount for contributions to the CPP. 2 The maximum pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for 2022 are $64,900. 3 The size of those payments depends on an individual's earnings during their working years, the age an individual starts receiving their pension, and how much and for how long an individual contributes to the CPP. 4 
 
    Understanding Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE)    
   
The  Canada Pension Plan (CPP)  determines the maximum earnings amount for which contributions to the Canada Pension Plan can be made. According to the Government of Canada, the maximum pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for 2022 is $64,900—up from $61,600 in 2021. Contributors who earn more than $64,900 in 2022 cannot make additional contributions to the CPP. 3 
 
 
   Important 
 Beginning in 2024, a separate contribution rate will be implemented for earnings above the YMPE (expected to be 4% each for employers and employees). 5 
 
 
 
    Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings and CPP Contributions    
  The Canada Pension Plan is similar to the  Social Security  program in the United States. It provides workers with a series of monthly payments in retirement. 6  The size of those payments depends on an individual's earnings during their working years. 4 
 
 
  On June 20, 2016, Canada's ministers of finance agreed to augment the CPP. The deal increased how much working Canadians would receive from the CPP—from one-quarter of the employees' eligible earnings to one-third, with a boost to the earnings limit. Changes will be phased in gradually over seven years—from 2019 to 2025—so that the impact is measured and piecemeal. 5

   The income replacement level will be raised to one-third of employees' income. The upper earnings limit is set at $82,700 for 2025. There will be a gradual seven-year phase-in, starting on Jan. 1, 2019; this will consist of a five-year contribution rate phase-in below the yearly maximum pensionable earnings followed by a two-year phase-in of the upper earnings limit. The Working Income Tax Benefit will increase to help low-income earners. The enhanced part of employee CPP contributions will be tax-deductible.

  The higher contribution rate on earnings below the YMPE ($64,900 in 2022) will be phased-in over the first five years. In 2023, the CPP contribution rate, as estimated by the Department of Finance Canada, will be one percentage point higher for both employers and employees on earnings up to the YMPE. 3 5 
 
 
  In 2024, a separate contribution rate (expected to be 4% each for employers and employees) will be implemented for earnings above the YMPE at that time. 5

What Does an Investor Do? What Are the Different Types?,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is an Investor?    
  An investor is any person or other entity (such as a firm or  mutual fund ) who commits capital with the expectation of receiving financial returns. Investors rely on different financial instruments to earn a  rate of return  and accomplish important financial objectives like building retirement savings, funding a college education, or merely accumulating additional wealth over time.
 
 
  A  wide variety  of investment vehicles exist to accomplish goals, including (but not limited to) stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds,  exchange-traded funds  (ETFs), options, futures, foreign exchange, gold, silver, retirement plans, and real estate. Investors can analyze opportunities from different angles, and generally prefer to minimize risk while maximizing returns. 
 
 
  Investors typically generate returns by deploying capital as either equity or debt investments. Equity investments entail ownership stakes in the form of company stock that may pay dividends in addition to generating capital gains.  Debt investments  may be as loans extended to other individuals or firms, or in the form of purchasing bonds issued by governments or corporations which pay interest in the form of coupons.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Investors use different financial instruments to earn a rate of return to accomplish financial goals and objectives. Investments include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, derivatives, commodities, and real estate. Investors can be distinguished from traders in that investors take long-term strategic positions in companies or projects. Investors build portfolios either with an active orientation that tries to beat the benchmark index or a passive strategy that attempts to track an index. Investors may also be oriented toward either growth or value strategies. 
 
    Styles and Risk Tolerance    
  Investors are not a uniform bunch. They have varying  risk tolerances , capital, styles, preferences, and time frames. For instance, some investors may prefer very low-risk investments that will lead to conservative gains, such as certificates of deposits and certain bond products.
 
 
  Other investors, however, are more inclined to take on additional risk in an attempt to make a larger profit. These investors might invest in currencies, emerging markets, or stocks, all while dealing with a  roller coaster  of different factors on a daily basis. 
 
 
 
 
  Institutional investors are organizations such as financial firms or mutual funds that build sizable  portfolios  in stocks and other financial instruments. Often, they are able to accumulate and pool money from several smaller investors (individuals and/or firms) in order to make larger investments. Because of this, institutional investors often have far greater market power and influence over the markets than individual retail investors.
 
 
    Passive Investors vs. Active Investors    
  Investors may also adopt various market strategies.  Passive investors  tend to buy and hold the components of various market indexes and may optimize their allocation weights to certain asset classes based on rules such as  Modern Portfolio Theory's  (MPT) mean-variance optimization. Others may be stock pickers who invest based on fundamental analysis of corporate financial statements and financial ratios—these are active investors.
 
 
  One example of an  active approach  would be the ""value"" investors who seek to purchase stocks with low share prices relative to their book values. Others may seek to invest long-term in ""growth"" stocks that may be losing money at the moment but are growing rapidly and hold promise for the future.
 
 
  Passive (indexed) investing overtook active investment strategies in 2023 as the dominant stock market logic. 1  The growth of low-cost target-date mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and  robo-advisors  is partly responsible for this surge in popularity.
 
 
  Those interested in learning more about investing, passive and active investors, and other financial topics may want to consider enrolling in one of the best investing courses currently available.
 
 
   Important 
 Financial investments have the very specific goal of buying something that (hopefully) appreciates in value. Consider other forms of investing such as returning to school to complete your degree or embarking on a diet to ensure good health in the future. 
 
 
 
    Types of Investors    
    Angel Investors    
  An  angel investor  is a high-net-worth private individual who provides financial capital to a startup or entrepreneur. The capital is often provided in exchange for an equity stake in the company. Angel investors can provide a financial injection either once or on an ongoing basis. An angel investor typically provides capital in the early stages of a new business, when risk is high. They often use excess cash on hand to allocate towards high-risk investments.

What Is Diversification? Definition As an Investing Strategy,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Diversification is the strategy of investing in different asset classes and asset types to reduce portfolio risk associated with price volatility. 
    What Is Diversification?    
  Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to  limit exposure to any single asset or risk .
 
 
  The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk. Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency and then in different types of securities within a class. Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments. The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of assets. Investors can diversify on their own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds. 
 
    Understanding Diversification    
  Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness.
 
 
  Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the  negative performance  of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly  correlated —that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.
 
 
 
 
    Diversification Strategies    
  As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.

    Asset Classes    
  Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. Classes can include:
 
 
 
 Stocks : Shares or equity in a publicly traded company 
 Bonds : Government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments 
 Real estate : Land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits 
 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) : A marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector 
 Commodities : Basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services 
 Cash and short-term cash-equivalents (CCE) : Treasury bills, certificate of deposit (CD), money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments 
 
 
  The theory holds that what may negatively impact one asset class may benefit another. For example, rising interest rates usually negatively impact bond prices as yield must increase to make fixed income securities more attractive. On the other hand, rising interest rates may result in increases in rent for real estate or increases in prices for commodities.

    Industries/Sectors    
  There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk.
 
 
  For example, consider the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. 1  This legislation impacts many industries, though some companies are more affected than others.  Semiconductor  manufacturers will be largely impacted, while the financial services sector might feel smaller, residual impacts.
 
 
  Investors can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. For example, consider two major means of entertainment: travel and digital streaming. Investors hoping to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts may invest in digital streaming platforms (positively impacted by more shutdowns). At the same time, they may consider simultaneously investing","By

 Definition 
 A limit order is a buy or sell order for a stock or other asset that is executed automatically when the price reaches or exceeds a specified level. 
    What Is a Limit Order?    
  A limit order in the financial markets is an instruction to purchase or sell a stock or other security at a specified price or better. A limit can be placed on either a buy or a sell order:
 
 
   A buy limit order will be executed only at the limit price or lower. A sell limit order will be executed only at the limit price or higher. 
 
 
  Limit orders will be executed only if the price meets the order qualifications.
 
 
  The alternative to a limit order is a market order, which calls for a trade to be executed at the prevailing market price without any price limit specified.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A limit order guarantees that an order will be filled at the specified price or better. Limit orders are used with stop orders to prevent large downside losses. A limit order can be valid for a number of days, until the order is filled, or until the trader cancels the order. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   A limit order guarantees the price or better, but execution is not guaranteed. 
 Investopedia / Joules Garcia 
 
    How Limit Orders Work    
  A limit order allows traders to set a pre-determined price to buy or sell a  security . For example, imagine a trader who wants to buy stock in XYZ company, currently trading for $17.00. If the trader sets a limit buy order at $14.50, they will only buy the stock if the share price falls to $14.50 or lower.

  Conversely, the trader might have shares of XYZ’s stock and want to sell them if the price increases. The trader might set a limit sell order at $20, which will only sell the shares if the price rises to $20 or higher.
 
 
  By  using a buy limit order , the investor is guaranteed to pay the buy limit order price or better, but it is not guaranteed that the order will be filled. A limit order gives a trader more control over the  execution  price of a security, especially if they are fearful of using a  market order  during periods of heightened  volatility .
 
 
 
 
  Limit orders are useful when prices are rising or falling quickly, and the trader is worried about getting a bad fill from a market order. Additionally, a limit order can be useful if a trader is not watching a stock and has a specific price in mind at which they would be happy to buy or sell that security. Limit orders can also be left open with an expiration date.
 
 
    Limit Order Example    
  Imagine a portfolio manager who wants to buy Tesla Inc.'s ( TSLA ) stock but believes its current valuation at roughly $750 per share is too high. The manager would prefer to buy the stock at a lower price.
 
 
  The PM instructs his traders to buy 10,000 shares of Tesla should the price fall below $650,  good 'til canceled . The trader then places an order to buy 10,000 shares with a $650 limit. If the stock falls below that price, the limit order will automatically execute and buy up to 10,000 shares for $650 per share or lower. The order will remain open until the stock reaches the PM’s limit or the PM cancels the order.
 
 
  Additionally, the PM would like to sell Amazon.com Inc.'s ( AMZN ) stock but feels its current price of roughly $2,300 is too low. The PM instructs his trader to sell 5,000 shares should the price rise above $2,750, good until canceled. The trader will then place a limit sell order for 5,000 shares with a $2,750 limit.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Brokerage firms may not allow limit orders if they are illogical (i.e. if a limit to buy is placed at greater than price), Brokerage firms may also offer this service to investors for free. 
 
 
 
    Limit Orders vs. Market Orders    
  When an investor places an order to buy or sell a stock, there are two main execution options in terms of price: place the order ""at the market"" or ""at the limit.","0 seconds of 2 minutes, 43 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
What Is Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio? Example and Calculation,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio?    
  The total debt service (TDS) ratio—total debt obligation divided by gross income—is a financial  metric  that lenders use to determine whether or not to extend credit, primarily in the mortgage industry. To calculate the percentage of a prospective borrower's  gross income  already committed to debt obligations, lenders consider all required payments for both housing and non-housing bills.
 
 
  The housing factor in the TDS calculation includes everything paid for the home, from mortgage payment, real estate taxes, and  homeowners insurance  to association dues and utilities. The non-housing factor includes everything else, from auto loans, student loans, and credit card payments to child support and alimony. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The total debt service (TDS) ratio is a lending metric used by mortgage lenders to assess a borrower's capacity to take on a loan. The total debt service (TDS) ratio, unlike the gross debt service (GDS) ratio, includes both housing and non-housing debts and obligations. A TDS ratio below 43% is typically necessary to obtain a mortgage; many lenders are stricter—with benchmark TDS ratios closer to 36%. 
 
    How Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio Works    
  When applying for a  mortgage  or any other type of loan, all borrowers should be aware that the total debt service (TDS) ratio is a key factor driving approval or rejection—and it is just as important as a stable income, timely bill payment, and a strong  credit score .
 
 
  Remember, the lower your TDS ratio, the better your chances of approval. Borrowers with higher TDS ratios are more likely to struggle to meet their debt obligations than borrowers with lower ratios.
 
 
  All lenders will compare your TDS to their  benchmark  TDS range—usually from 36% to no more than 43%—before they decide whether you can manage an additional monthly payment on top of all other bills. Many lenders prefer a ratio of 36% or less for loan approval; most do not give mortgages to borrowers with TDS ratios that exceed 43%. 1 
 
 
   Important 
 Lenders prefer borrowers with total debt service (TDS) ratios of 36% or less; borrowers with TDS ratios that exceed 43% are rarely approved for mortgages. 
 
 
 
    Example of the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio    
  To see how your TDS ratio will be determined, just add up monthly debt  obligations  and divide them by gross monthly income. Here's a hypothetical example: an individual with a gross monthly income of $11,000 and monthly debt obligations of $4,225 ($2,225 for a mortgage; $1,000 for a student loan; $350 for a motorcycle loan; $650 for a credit card balance).
 
 
 
 
  Divide the total debt obligation of $4,225 by income of $11,000 (in the percentage formula below) to get a TDS ratio of 38.4%, which is not much higher than the low benchmark (36%) and well below the max (43%). This individual would most likely get a mortgage.
 
 
    How to Calculate Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio in Excel    
  The total debt service (TDS) ratio can also be calculated in Excel:
 
 
   Excel formula to calculate TDS ratio:  =SUM(debt/income)*100 In the example above (gross income of $11,000 and debt obligations of $4,225), the Excel formula would be:  =SUM(4225/11000)*100  (which equals 38.4%). 
 
 
    Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio vs. Gross Debt Service (GDS) Ratio    
  The total debt service (TDS) ratio is very similar to another debt-to-income ratio used by lenders—the  gross debt service  (GDS) ratio. The difference between TDS and GDS is that GDS does not factor any non-housing payments—such as credit card debts or car loans—into the equation.
 
 
  Because it reflects housing expenses only, the GDS ratio is also referred to as the  housing expense ratio . GDS may be used in other personal loan calculations, but it is most commonly used in the mortgage lending process. (You may also hear GDS referred to as Housing 1 ratio and TDS as Housing 2 ratio.) 
 
 
  In practice, the TDS ratio, the GDS ratio, and a borrower’s credit score are the key components analyzed in the  underwriting  process for a mortgage  loan . (Borrowers should generally strive for a GDS ratio of 28% or less.)
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Remember, there are several other factors in addition to the total debt service (TDS) and gross debt service (TDS) ratios that lenders take into consideration when determining whether to advance credit to certain borrowers.
 
 
  For instance, a small lender—one with less than $2 billion in  assets  and 500 or fewer mortgages in the past 12 months—may offer a qualified mortgage to a borrower with a TDS ratio exceeding 43%.
 
 
  Of course, all lenders consider credit histories and  credit scores . People with high credit scores tend to manage their debts more responsibly; they hold a reasonable amount of debt, make payments on time, and keep  account balances  low.
 
 
  Larger lenders may also be more likely to approve mor","By

Venture Capitalists: Who Are They and What Do They Do?,"Definition 
 A venture capitalist is a private equity investor who provides capital to companies with a high potential for growth in exchange for an equity stake. 
    What Is a Venture Capitalist?    
  A venture capitalist (VC) is an investor who funds companies with high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake in their eventual success. Most VC money goes to startup ventures preparing to go public or small privately owned companies with the potential to expand.
 
 
  Venture capital companies attract investment money from high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), insurance companies, pension funds, foundations, and corporate pension funds.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A venture capitalist (VC) is an investor or investment partnership that provides young companies with capital in exchange for equity. Startups turn to VCs for funding to scale up their businesses. Venture capitalists tend to experience high rates of failure but win massive returns for their rare successes. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Joules Garcia / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Venture Capitalists    
  Venture capital firms are usually formed as limited partnerships (LPs), with each partner contributing to the VC fund. A committee is generally tasked with making investment decisions. When a promising emerging growth company is identified, the firm agrees to fund it in exchange for a sizable equity stake.
 
 
  Contrary to common belief, VCs do not typically fund a startup in its earliest planning stages. They target firms that have a product and are generating revenue but need more money to commercialize their ideas.
 
 
  The VC fund will buy a stake in these firms, nurture their growth, and look to cash out with a strong  return on investment .

    What Venture Capitalists Look For    
  Venture capitalists typically look for companies with a strong management team, a large potential market, and a distinctive product or service with a solid competitive advantage.
 
 
 
 
  They tend to look for prospects in industries with which they are familiar or have expertise while having the chance to buy a large percentage of the company so they can influence its direction.
 
 
  VCs are willing to risk investing in such companies because they can earn a massive return on their investments if they are successful. However, VCs have high rates of failure because of the uncertainty involved with new and unproven companies.

 Venture capitalists can be involved in any of these stages, but are usually focused on the startup and growth stages, as we can see from the chart below of recent U.S. VC funding. 
 
 
 
 
    Venture Capital Structure    
  High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), insurance companies,  pension funds , foundations, and corporate pension funds may contribute money to a pool controlled by a VC firm. The venture capital firm acts as the general partner, managing the funds and choosing the investments, while the investors are limited partners (LPs). All partners have part ownership of the fund.
 
 
  The roles within a venture capital firm vary, but they can be broken down into roughly three positions:
 
 
   Associates : These individuals usually come to VC firms with experience in either business consulting or finance. They may analyze business models, industry trends, and sectors. They also work on a firm’s portfolio. Although they do not make critical decisions, associates may introduce promising companies to the firm’s upper management. Principals : A principal is a midlevel professional. They usually serve on the boards of portfolio companies and ensure that they run without significant hiccups. Principals are responsible for identifying prospects for VC firms and negotiating terms for acquisition and exit. Principals are on a partner track that depends on the returns they generate.  Partners : Higher-profile partners primarily identify areas or specific businesses to invest in, approve deals (whet",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapitalist.asp,Charlene Rhinehart,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
"Keogh Plan: Definition, Types, Pros, and Cons","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A Keogh plan is a tax-deferred retirement savings plan that is similar to a 401(k) plan but is designed for self-employed individuals. 
    What Is a Keogh Plan?    
  ""Keogh plan"" is a term used to describe qualified plans that cover  self-employed  people. This includes  defined-benefit plans and defined-contribution plans , though most plans are set as the latter. Contributions are generally tax-deductible up to a certain percentage of annual income, with applicable absolute limits in U.S. dollar terms, which the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  can change from year to year.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 ""Keogh plan"" is a term used to describe tax-deferred pension plans—either defined-benefit or defined-contribution—used by self-employed individuals. Keogh plans have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) or 401(k) plans, but the contribution limits are higher, making Keogh plans a popular option for many high-income business owners. Because current tax retirement laws do not set apart incorporated and self-employed plan sponsors, the term ""Keogh plan"" is rarely ever used. 
 
    Understanding Keogh Plans    
  Keogh plans are the same qualified plans other small businesses can use: the  defined-contribution plan , which includes profit-sharing plans and money purchase plans, and the  defined-benefit plan . However, the IRS calls them Keogh plans if they cover a self-employed individual. 1 
 
 
  Keogh plans can invest in the same set of securities as  401(k)s  and  individual retirement accounts (IRAs) , including stocks, bonds,  certificates of deposit  (CDs), and  annuities .
 
 
  The term comes from U.S. Representative Eugene Keogh, who was instrumental in passing the Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962. Because the act was passed to ensure that self-employed people had access to retirement plans, any plans designed for them became known as Keogh plans. However, the distinction between corporate and other retirement plan sponsors was removed when the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was passed. 2 
 
 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 As with other qualified retirement accounts, funds in a Keogh plan can be accessed as early as age 59½, and  withdrawals  must begin by age 73 or 75, depending on your birth year. 3 
 
 
 
    Types of Keogh Plans    
    Qualified Defined-Contribution Plans    
  Keogh plans can be set up as qualified defined-contribution plans, in which contributions are made on a regular basis up to a limit.  Profit-sharing plans  are one of the two types of Keogh plans that allow a business to contribute up to $69,000 as of 2024 ($66,000 in 2023). 4  A business does not have to generate profits to set aside money for this type of plan.

   Money purchase plans  are less flexible compared to profit-sharing plans and require a business to contribute a fixed percentage of its income every year that is specified in plan documents. If a company alters its fixed percentage, it may face penalties. The contribution limit for 2024 for money purchase plans is set at 25% of annual compensation or $69,000, whichever is lower. In 2023, it was $66,000 or 25% of annual compensation, whichever was lower. 4 
 
 
    Qualified Defined-Benefit Plans    
  Qualified defined-benefit plans state the annual benefits to be received at retirement, and these benefits are typically based on salary and years of employment. Contributions towards defined-benefit Keogh plans are based on stated benefits and other factors, such as age and expected returns on plan assets. For 2024, the maximum annual benefit is $275,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is lower. For 2023, it was $265,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever was lower. 5 4 
 
 
    Pros and Cons of Keogh Plans    
  Keogh plans have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than  Simplified Employee Pension  (SEP) IRAs or 401(k) plans.
 
 
  The key advantage to Keogh plans is that they have higher contribution limits, making them a popular option for many high-income business owners.
 
 
   What Is the Difference Between a Keogh and an IRA? 
 Keogh plans are designed for self-employed people. While self-employed people can contribute to an IRA, Keogh plans have much higher contribution limits. 
 
 
   Who Is Eligible for a Keogh Plan? 
 Keogh plans are for self-employed people, so you can enroll in one if you're a sole proprietor, freelancer, or work for yourself.

"Fixed-Rate Payment: What it is, How it Works, Example","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A fixed-rate payment is a type of loan installment where the interest rate remains constant throughout the loan's term. 
    What Is a Fixed-Rate Payment?    
  A fixed-rate payment is an  installment loan  with an interest rate that cannot be changed during the life of the loan. The payment amount also will remain the same, though the proportions that go toward paying off the interest and paying off the principal will vary. 1 ﻿ A fixed-rate payment is sometimes referred to as a “vanilla wafer” payment, presumably because it is very predictable and contains no surprises.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 In a fixed-rate payment, the total amount due remains the same throughout the life of the loan, although the proportion that goes to interest and principal varies. The fixed-rate payment most often refers to mortgage loans. The borrower must decide between a fixed-rate payment and an adjustable-rate payment. Banks generally offer a variety of fixed-rate payment mortgage loans, each with a slightly different interest rate. 
 
    How a Fixed-Rate Payment Works    
  A fixed-rate payment agreement is most often used in mortgage loans. Homebuyers generally have a choice of  fixed-rate mortgage loans  or  adjustable-rate (ARM) mortgage loans . Adjustable-rate mortgage loans are also known as  floating  rate loans. Homebuyers typically can decide  which loan type is the better choice  for them.
 
 
  A bank will generally offer a variety of fixed-rate payment mortgage loans, each with a slightly different interest rate. Typically, a homebuyer can choose a  15-year term or a 30-year term . 2 ﻿ Slightly lower rates are offered for veterans and for Federal Housing Authority (FHA) loans. Although loans for veterans and those available through the FHA have lower interest rates, borrowers are typically required to purchase additional mortgage insurance to protect against default. 3 ﻿
 
 
  Banks also offer options for adjustable-rate loans. Historically, these could have a substantially lower starting interest rate than fixed-rate payment loans. In times when interest rates were low, the homebuyer could usually get an even lower introductory rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage, offering a break on the payments in the months immediately after the purchase. When the introductory period ended, the bank raised the rate and the payment amounts as interest rates were rising. When interest rates were high, a bank was more inclined to offer the introductory rate break on fixed-rate loans, because it anticipated that rates on new loans will go lower.
 
 
 
 
  However, with mortgage rates hovering below 5% since the 2008 housing crisis, the gap between  fixed-rate and variable-rate loans  has practically closed. As of Aug. 13, 2020, the average interest rate nationwide on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 2.96%. The rate for a comparable adjustable-rate loan was 2.9%. 4 ﻿ The latter is a so-called “5/1 ARM,” meaning the rate remains fixed for at least five years. After five years, it may be adjusted upward annually. 5 ﻿
 
 
   0.06% 
 The difference between the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and the average rate for a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage 
 
    Special Considerations    
  The amount paid for a fixed-rate payment loan remains the same month after month, but the proportions that go to pay off principal and interest change every month. The earliest payments are made up of more interest than principal. Month by month, the amount of interest paid declines gradually while the principal paid increases. This is called loan  amortization . 6 ﻿
 
 
    Example of a Fixed-Rate Payment Loan    
  The term is used in the home loan industry to refer to payments under a fixed-rate mortgage which are indexed on a common amortization chart. For example, the first few lines of an amortization schedule for a $250,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 4.5% interest rate look like the table below.

 Definition 
 In a knowledge economy, products and services are mainly based on knowledge-related activities, rather than physical assets and labor. 
    What Is the Knowledge Economy?    
  The knowledge economy is an economy of products and services produced with human capital—knowledge, skills, and intellectual property—rather than physical assets such as land and physical labor.
 
 
  It refers to the ability to capitalize on scientific discoveries and applied research.
 
 
  The knowledge economy represents a large share of the activity in most highly  developed economies .
 
 
  A significant component of its value might be  intangible assets , such as the value of its workers' knowledge or of intellectual property such as patents and proprietary procedures.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The knowledge economy describes the contemporary commercialization of science and academic scholarship. Innovation based on research is commodified via patents and other forms of intellectual property. The knowledge economy lies at the intersection of private entrepreneurship, academia, and government-sponsored research. Knowledge-related fields and industries represent a large share of the activity in most highly developed countries. A knowledge economy depends on skilled labor and education, strong communications networks, and institutional structures that motivate innovation. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Tara Anand 
 
    Understanding the Knowledge Economy    
  Developing economies tend to be heavily focused on agriculture and manufacturing, which involve physical resources.
 
 
 
 
  Highly developed countries have a larger share of service-related activities. The latter include knowledge-based economic activities such as research, technical support, and consulting.
 
 
  The knowledge economy is the marketplace for the production and sale of scientific and engineering discoveries.
 
 
  This knowledge can be commodified in the form of  patents  or other  intellectual property  protections. The producers of this information, such as scientific experts, research labs, and technology developers, are also considered to be part of the knowledge economy. 
 
 
    Growth    
  The world economy has become more knowledge-based thanks to globalization, which can reveal the best practices of each country's economy.
 
 
  Knowledge-based factors also create an interconnected and global economy where human expertise and trade secrets are considered important economic assets and resources.
 
 
   Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)  don't allow companies to include these assets on their balance sheets, however.
 
 
   Important 
 The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was a major turning point in the treatment of intellectual property in the United States. It allowed universities to retain title to inventions or discoveries made with federal R&D funding and to negotiate exclusive licenses. 1 
 
 
 
    Knowledge Economy and Human Capital    
  The knowledge economy reflects the way that education, knowledge, and  human capital  can serve as productive assets or business products to be sold and exported to yield profits for individuals, businesses, and the economy.
 
 
    Intellectual vs. Physical    
  This component of the economy relies heavily on intellectual capabilities rather than on natural resources or physical contributions.

"Guarantor: Definition, Example, and Responsibilities","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A guarantor is an individual or entity who promises to pay a debt if the main party defaults. They act as a backup source of payment if the borrower can’t cover the debt. 
    What Is a Guarantor?    
  “Guarantor” is a financial term describing an individual who promises to pay a borrower’s debt if the borrower defaults on their loan obligation. Guarantors  pledge their own assets  as collateral against the loans. On rare occasions, individuals act as their own guarantors, by pledging their own assets against the loan.
 
 
  The term “guarantor” is often interchanged with the term “surety.”
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 
 A guarantor guarantees to pay a borrower’s debt if the borrower defaults on a loan obligation. 
 The guarantor guarantees a loan by pledging their assets as  collateral . 
 A guarantor alternatively describes someone who verifies the identity of an individual attempting to land a job or secure a passport. 
 Unlike a co-signer, a guarantor has no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower. 
 If the borrower defaults on their loan, then the guarantor is liable for the outstanding obligation, which they must meet; otherwise, legal action may be brought against them. 
 
 
    Understanding a Guarantor    
  A guarantor is typically over the age of 18 and  resides in the country  where the payment agreement occurs. Guarantors generally exhibit exemplary  credit histories  and sufficient  income  to cover the loan payments if and when the borrower  defaults , at which time the guarantor’s  assets  may be seized by the lender. And if the borrower chronically makes payments late, the guarantor may be on the hook for additional  interest  owed or penalty costs.
 
 
    Types of Guarantors    
  There are many different scenarios in which a guarantor would need to be used. This ranges from assisting people with poor credit histories to simply assisting those without a high-enough income. Guarantors also don’t necessarily need to be liable for the entire monetary obligation in the guarantee. Below are different situations that would require a guarantor, as well as the type of guarantor in a specific guarantee.
 
 
 
 
    Guarantors as Certifiers    
  In addition to pledging their assets as collateral against loans, guarantors may also help individuals land jobs and secure passport documents. In these situations, guarantors certify that they personally know the applicants and corroborate their identities by confirming photo IDs.
 
 
    Limited vs. Unlimited    
  As defined under the terms of the loan agreement, a guarantor can either be limited or unlimited concerning timetables and levels of financial involvement. Case in point: A limited guarantor may be asked to guarantee a  loan  only up to a certain time, after which the borrower alone assumes responsibility for the remaining payments and suffers the consequences of defaulting.
 
 
  A limited guarantor may also only be responsible for backing a certain percentage of the loan, referred to as a penal sum. This differs from unlimited guarantors, who are liable for the entire amount of the loan throughout the entire duration of the contract.
 
 
    Other Contexts for Guarantors    
  Guarantors aren’t solely used by borrowers with poor credit histories. Pointedly, landlords frequently require first-time property renters to provide lease guarantors. This commonly occurs with college students whose parents assume the role of the guarantor, in case the tenant is unable to make the rent or prematurely breaks the  lease  agreement.
 
 
    Guarantors vs. Co-signers    
  A guarantor differs from a  co-signer , who co-owns the asset, and whose name appears on titles. Co-signer arrangements typically occur when the borrower’s qualifying income is less than the figure stipulated in the lender’s requirement. This differs from guarantors, who step in only when borrowers have sufficient income but are thwarted by lousy credit histories. Co-signers share ownership of an asset, while guarantors have no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower.
 
 
  However, in the event the borrower has a claim against a third party that has caused the default, the guarantor has the right to invoke a process called  subrogation  (“step into the shoes of the borrower”) to recover damages.
 
 
  For example, in a rental agreement, a co-signer would be responsible for the rent from day one, whereas a guarantor would only be responsible for the rent if the renter fails to make a payment. This also applies to any loan. Guarantors are only notified when the borrower defaults, not for any payment before that.
 
 
   Important 
 In the event of a default, the guarantor’s credit history may be adversely affected, which may limit their chances of securing loans in the future. 
 
 
 
  In essence, a co-signer takes on more financial responsibility than a guarantor does, as  a co-signer is equally responsible  from the onset of the agreement, whereas a guara","By

Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP): Definition and Rules,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)?    
  A qualified institutional placement (QIP) is, at its core, a way for listed companies to raise capital without having to submit legal paperwork to market regulators. It is common in India and other Southeast Asian countries.
 
 
  The  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)  created the rule to avoid the dependence of companies on foreign capital resources.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Qualified institutional placements (QIPs) are a way to issue shares to the public without going through standard regulatory compliance. QIPs instead follow a looser set of regulations but where allottees are more highly regulated. The practice is mostly used in India and other Southeast Asian countries. QIPs were created to avoid dependency on foreign resources for raising capital. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) are the only entities allowed to purchase QIPs. 
 
    How a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) Works    
  A qualified institutional placement (QIP) was initially a designation of a  securities  issue given by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The QIP allows an Indian-listed company to raise capital from domestic markets without the need to submit any pre-issue filings to market regulators. The SEBI limits companies to only raising money through issuing securities.
 
 
  The SEBI put forth the guidelines for this unique avenue of Indian  financing  on May 8, 2006. The primary reason for developing QIPs was to keep India from depending too much on foreign capital to fund its economic growth.
 
 
  Before the QIP, there was a growing concern from Indian regulators that its domestic companies were accessing international funding too readily via  American depositary receipts (ADRs) ,  foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) , and  global depositary receipts (GDRs) , rather than by Indian-based capital sources. Authorities proposed the QIP guidelines to encourage Indian companies to raise funds domestically instead of tapping into overseas markets.
 
 
  QIPs are helpful for a few reasons. Their use saves time as the issuance of QIPs and the access to capital are far quicker than through a  follow-on public offer (FPO) . The speed is because QIPs have far fewer legal rules and regulations to follow, making them much more cost-efficient. Further, there are fewer legal fees, and there is no cost of listing overseas.
 
 
 
 
  In India, 20 firms together raised 18.443 billion rupees ($221 billion) through QIPs in the first half of  fiscal year  2024. 1 
 
 
    Regulations for a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)    
  To be allowed to raise  capital  through a QIP, a firm must be listed on a  stock exchange  along with the minimum shareholding requirements as specified in their listing agreement. Also, the company must issue at least 10% of its issued securities to mutual funds or  allottees .
 
 
  Regulations also exist for the number of allottees on a QIP, depending on the specific factors within an issue. Additionally, no single allottee is allowed to own more than 50% of the total debt issue. Furthermore, allottees must not be related in any way to promoters of the issue. Several more regulations dictate who may or may not receive QIP securities issues.
 
 
    Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs) and Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs)     
  The only parties eligible to purchase QIPs are  qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) , which are accredited investors, as defined by whatever securities and exchange governing body preside over it. This limitation is due to the perception that QIBs are institutions with expertise and financial power that allows them to evaluate and participate in capital markets, at that level, without the legal assurances of a follow-on public offer (FPO).
 
 
   Who Created the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)? 
 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) created the qualified institutional placement (QIP). The purpose was to avoid the dependence of companies on foreign capital resources. 
 
 
   What Are the Advantages of QIPs? 
 The use of QIPs saves time because the issuance of QIPs and the access to capital are far quicker than through a follow-on public offer (FPO). QIPs have far fewer legal rules and regulations to follow, making them not only faster but also more cost-efficient. Additionally, there are fewer legal fees and no cost of listing overseas. 
 
 
   What Are the Disadvantages of QIPs? 
 The disadvantages of QIPs include: 2 A limited  investor  base Market dependency 3 Potential stake  dilution The risk of  underpricing 
 
 
    The Bottom Line    
  Qualified institutional placements (QIPs) are a way for listed companies to raise capital without having to submit legal paperwork to market regulators. They follow a looser set of regulations, but in return, allottees are more highly regulated. QIPs are used mostly in India and other Southeast Asian","By

"Economics Defined With Types, Indicators, and Systems","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Economics studies how societies manage scarce resources to produce, distribute, and consume goods and services. It is a social science. 
    What Is Economics?    
  Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The study of economics is primarily concerned with analyzing the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make to allocate limited resources.
 
 
  Economics has ramifications on a wide range of other fields, including politics, psychology, business, and law.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Economics is the study of how people allocate scarce resources for production, distribution, and consumption, both individually and collectively. The field of economics is connected with many others and has ramifications on them, such as politics, government, law, and business. The two branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics. Economics focuses on efficiency in production and exchange. Gross domestic product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are two of the most widely used economic indicators. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Zoe Hansen / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Economics    
  Assuming humans have unlimited wants within a world of limited means, economists analyze how resources are allocated for production, distribution, and consumption.
 
 
  The study of  microeconomics  focuses on the choices of individuals and businesses, and  macroeconomics  concentrates on the behavior of the economy on an aggregate level.
 
 
  One of the earliest recorded economists was eighth century B.C. Greek farmer and poet Hesiod, who wrote that labor, materials, and time needed to be allocated efficiently to overcome scarcity. The publication of  Adam Smith ’s 1776 book “An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” sparked the beginning of the current Western contemporary economic theories. 1

    Microeconomics    
  Microeconomics studies how individual consumers and firms make decisions to allocate resources. Whether a single person, a household, or a business, economists may analyze how these entities respond to changes in price and why they demand what they do at particular price levels.
 
 
  Microeconomics analyzes how and why goods are valued differently, how individuals make financial decisions, and how they trade, coordinate, and cooperate.
 
 
  Within the dynamics of supply and demand, the costs of producing goods and services, and how labor is divided and allocated, microeconomics studies how businesses are organized and how individuals approach uncertainty and risk in their decision making.
 
 
    Macroeconomics    
  Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. Its primary focus is recurrent  economic cycles  and broad economic growth and development.
 
 
  It focuses on foreign trade, government fiscal and monetary policy, unemployment rates, the level of inflation, interest rates, the growth of total production output, and  business cycles  that result in expansions, booms, recessions, and depressions.
 
 
  Using aggregate indicators, economists use macroeconomic models to help formulate economic policies and strategies. 
 
 
    What Is the Role of an Economist?    
  An  economist  studies the relationship between a society’s resources and its production or output, and their opinions help shape economic policies related to interest rates, tax laws, employment programs, international trade agreements, and corporate strategies.
 
 
  Economists analyze economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to identify potential trends or make economic forecasts.
 
 
  According to the U.S.  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) , 41% of all economists in the United States work for a federal or state agency. Economists are also employed as consultants, professors, by corporations, or as part of economic think tanks. 2 
 
 
    What Are Economic Indicators?

"Goodwill (Accounting): What It Is, How It Works, and How To Calculate","What Is Goodwill?    
  Goodwill in business is an  intangible asset  that's recorded when one company is purchased by another. It's the portion of the purchase price that's higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process.
 
 
  This difference is due to issues such as the value of a company’s name, brand reputation, loyal customer base, solid customer service, good employee relations, and proprietary technology. Goodwill represents a value that can give the acquiring company a competitive advantage. It's one of the reasons that one company may pay a premium for another.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Goodwill is an intangible asset that accounts for the excess purchase price of another company. Goodwill includes proprietary or intellectual property, brand recognition, and other aspects of a company that are valuable but not easily quantifiable. It's calculated by taking the purchase price of a company and subtracting the difference between the fair market value of the assets and liabilities. Companies are required to review   the value of goodwill on their financial statements at least once a year and record any impairments. Goodwill has an indefinite life. Most   other intangible assets have a finite   useful life. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Lara Antal 
 
    Understanding Goodwill    
  The value of goodwill typically comes into play when one company acquires another. A company's tangible value is the fair value of its net assets but the purchasing company may pay more than this price for the target company. This difference is usually due to the value of the target’s goodwill.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 A company gains negative goodwill, also known as badwill, if the acquiring company pays less than the target’s book value. It purchased the company at a bargain in a distress sale. 
 
 
 
  Goodwill is recorded as an intangible asset on the acquiring company's balance sheet under the long-term  assets account . It's considered to be an intangible or non-current asset because it's not a physical asset such as buildings or equipment.
 
 
 
 
  Companies are required under  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to evaluate the value of goodwill on their financial statements at least once a year and record any impairments. 1

   Important 
 Goodwill isn't the same as other intangible assets. It's the premium paid over fair value during a transaction and it can't be bought or sold independently. Other intangible assets such as licenses or patents can be. Goodwill has an indefinite life. Other intangibles have a finite useful life. 
 
 
 
    Goodwill Impairments    
  Accounting goodwill involves the  impairment  of assets that occurs when the market value of an asset drops below  historical cost . This can occur as the result of an adverse event such as:
 
 
   Declining cash flows Increased competitive environment Economic depression 
 
 
  The company must impair or do a  write-down  on the value of the asset on the balance sheet if a company assesses that acquired net assets fall below the book value or if the amount of goodwill was overstated. The impairment expense is calculated as the difference between the current market value and the purchase price of the intangible asset.
 
 
  The impairment results in a decrease in the goodwill account on the balance sheet. The expense is also recognized as a loss on the income statement. This directly reduces net income for the year.  Earnings per share  (EPS) and the company's stock price are also negatively affected. 
 
 
    Impairment Tests    
  Companies assess whether an impairment exists by performing an impairment test on an intangible asset. The two commonly used methods for testing impairments are the income approach and the market approach.
 
 
   Income approach : Estimated future cash flows are discounted to the present value. Market approach : Assets and liabilities of similar companies operating in the same industry are analyzed. 
 
 
    Calculating Goodwill    
  The process for calculating goodwill is fairly straightforward in principle but it can be complex in practice. You can determine goodwill with a simple formula by taking the purchase price of a company and subtracting the net  fair market value  of identifiable assets and liabilities. 
 Goodwill = P − (  A  −  L  ) where: P = Purchase price of the target company A = Fair market value of assets L = Fair market value of liabilities \begin{aligned}&\text{Goodwill} = \text{P} - ( \text{ A } - \text { L } ) \\&\textbf{where:} \\&\t",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
Hurdle Rate: What It Is and How Businesses and Investors Use It,"Definition 
 A hurdle rate is the minimum required return on an investment or project to be deemed acceptable, typically adjusted for risk. 
    What Is a Hurdle Rate?    
  A hurdle rate is the lowest rate of return a project or investment must achieve before a manager or investor deems it acceptable. It's important when companies or investors make important decisions like pursuing a specific project. Riskier projects generally have higher hurdle rates than those with less risk. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A hurdle rate is the minimum rate of return required on a project or investment. Hurdle rates give companies clarity about whether they should pursue a specific project. Generally, the higher the risk, the higher the hurdle rate. Investors use a hurdle rate in a discounted cash flow analysis to determine an investment's value and assess its worth. Companies sometimes use their weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the hurdle rate. Private equity and hedge funds also use a hurdle rate, which measures when general partners (GPs) are entitled to performance fees. 
 
  The term is also often used in private equity investing and hedge fund management. For example, in a private equity investment fund, the general partner (GP) can only charge performance fees (known as carried interest) if the limited partner's rate of return crosses the prearranged hurdle rate.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Sydney Burns 
 
    Hurdle Rate Factors    
  The hurdle rate balances the need for profit with the risks and costs involved. This concept is crucial in guiding individual and corporate investment strategy decisions.
 
 
  When determining the hurdle rate, several key factors are taken into account:
 
 
 
 
 
 Risk premium : This part of the hurdle rate accounts for the level of risk associated with the investment. Higher-risk projects typically demand higher risk premiums, reflecting the extra returns investors require to compensate for the increased risk. The risk premium is often calculated based on the industry, market volatility, and the specific risks of the project. 
 Inflation rate :  Inflation  can erode the value of returns over time. The expected inflation rate during the investment period should be considered when setting the hurdle rate. Including the inflation rate ensures that the return on the investment exceeds the nominal cost of capital and keeps pace with the rising cost of goods and services. 
 Interest rate : Interest rates, often reflected in the cost of debt, are another critical part, representing the cost of borrowing money. For investments funded through debt, the interest rate on the borrowed capital forms a baseline for the hurdle rate since the investment must generate enough return to cover this cost.

 Cost of capital : This is broader, comprising equity and debt financing costs. The cost of capital reflects the return that equity owners and lenders expect on the funds they spend. Calculating the cost of capital often involves weighing the cost of debt (with the interest rate) and the cost of equity, which can be trickier to estimate and usually includes the risk premium. 
 Expected rate of return : The hurdle rate must be above the overall return expected from the investment. If the projected return on investment (ROI) is below the hurdle rate, it may be deemed too risky or not profitable enough to pursue. 
 
 
    What Does the Hurdle Rate Tell You?    
  Hurdle rates are important, especially when calculating the potential success of future endeavors and projects. Companies determine whether they will take on a capital project based on its risk level.
 
 
  If an expected rate of return is above the hurdle rate, the investment is considered sound. If the rate of return falls below the hurdle rate, management may choose not to move forward. A hurdle rate is also called the  break-even yield . 
 
 
    How to Use Hurdle Rate    
  Investors and businesses use hurdle rates to evaluate an investment or project's potential.
 
 
    Investing    
  Investors look at the  risk premium  for a potential investment since it captures the anticipated amount of risk involved. The higher the risk, the higher the risk premium should be. Risk premiums are typically added to the WACC for a more realistic hurdle rate.
 
 
  Using a hurdle rate to determine an investment's potential helps to take our feelings or preferences for it out of the equation. By assigning a realistic risk factor, an investor can use the hurdle rate to assess whether the project has financial merit despite its intrinsic value.

    What Is a Tariff?    
  Most countries are limited by their natural resources and ability to produce certain goods and services. They trade with other countries to get what their population needs and demands. However, trade isn't always conducted in an amenable manner between trading partners. Policies, geopolitics, competition, and many other factors can make trading partners unhappy.
 
 
  One of the ways governments deal with trading partners they disagree with is through tariffs. A tariff is a  tax imposed  by one country on the goods and services imported from another country to influence it, raise revenues, or protect competitive advantages.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Governments impose tariffs to raise revenue, protect domestic industries, or exert political leverage over another country. Tariffs often result in unwanted side effects, such as higher consumer prices. Tariffs have a long and contentious history, and the debate over whether they represent good or bad policy still rages.

    Understanding Tariffs    
  Tariffs are used to restrict  imports . Simply put, they increase the price of goods and services purchased from another country, making them less attractive to domestic consumers.
 
 
  A key point to understand is that a tariff affects the exporting country because consumers in the country that imposed the tariff might shy away from imports due to the price increase. However, if the consumer still chooses the imported product, then the tariff has essentially raised the cost of the imported product for the consumer.
 
 
  There are two types of tariffs:

 A specific tariff is levied as a fixed fee based on the type of item, such as a $500 tariff on a car. 
 An  ad-valorem  tariff is levied based on the item's value, such as 5% of an import's value. 
 
 
 
 
    Why Governments Impose Tariffs    
  Governments may impose tariffs for several reasons:
 
 
   To raise revenues To protect domestic industries To protect domestic consumers To protect national interests 
 
 
    Raising Revenue    
  Tariffs can be used to raise revenues for governments. This kind of tariff is called a revenue tariff and is not designed to restrict imports. For instance, in 2018 and 2019, President Donald Trump and his administration imposed tariffs on many items to rebalance the trade deficit. In the fiscal year 2018, customs duties received were $41.6 billion. In fiscal year 2019, duties received were $71.9 billion. 1 2 
 
 
    Protecting Domestic Industries    
  Governments can use tariffs to benefit particular industries, often doing so to protect companies and jobs. For example, in April 2018, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on steel articles from all countries except Canada and Mexico. 3  In March 2022, President Joe Biden replaced the tariff on steel products from the United Kingdom with a tariff-rate quota of 500,000 metric tons, and reached quota deals with several other countries. 4 5 
 
 
  This proclamation reopened the trade of specific items with the U.K. while taking measures to protect domestic U.S. steel manufacturing and production jobs.

"What Is the Kyoto Protocol? Definition, History, Timeline, and Status","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the Kyoto Protocol?    
  The Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce  carbon dioxide  emissions and the presence of  greenhouse gases  (GHG) in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol was that industrialized nations needed to reduce their CO2 emissions. The protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, as greenhouse gas emissions threatened climate stability. 1  It was effectively replaced by the Paris Agreement, which went into effect in 2016. 2 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that called for industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly. Other accords, like the Doha Amendment, also aimed to compel countries to mobilize against the climate crisis. The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 replaced the Kyoto Protocol and included commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to reduce their climate-altering pollution. In 2020, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on the grounds that the mandate was unfair and would hurt the U.S. economy. It rejoined the accord in 2021 and left again in 2025. 
 
    Understanding the Kyoto Protocol    
  The Kyoto Protocol mandated that  industrialized nations  cut their greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the threat of global warming was growing rapidly. The Protocol was linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on Dec. 11, 1997, and became international law on Feb. 16, 2005. 1 
 
 
  Countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol were assigned maximum carbon emission levels for specific periods and participated in  carbon credit trading . If a country emitted more than its assigned limit, then it would be penalized by receiving a lower emissions limit in the   following period.
 
 
  Developed, industrialized countries made a promise under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their annual  hydrocarbon  emissions by an average of 5.2% by the year 2012. 3  Targets depended on the individual country. As a result, each nation had a different target to meet by that year. Members of the  European Union (EU)  pledged to cut emissions by 8%, while the U.S. and Canada promised to reduce their emissions by 7% and 6%, respectively, by 2012. 4 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 The amount of the Kyoto Protocol fund that was meant to aid developing countries in selecting industrialized processes and technologies that did not emit GHGs. 5 
 
 
 
    Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms    
  The Kyoto Protocol established three different mechanisms to enable countries to meet their targeted emissions limits. The three mechanisms were:
 
 
 
 The International Emissions Trading Mechanism : Countries that had excess emission units permitted to them but did not use them could engage in  carbon trading  and sell these units to countries that were over-target. 6 
 The Clean Development Mechanism:  Countries with emissions reduction or limiting commitments could implement reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified credits. 
 The Joint Implementation Mechanism:  Countries with emissions reduction or limiting commitments could earn emission-reducing units from a project implemented in conjunction with another party. 7 
 
 
    Responsibilities of Developed vs. Developing Nations    
  The Kyoto Protocol recognized that developed countries are principally responsible for the high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity. 8  As such, the protocol placed a heavier burden on developed nations compared to less-developed nations.
 
 
  The Kyoto Protocol mandated that 37 industrialized nations and the EU cut their GHG emissions. 9  Developing nations were asked to comply voluntarily, and more than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the Kyoto agreement altogether. 10 
 
 
    A Particular Function for Developing Countries    
  The protocol separated countries into two groups: Annex I contained developed nations, and Non-Annex I referred to developing countries. The protocol placed emission limitations on Annex I countries only. Non-Annex I nations participated by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries. 11 
 
 
  For these projects, developing countries earned  carbon credits , which they could trade or sell to developed countries, allowing the developed nations a higher level of maximum carbon emissions for that period. In effect, this function helped the developed countries to continue emitting GHG vigorously. 6 
 
 
    U.S. Involvement    
  The U.S., which ratified the original Kyoto Protocol, dropped out of the protocol in 2001. The U.S. believed that the agreement was unfair because it called only for industrialized nations to limit emissions reductions, and it felt that doing so would hurt the U.S. economy. 12

 Definition 
 A yield spread is the difference between the quoted rates of return of two different debt instruments. 
    What Is a Yield Spread?    
  A yield spread is the difference between yields on differing debt instruments of varying maturities, credit ratings, issuers, or risk levels. A yield spread is calculated by deducting the yield of one instrument from the other. This difference is most often expressed in  basis points (bps)  or percentage points. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A yield spread is the difference between the quoted rate of return on different debt instruments that have different characteristics. The spread is straightforward to calculate since you subtract the yield of one from that of the other in terms of percentage or basis points. Yield spreads are often quoted in terms of a yield versus U.S. Treasuries or a yield versus AAA-rated corporate bonds. When yield spreads expand or contract, it can signal changes in the underlying economy or financial markets. Yield spreads can come in varying types, including zero-volatility spreads, high-yield bond spreads, and option-adjusted spreads. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Ellen Lindner 
 
    How Yield Spreads Work    
  The yield spread is a key metric that bond investors use when gauging the level of expense for a bond or group of bonds. If one bond yields 7% and another one yields 4%, the spread is three percentage points or 300 bps. Non-Treasury bonds are generally evaluated based on the  difference between their yield and that of a Treasury bond  of comparable maturity.
 
 
  Yield spreads are commonly quoted in terms of one yield versus that of U.S. Treasuries, where it is called the  credit spread . For example, if the five-year  Treasury bond  is at 5% and the 30-year Treasury bond is at 6%, the yield spread between the two debt instruments is 1%. If the 30-year bond is trading at 6%, then based on the historical yield spread, the five-year bond should be trading at around 1%, making it very attractive at its  current yield  of 5%. 
 
 
  Because  bond yields  often change, yield spreads change, too:
 
 
 
 
   The direction of the spread may increase or widen, meaning the yield difference between the two bonds increases, and one sector performs better than another. When spreads narrow, the yield difference decreases and one sector performs more poorly than another. 
 
 
  Let's say   the yield on a high-yield bond index increases to 7.5% from 7%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield remains at 2%. The spread moved from 500 basis points to 550 basis points (the difference between the bond and the 10-year U.S. Treasury), which indicates that high-yield bonds underperformed Treasuries during that period. 
 
 
   Important 
 Yield spreads can be used to help predict  recessions  and economic recoveries, and may indicate how investors view economic conditions. Widening spreads typically lead to a positive yield curve, indicating stable economic conditions in the future. But when falling spreads contract, worsening economic conditions may be coming, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. 
 
 
 
    Yield Spread vs. Credit Spread    
  A bond credit spread reflects the difference in yield between a treasury and corporate bond of the same maturity. Debt issued by the United States Treasury is used as the  benchmark  in the financial industry due to its risk-free status being backed by the  full faith and credit  of the U.S. government.

Kaizen: Understanding the Japanese Business Philosophy,"Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy that aims to make small changes over time to drive ongoing improvement. 
    What Is Kaizen?    
  The Japanese concept of kaizen encompasses a wide range of ideas. They include making the work environment more efficient by creating a team atmosphere, improving processes and procedures, ensuring  employee engagement , and making jobs more fulfilling, less tiring, and safer. Many companies around the world now practice kaizen in one form or another.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy.  Its goals include greater efficiency, higher quality, and less waste. Kaizen is no longer confined to Japan. The concept of kaizen is now practiced around the world, both in manufacturing and other sectors. 
 
    Understanding Kaizen    
  The goal of kaizen is to make small changes over time to drive continuous improvement within a company. The kaizen process recognizes that small changes now can add up to huge impacts in the future.
 
 
  Ultimately that can mean better  quality control , more efficient processes, and the elimination of waste, among other benefits.
 
 
  Under kaizen, improvements can be initiated by any employee at any time. The philosophy is that everyone has a stake in the company's success and everyone should strive, at all times, to help make the business better.
 
 
  Many companies around the world have adopted the kaizen concept. Most famously, the automaker  Toyota  has long employed kaizen within its organization and describes it as one of its core values. To improve its production system, Toyota encourages and empowers all employees to identify areas of potential improvement and create viable solutions. 1 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Toyota's process of identifying solutions is called ""kaizen blitz."" 
 
 
 
    How Does Kaizen Work? Key Principles    
  Kaizen is often broken down into a set of key principles.
 
 
 
 
  For example, the Kaizen Institute, founded by Masaaki Imai, author of a 1986 book that helped popularize the term, lists them as: 2 
 
 
   Know your customer Let it flow (eliminating waste, or non-value-adding activities, from the workflow) 3 Go to gemba (where things actually happen, such as the factory floor) Empower people Be transparent 
 
 
  Underlying kaizen is the recognition that the people who perform certain tasks and activities know the most about them. Empowering those people to effect change is the best strategy for improvement. Ideally, kaizen will become deeply ingrained in a  company's culture .
 
 
  Kaizen posits that there is no perfect end and that everything can be improved upon, so people must strive to evolve and innovate constantly.
 
 
   Important 
 Teamwork is core to kaizen, where regular team meetings involve discussions about possible improvements. 
 
 
 
    What Are Some Benefits of Kaizen?    
  Kaizen offers companies many potential benefits. They include:
 
 
   Increased productivity Reduced waste Better management of resources Improved quality Better safety Lower costs Greater customer satisfaction Improved cooperation and communication Higher employee satisfaction and morale 4 
 
 
    Kaizen and the PDCA Cycle    
  The improvement process used in kaizen often follows the  PDCA cycle  format, first developed in the U.S. in the 1920s. PDCA stands for Plan-Do-Check-Act.
 
 
  The  Plan  phase includes proposing and mapping out changes so that everyone knows what to expect when teams try to solve a problem.
 
 
  The  Do  stage implements whatever appears to be the best solution for the problem.
 
 
  The  Check  step involves evaluating the solution to the problem to see if it worked.
 
 
  When a company  Acts , it determines whether or not the solution should become a company standard or if it needs further changes. If managers decide to implement more changes, kaizen goes back to the  Plan  step and the process starts over again.
 
 
    Just-in-Time Inventory Strategy    
  One of the key goals of the kaizen process is to reduce waste and increase efficiency in the production cycle. A  just-in-time (JIT)  inventory strategy allows management to minimize excess inventory by matching the delivery of raw materials from suppliers with production schedules.
 
 
  The JIT strategy is part of the Toyota Production System (TPS), which is now used by numerous companies. JIT helps manufacturers save money by reducing  inventory carrying costs . It also reduces waste because companies are not left with extra inventory should a customer cancel or postpone an order. 5 
 
 
  Another Japanese innovation,  kanban  is an inventory control system used in conjunction with a JIT strategy. It provides employees with visual cues that tell them when it is time to order parts and materials as they run out.
 
 
  The system relies on colored cards that track production and alert employees when it's time to replenish a needed part or material. It enables employees to quickly o","By

 The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act sought to protect investors from costly financial scandals by strengthening corporate financial reporting and auditing standards. 
    What Is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002?    
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is a law that the U.S. Congress passed on July 30 of that year to help protect investors from fraudulent financial reporting by corporations. 1 
 
 
  Also known as the SOX Act of 2002, it mandated strict reforms to existing securities regulations and imposed tough new penalties on lawbreakers.
 
 
  The act came in response to financial scandals in the early 2000s involving publicly traded companies such as Enron Corporation, Tyco International plc, and WorldCom. 2 
 
 
  The high-profile frauds that cost billions in losses shook investor confidence in the trustworthiness of corporate financial statements and led many to demand an overhaul of decades-old regulatory standards.
 
 
  The act took its name from its two sponsors—Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio). 3 4

   Key Takeaways 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was a response to highly publicized corporate financial scandals earlier that decade that cost investors billions of dollars. The act created strict new rules for accountants, auditors, and corporate officers and imposed more stringent recordkeeping requirements. The act also added new criminal penalties for violating securities laws. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Matthew Collins 
 
    Understanding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    
  The rules and enforcement policies outlined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 amended or supplemented existing laws dealing with security regulation, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other laws enforced by the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . 5 
 
 
 
 
  The new law set out reforms and additions in four principal areas:
 
 
   Corporate responsibility Increased criminal punishment Accounting regulation New protections 
 
 
   Important 
 Because of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, corporate officers who knowingly certify false financial statements can go to prison. 
 
 
 
    Major Provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a complex and lengthy piece of legislation. Three of its key provisions are Section 302, Section 404, and Section 802. 1 
 
 
   Section 302  mandates that senior corporate officers personally certify in writing that the company's  financial statements  comply with SEC disclosure requirements and ""fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer"" at the time of the financial report.
 
 
  Officers who sign off on financial statements that they know to be inaccurate are subject to criminal penalties, including prison terms.
 
 
   Section 404  requires that management and auditors establish  internal controls  and reporting methods to ensure the adequacy of those controls.
 
 
  Some critics of the law have complained that the requirements in Section 404 can have a negative impact on publicly traded companies because it's often expensive to establish and maintain the necessary internal controls.

 Definition 
 A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports exceed exports during a specific period. 
    What Is a Trade Deficit?    
  A trade deficit occurs when a country's  imports  exceed its  exports . A trade deficit is also referred to as a negative balance of trade ( BOT ). The balance can be calculated on different categories of transactions: goods (a.k.a., “merchandise”), services, goods and services. Balances are also calculated for international transactions—current account, capital account, and financial account.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Balances are calculated for several categories of international transactions Trade deficits can be shorter or longer term. Implications of a trade deficit depend on impacts on production, jobs, national security and how the deficits are financed.

    Understanding Trade Deficits    
  A trade deficit occurs when there is a negative net amount or negative balance in an  international transaction account . The balance of payments (international transaction accounts) records all economic transactions between residents and non-residents where a change in ownership occurs.
 
 
  A trade deficit or net amount can be calculated on different categories within an international transaction account. These include goods, services, goods and services, current account, and the sum of balances on the current and capital accounts. The sum of the balances on the current and capital accounts equals net lending/borrowing.
 
 
  This also equals the balance on the financial account plus a statistical discrepancy. The financial account measures financial assets and liabilities, in contrast to purchases and payments in the current and capital accounts.
 
 
    Advantages of Trade Deficits    
  The most obvious benefit of a trade deficit is that it allows a country to consume more than it produces. In the short run, trade deficits can help nations to avoid shortages of goods and other economic problems.
 
 
 
 
  In some countries, trade deficits correct themselves over time. A trade deficit creates downward pressure on a country's currency under a  floating exchange rate  regime. With a cheaper domestic currency, imports become more expensive in the country with the trade deficit. Consumers react by reducing their consumption of imports and shifting toward domestically produced alternatives. Domestic currency  depreciation  also makes the country's exports less expensive and more competitive in foreign markets.
 
 
  Trade deficits can also occur because a country is a highly desirable destination for foreign investment. For example, the  U.S. dollar's status  as the world's reserve currency creates a strong demand for U.S. dollars. Foreigners must sell goods to Americans to obtain dollars. The stability of developed countries generally attracts capital, while less developed countries must worry about  capital flight .
 
 
    Disadvantages of Trade Deficits    
  Trade deficits can create substantial problems in the long run. The worst and most obvious problem is that trade deficits can facilitate a sort of economic colonization. If a country continually runs trade deficits, citizens of other countries acquire funds to buy up capital in that nation.
 
 
  That can mean making new investments that increase productivity and create jobs. However, it may also involve merely buying up existing businesses, natural resources, and other assets. If this buying continues, foreign investors will eventually own nearly everything in the country.

 Definition 
 Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury bond that is indexed to an inflationary gauge to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money. 
  Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury security issued by the U.S. government. TIPS are indexed to  inflation  to protect  investors  from a decline in the purchasing power of their money. 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury bond that is indexed to an inflationary gauge to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money. The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises, while the interest payment varies with the adjusted principal value of the bond. The principal amount is protected since investors will never receive less than the originally invested principal. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Daniel Fishel / Investopedia 
 
    Understanding Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)    
  The  principal  value of TIPS rises as inflation rises. Inflation is the pace at which prices increase throughout the U.S. economy, as measured by the  Consumer Price Index (CPI) . Inflation becomes an issue when there isn’t a commensurate rise in  real wage  growth to offset the negative effects of rising prices. 1 
 
 
  TIPS are a popular asset for protecting portfolios from inflation and profiting from it because they pay interest every six months based on a fixed rate determined at the bond’s auction. However, the interest payment amounts can vary since the rate is applied to the adjusted principal or value of the bond. If the principal amount is adjusted higher over time due to rising prices, then the  interest rate  will be multiplied by the increased principal amount. As a result, investors receive higher interest or coupon payments as inflation rises. Conversely, investors will receive lower interest payments if  deflation  occurs. 1 
 
 
  TIPS are issued with  maturities  of five, 10, and 30 years and are considered a low-risk investment because the U.S. government backs them. At maturity, TIPS return the adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is greater. 1  
 
 
 
 
  TIPS can be purchased directly from the government through the  TreasuryDirect  system, in $100 increments with a minimum investment of $100, and are available with the aforementioned maturities. 1

  Some investors prefer to get TIPS through a TIPS  mutual fund  or  exchange-traded fund (ETF) . However, purchasing TIPS directly allows investors to avoid the management fees associated with mutual funds.
 
 
    TIPS’ Price Relationship to Inflation    
  TIPS are important since they help combat the  inflation risk  that erodes the yield on fixed-rate bonds. Inflation risk is an issue because the interest rate paid on most bonds is fixed for the life of the bond. As a result, the bond’s interest payments might not keep up with inflation. For example, if prices rise by 3% and an investor’s bond pays 2%, then the investor has a net loss in real terms.

Xenocurrency,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Xenocurrency?    
  The term xenocurrency refers to any currency that is traded in markets outside of its domestic borders. Its name derives from the Greek prefix ""xeno,"" meaning ""foreign.""
 
 
  Today, the use of the term xenocurrency is infrequent as the prefix xeno can have negative connotations in modern English. Xenophobia, for example, means an irrational fear of or hatred toward foreigners. Foreign currency, therefore, has become the preferred term for referring to non-domestic currencies.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A xenocurrency is a currency deposited or exchanged in a market outside its country of origin. Today, the term “eurocurrency” or “foreign currency” is more frequently used. These types of currency transactions have become increasingly common, driven by the globalization of supply chains and financial markets. 
 
    How Xenocurrencies Work    
  The term xenocurrency was developed in 1974 by the Austrian-American economist Fritz Machlup, who served as President of the International Economic Association from 1971 to 1974. 1 2  Machlup used the phrase to refer to deposits and loans denominated in currencies other than that of the bank’s home country.
 
 
  Xenocurrency investments can be risky, since they are complicated by many factors, including currency fluctuations and conversion risks. Risks come when  deposits  are in a rising domestic currency market, where the foreign investment may result in lower returns when converting the funds back into the home currency. However, the opposite is valid for investments in declining domestic currency. Collectively, these risks are known as  foreign currency effects .
 
 
   Political risks  can also be a factor. During a crisis, a country's government might place restrictions on the amount of xenocurrency that travelers may take out of the country. For instance, after the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, 3  the Iranian rial plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar. 4 
 
 
    Real World Example of a Xenocurrency    
  Examples of xenocurrencies include the  Indian rupee (INR)  traded in the United States or the  Japanese yen (JPY)  deposited into a European bank. The  U.S. Dollar (USD)  is likewise often used as xenocurrency in Mexico, especially for large transactions in real estate and other business activities.
 
 
 
 
  Today, the term xenocurrency is frequently used synonymously with  euro currency . Similarly, the phrase xeno-market is often used interchangeably with the term  eurocurrency-market . Eurocurrency-market refers to a money market that trades in xenocurrency. Banks, multinational corporations, mutual funds, and hedge funds use the eurocurrency market. These entities use the market because they wish to circumvent regulatory requirements, tax laws and interest rate caps often present in domestic banking, particularly in the United States.

 Definition 
 The debt ratio is a financial metric that measures a company's leverage by comparing its debt to its assets. 
    What Is the Debt Ratio?    
  The term ""debt ratio"" refers to a financial ratio that identifies a company’s  leverage , or how much borrowing is used as a source of funding.
 
 
  The debt ratio is defined as the ratio of  total debt to total assets , expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt. This is information that's important to sizing up a company's financial health.
 
 
  A ratio greater than 1 means that a considerable amount of a company's assets is funded by debt. In fact, it indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets.
 
 
  A high ratio indicates that a company may be at risk of defaulting on its loans if interest rates suddenly rise. A ratio below 1 means that a greater portion of a company's assets is funded by equity. 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A debt ratio measures the amount of a company's funding that comes from borrowing. This ratio varies widely across industries, such that capital-intensive businesses tend to have much higher debt ratios than others. A company's debt ratio can be calculated by dividing total debt by total assets. A debt ratio of greater than 1.0 (or 100%) means a company has more debt than assets while a debt ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that a company has more assets than debt. Some sources consider the debt ratio to be total liabilities divided by total assets. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Zoe Hansen 
 
    Debt Ratio Formula and Calculation    
  As noted above, a company's debt ratio is a measure of the  extent of its financial leverage . This ratio varies widely across industries. Capital-intensive businesses, such as utilities and pipelines tend to have much higher debt ratios than other companies in, for instance, the  technology sector . 
 The formula for calculating a company's debt ratio is: 
 Debt ratio = Total debt Total assets \begin{aligned} &\text{Debt ratio} = \frac{\text{Total debt}}{\text{Total assets}} \end{aligned} ​ Debt ratio = Total assets Total debt ​ ​ 
 So if a company has total assets of $100 million and total debt of $30 million, its debt ratio is 0.3 or 30%. Is this company in a better financial situation than one with a debt ratio of 40%? The answer depends on the  industry .

 A debt ratio of 30% may be too high for an industry with volatile  cash flows , in which most businesses take on little  debt . A company with a high debt ratio relative to its peers would probably find it expensive to borrow and could find itself in a crunch if circumstances change. 
 Conversely, a debt level of 40% may be easily manageable for a company in a sector such as utilities, where cash flows are stable and higher debt ratios are the norm. 
 A debt ratio greater than 1.0 (100%) tells you that a company has more debt than  assets . A debt ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that a company has more assets than debt. Used in conjunction with other measures of financial health, the debt ratio can help investors determine a company's  risk  level. 1

    What Is Annual Percentage Rate (APR)?    
  Annual percentage rate (APR) is a critical concept for anyone dealing with loans or investments, as it calculates the actual yearly cost of borrowing or earnings from an investment, presented as a percentage. Unlike other interest metrics, APR encompasses not only the nominal interest rate but also includes fees and additional costs. By providing consumers with a single figure, APR simplifies the comparison of different financial products, ensuring informed financial decisions. This article will guide you through understanding how APR works, its implications, and how to use it effectively for smarter financial choices.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 An annual percentage rate (APR) measures the yearly cost of borrowing or income from investing, including fees, without considering compounding interest. Financial institutions must disclose APR thanks to the Truth in Lending Act, allowing consumers to compare rates across financial products effectively. Although APR offers a snapshot of costs, it may understate actual expenditures due to its exclusion of compound interest and possibly unlisted fees. APR differs from annual percentage yield (APY), as the latter accounts for compound interest, making it a more precise reflection of actual financial cost or gain. APRs can vary by credit type, with different rates for purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers, and are influenced by a borrower's credit profile. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Lara Antal 
 
    Understanding How Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Functions    
  An annual percentage rate is expressed as an  interest rate . It calculates what percentage of the principal you’ll pay each year by taking things such as monthly payments and fees into account. APR is also the annual rate of interest paid on investments without accounting for the compounding of interest within that year.
 
 
  The  Truth in Lending Act (TILA)  of 1968 mandates that  lenders disclose  the APR they charge to borrowers. 1  Credit card companies can advertise interest rates monthly, but they must report the APR to customers before agreements are signed.. 2

 Credit card companies can increase your interest rate for new purchases, but not existing balances if they provide you with 45 days' notice first. 3 
 
 
 
    Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Annual Percentage Rate (APR)    
   APR is calculated  by multiplying the  periodic interest rate  by the number of periods in a year in which it was applied. It does not indicate how many times the rate is actually applied to the balance.

 Definition 
 A free trade agreement between two or more countries reduces or eliminates certain costs and obstacles in order to more freely facilitate the exchange of goods and services. 
    What Is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA)?    
  A free trade agreement is an arrangement where two or more countries commit to opening up their markets to one another by lowering or removing tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, making it easier for goods and services to move between them.
 
 
  The concept of free trade is the opposite of trade  protectionism  or economic isolationism.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Free trade agreements reduce or eliminate barriers to trade across international borders. When implemented, these agreements come with regulations and oversight in the U.S. and the E.U. Free trade can be applied based on two models: mercantilism and comparative advantage. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    How a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Works    
  Free trade policy is often implemented by a formal and mutual agreement of the nations involved. A free-trade policy may simply be the absence of any trade restrictions, however.
 
 
  A government doesn't have to take specific action to promote free trade. This hands-off stance is referred to as “ laissez-faire  trade” or trade liberalization.
 
 
  Governments with free-trade policies or agreements in place don't necessarily abandon all control of imports and exports or eliminate all protectionist policies. Few free trade agreements (FTAs) result in completely free trade in modern international trade.

   Important 
 The benefits of free trade were outlined in ""On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,"" published   by economist David Ricardo in 1817. 1 
 
 
 
  For example, a nation might allow free trade with another nation, with exceptions that forbid the import of specific drugs not approved by its regulators, animals that have not been vaccinated, or processed foods that do not meet its standards.
 
 
 
 
  It might also have policies in place that exempt specific products from tariff-free status to protect home producers from foreign competition in their industries.
 
 
    The Economics of Free Trade    
  Free trade on the international level is no different from trade between neighbors, towns, or states. It allows businesses in each country or location to focus on producing and selling the goods that best use their resources. Other businesses import goods that are scarce or unavailable domestically. This mix of local production and foreign trade allows countries to experience faster growth while better meeting the needs of their consumers.
 
 
  This view was first popularized in 1817 by economist David Ricardo in his book, ""On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation."" He argued that free trade expands diversity and lowers the prices of goods available in a nation while better exploiting its homegrown resources, knowledge, and specialized skills. 1 
 
 
    Free Trade Models    
  Free trade can be applied based on two models.
 
 
    Mercantilism    
  Global trade was dominated by the theory of mercantilism before the 1800s. This theory placed priority on having a favorable balance of trade relative to other countries and accumulating more gold and silver.

"Renewable Resource: Definition, Considerations, and Examples","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 A renewable resource is a natural resource that can be replenished over time, making it sustainable for continued use without the risk of permanent depletion. 
    What Is a Renewable Resource?    
  A renewable resource is a resource that can be replenished naturally over time. As a result, it is sustainable despite its consumption by humankind.
 
 
  Renewable resources for the production of energy are considered especially important for their potential to replace nonrenewable, or finite, resources. Additionally, renewable resources can offer cleaner energy solutions than those provided by nonrenewable resources such as coal and fossil fuels.
 
 
  Examples of renewable resources include the sun, wind, water, the Earth’s heat (geothermal), and biomass.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The demand for renewable resources is increasing as the human population continues to grow. Energy created by renewable resources is considered virtually unlimited because of the ability of these resources to regenerate naturally. Renewable energy can lessen the strain on the limited supply of fossil fuels, which are considered nonrenewable resources. Using renewable resources on a large scale is costly, and more research is needed to make them cost-effective. Regardless of the renewable nature of some resources, conservation efforts are important, e.g., where water is concerned. 
 
    Understanding Renewable Resources    
  A renewable resource is a resource of which there is a seemingly endless supply because it can be replenished. For example, renewable resources such as the sun, the wind, and geothermal heat are considered inexhaustible.
 
 
  Water is also considered a renewable natural resource, as long as there is precipitation. Changing climate patterns have underscored the need for conservation efforts to protect water supplies.
 
 
 
 
  Other natural resources are considered renewable even though some time and effort must go into their renewal. In addition, most precious metals are considered renewable because they’re reusable. Since they are not destroyed during their extraction and use, they can be recycled.
 
 
  Unlike renewable resources, once a nonrenewable resource is depleted, it cannot be recovered. As the human population continues to grow and finite resources become increasingly scarce, the demand for renewable resources increases.
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power, bioenergy, and geothermal energy. 
 
 
 
    Renewable Resources Used for Energy    
  Fossil fuels have been used since the late 1880s to produce the energy we use. Renewable resources such as hydropower and wood have been used much longer. In fact, they were the two primary renewable energy resources up to the 1990s.
 
 
  In the years since, renewable energy production has come increasingly from biomass, geothermal, solar, water, and wind resources.
 
 
  Renewable resources that can replace fossil fuels in the production of energy are a major focus of nations around the world. The challenges for successful renewable energy production include reliability and expense.
 
 
  A great deal of research is taking place to determine the viability and best implementation of renewable energy on a mass scale. 
 
 
   Important 
 The  Paris Climate Accord  is an agreement involving over 180 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the global temperature increase to less than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels by the year 2100. On Jan. 20, 2021, then-President Joe Biden signed an executive order for the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump’s first presidential administration withdrew from it on Nov. 4, 2020. 1  Trump returned to office in January 2025 and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement again. 2 
 
 
 
    Examples of Renewable Resources    
    Sun    
  Sunlight is a widely recognized renewable resource. In fact, it has been used throughout human history to warm shelters, dry and cook foods, and heat water. Different technologies exist and continue to be developed to collect and convert solar radiation into heat energy that can be used for various purposes.
 
 
  For example, solar photovoltaic (PV) devices, or solar cells, change sunlight into electricity. Depending on the number of solar cells in use, they can power small appliances or provide electricity for many homes.
 
 
  The challenge with using sunlight for our energy needs is that it can vary and, at times, be unreliable. The availability of sunlight depends on the time of day, existing weather conditions, season of the year, and geographic location. 3 
 
 
    Wind    
  Wind has a direct relationship to the sun. Daily winds result when the sun’s heat is captured unevenly by the varying surfaces on the Earth, including oceans and other water masses. Air above land heats up faster than air above water during the day when t","By

"Zero-Coupon Bond: Definition, How It Works, and How to Calculate","Definition 
 Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount and they repay the par value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value is the investor's return. 
    What Is a Zero-Coupon Bond?    
  A zero-coupon bond is an investment in debt that doesn't pay interest. It instead trades at a deep discount. The profit is realized at its maturity date when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.
 
 
  A zero-coupon bond is also known as an accrual bond.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A zero-coupon bond doesn't pay interest to the holder. Zero-coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount to face value but they're repaid at full face value or par at maturity. The difference between the purchase price of a zero-coupon bond and its par value is the investor's return. They can be subject to interest rate risk if investors sell them before maturity.

    The Basics of Zero-Coupon Bonds    
  Some bonds are issued as zero-coupon instruments. Others are transformed into zero-coupon instruments after a financial institution strips them of their coupons and repackages them as zero-coupon bonds.
 
 
  They offer payment at face value at maturity so zero-coupon bonds tend to fluctuate in price on the secondary market much more than  coupon bonds . 1 
 
 
    What Is a Bond?    
  A bond is a tool for a company or a government to borrow money. Investors who purchase bonds are effectively acting as lenders to the issuing entity. The investors earn a return in the form of  coupon payments  that are made semiannually or annually throughout the life of the bond.

  The bondholder is repaid an amount equal to the  face value  of the bond when the  bond matures . The par or face value of a corporate bond is typically stated as $1,000.
 
 
  Investors can purchase the bond below its par value if a corporate bond is issued at a discount. An investor who purchases a bond for $920 at a discount will receive $1,000 when it reaches its maturity date. The $80 return plus coupon payments are the investor's earnings for holding the bond.
 
 
  Not all bonds have coupon payments, however. Those that do not are referred to as zero-coupon bonds.
 
 
    How Zero-Coupon Bonds Work    
  Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount, and they repay the par value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value represents the investor's return. The payment received by the investor is equal to the principal invested plus the interest earned, compounded semiannually at a stated yield.
 
 
  The interest earned on a zero-coupon bond is an  imputed interest . It's an estimated interest rate for the bond and not an established interest rate. A bond with a face value of $20,000 that matures in 20 years with a 5.5% yield may be purchased for roughly $6,855. The investor will receive $20,000 at the end of the 20 years.
 
 
  The difference between $20,000 and $6,855 is $13,145. This represents the  interest that compounds  automatically until the bond matures. Imputed interest is sometimes referred to as ""phantom interest.""
 
 
  The imputed interest on the bond is subject to federal  income tax . 2 3  No coupon payments are made on zero-coupon bonds until maturity but investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on the imputed interest that accrues each year.
 
 
  Purchasing a municipal zero-coupon bond, buying zero-coupon bonds in a tax-exempt account, or purchasing a corporate zero-coupon bond that has tax-exempt status are a few ways to avoid paying income taxes on these securities. 1 
 
 
    Pricing a Zero-Coupon Bond    
  The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated like this:
 
 
  Price = M ÷ (1 + r) n 
 
 
  where:
 
 
   M = Maturity value or face value of the bond r = required rate of interest n = number of years until maturity 
 
 
  An investor would be willing to pay the following if they wanted to make a 6% return on a bond with a $25,000 par value that's due to mature in three years:
 
 
  $25,000 / (1 + 0.06) 3  = $20,991.
 
 
  The bond would be sold to the investor at $20,991 / $25,000 = 84% of the face value if the debtor accepted this offer. The investor gains $25,000 - $20,991 = $4,009 at maturity. This translates to 6% interest per year.
 
 
   Important 
 The greater the length of time until the bond matures, the less the investor pays for it, and vice versa. 
 
 
 
  The maturity dates on zero-coupon bonds are usually long-term with initial maturities of at least 10 years. These long-term maturity dates let investors plan for long-range goals such as saving for a chil",N/A,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"

 Definition 
 In technical analysis, resistance is a price point or zone where selling interest tends to emerge, preventing an asset's price from rising further. 
    What Is Resistance ?    
  Resistance is one of the foundational elements of technical analysis (along with its corollary:  support ). Resistance is a price or price zone above the current market that contains the upside movement of an asset. Resistance is where selling interest appears over time, blocking further upside progress.
 
 
  Resistance can be a single price point, such as the high of the day or the hourly high. Resistance can also be a zone, meaning an area several points wide, such as $0.50/$1.00. A resistance zone represents a test of the resistance level, which may be broken by a small amount, but ultimately turns back the price advance, leaving the resistance level essentially intact. It could also be interpreted to mean that there is even more supply around the resistance zone, potentially signaling a reversal lower.
 
 
  Resistance can be found in any time frame of chart analysis, where a longer time frame (daily or weekly) suggests a more important, multiday resistance level, while a short-term chart (hourly or 30 minutes) may reveal only minor resistance (good for day traders).
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A resistance level represents a price point or price zone that an asset has had trouble breaking above in the time period being considered. A resistance level may be several points wide, due to multiple attempts to break above the resistance, potentially forming a resistance zone and sending prices lower. Trendline analysis is a simple but powerful way to identify areas of resistance, while other mathematical methods are frequently used as well. Resistance levels are important to identify for multiple reasons: where to place a stop for a short position; where to place a take-profit order for a long position; and when to enter a long position on a break of resistance (a breakout trade). 
 
    How Do Supply and Demand Affect Resistance?    
   Demand  for an asset is what propels it higher over time, absorbing market supply along the way. Liquidity refers to the amount of total supply and demand at any given time. High liquidity is likely to limit the overall share price movement, while low liquidity may see prices move excessively, potentially making a  gap .
 
 
 
 
  The source of the demand may be a piece of macroeconomic news, such as a comment from a Federal Reserve official or an earnings release. After a series of gains, however, the demand may eventually lessen or stop altogether, as in “the buying spree has ended.” If the price forms a  top , then it now functions as a point or zone of resistance.
 
 
   Supply  can come from multiple sources, such as take-profit selling around a resistance point or zone. Another example is where option holders may want to defend their option positions by selling a lot of shares at a specific price point ahead of resistance. And of course, macro news may pull traders in to short the market for a specific stock or other asset if negative news emerges, leaving a resistance point behind in its wake.
 
 
    Resistance Is Made to Be Broken    
  Using technical analysis, traders can identify a particular point or zone of resistance. That resistance zone is likely to be tested amid an uptrend. If the trend and buying interest are sufficient to challenge a resistance point, traders may find that the resistance area breaks, bringing in yet more breakout buyers.  Stop-loss  buy orders above the resistance area may also come in to play, bringing in","0 seconds of 1 minute, 48 seconds",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp,Learn about our,investopedia.com,"finance, investment, financial education"
Weighted Average: Definition and How It Is Calculated and Used,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Weighted Average?    
  A weighted average is a calculation that assigns varying degrees of importance to the numbers in a particular data set. A weighted average can be more accurate than a simple average in which all numbers in a data set are assigned an identical weight. It is widely used in investing and many other fields.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 The weighted average accounts for the relative importance or frequency of some factors in a data set. In a weighted average, each data point value is multiplied by the assigned weight, which is then summed and divided by the total number of data points. Stock investors use a weighted average to establish the cost basis of shares they bought at different times and different prices. A weighted average is sometimes more accurate than a simple average, although it is also introduces subjectivity into the equation. 
 
 
 Weighted Average 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin 
 
    What Is the Purpose of a Weighted Average?    
  In calculating a simple average, or  arithmetic mean , all numbers are treated equally and assigned equal weight. But a weighted average assigns weights that determine in advance the relative importance of each data point. In calculating a weighted average, each number in the data set is multiplied by a predetermined weight before the final calculation is made.
 
 
  A weighted average is most often computed to equalize the frequency of the values in a data set. For example, a voter survey might gather enough responses to be considered statistically valid, but the 18-to-34 age group may have fewer respondents than other groups relative to their share of the  population . The survey team could weight the results of the 18-to-34 age group so that their views are represented proportionately.
 
 
 
 
  However, values in a data set may be  weighted  for other reasons than the frequency of occurrence. For example, if students in a dance class are graded on skill, attendance, and manners, the grade for skill may be given greater weight than the other factors.

  Each data point value in a weighted average is multiplied by the assigned weight, which is then summed and divided by the number of data points. The final average number reflects the relative importance of each observation and is thus more descriptive than a simple average. It also has the effect of smoothing out the data and enhancing its accuracy.

    Weighting a Stock Portfolio    
   Investors  often build a position in a particular stock over a number of years and at a variety of different prices. That makes it tough to keep track of the  cost basis  of those shares for tax and other purposes.
 
 
  The investor can calculate a weighted average by multiplying the number of shares acquired at each price by that price, adding those values, then dividing the total value by the total number of shares.
 
 
  For example, say an investor acquires 100 shares of a company in year one at $10 per share, and 50 shares of the same stock in year two at $40 per share. To get a weighted average of the price paid, the investor multiplies 100 shares by $10 for year one and 50 shares by $40 for year two, then adds the results to get a total of $3,000. Next, the total amount paid for the shares, $3,000 in this case, is divided by the number of shares acquired over both years, 150, to get the weighted average price paid of $20.
 
 
    Advantages and Disadvantages of Weighted Average    
    Pros of Weighted Average    
  Weighted average can provide a more accurate representation of data when different values within a dataset hold varying degrees of importance. By assigning weights to each value based on their significance, weighted averages ensure that more weight is given to data points that have a greater impact on the overall result. This allows for a more nuanced analysis and decision-making process.
 
 
  Next, weighted averages are particularly useful for handling skewed distributions or outliers within a dataset. Instead of being overly influenced by extreme values, weighted averages take into account the relative importance of each data point. This means you can ""manipulate"" your data set so it's more relevant, especially when you don't want to consider extreme values.

What Is a Credit Limit? How It's Determined and How to Increase It,"Definition 
 A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit that a financial institution allows a borrower to access on a line of credit, such as a credit card. 
    What Is a Credit Limit?    
  A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit a financial institution extends to a client on a credit card or a  line of credit . Lenders usually set credit limits based on specific information about the credit-seeking applicant, including their income and employment status. Credit limits are an important factor that can affect consumers'  credit scores  and their ability to obtain credit in the future.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit you receive from a financial institution. Products like credit cards and lines of credit have credit limits. Lenders usually set credit limits based on the information in a consumer's credit report, among other factors. High-risk borrowers generally have lower credit limits, while lower-risk borrowers typically receive higher credit limits. It is usually not ideal to use your maximum credit limit. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Julie Bang 
 
    How a Credit Limit Works    
  A credit limit is the maximum amount of money a lender will allow you to spend using a particular credit card or  revolving  line of credit. Lenders set those limits based on several factors, including your credit score, personal income, and loan repayment history. Lenders generally offer higher limits to borrowers they view as lower risks. 1 
 
 
  Credit limits can apply to both  secured  and  unsecured  credit. If the line of credit is secured, or backed by collateral, the lender takes the value of the collateral into account and may offer a higher limit. For example, if you take out a  home equity  line of credit (HELOC), your credit limit will be based, in part, on the equity in your home. 2 
 
 
  Lenders will generally issue higher credit limits to creditors they consider to be lower risk and put  lower credit limits on riskier borrowers .
 
 
 
 
  A credit limit works the same way regardless of whether you have a credit card or a line of credit. You can spend up to the credit limit. If you exceed the credit limit, you may face fines or penalties on top of your regular payment. If the you spend less than the limit, you can continue to use the card or line of credit until you reach the limit.
 
 
   Important 
 A downside to high credit limits is that they can potentially lead to overspending, to the point where you cannot afford your monthly payments. 
 
 
 
    Credit Limit vs. Available Credit    
  A credit limit and  available credit  are not the same. The credit limit is the total amount you can borrow, whereas available credit is the amount that is remaining for you to use, including if you carry a balance.
 
 
  For example, if you have a credit card with a $1,000 credit limit, and you charge $600, you have an additional $400 to spend. If you make a $40 payment, your balance would fall to $560, and you would then have $440 in available credit.
 
 
    How Credit Limits Affect Your Credit Score    
  Your credit limits can have an impact on your credit score, an important number that lenders use to decide whether to issue you new credit and what interest rate to charge you for it. That's because your  credit utilization ratio , or the amount of debt you have outstanding at any given time as a percentage of the total credit you have access to, is one of the factors that goes into computing your score.
 
 
  The lower that percentage, the better. So it pays to be aware of your credit limits and try to keep your borrowing well beneath them. Generally speaking, lenders look unfavorably on a credit utilization ratio that exceeds 30%. 3 
 
 
    Can Lenders Change Your Credit Limit?    
  In most cases, lenders reserve the right to change credit limits, either raising or lowering them. If you pay your bills on time every month and do not max out a credit card or line of credit, the lender may increase your credit limit. 4 
 
 
  An increased credit limit has  a number of benefits , including potentially increasing your credit score by lowering your credit utilization ratio. It also gives you access to more credit if you should need it, such as in an unexpected emergency.
 
 
  On the other hand, if you fail to make regular, timely payments, or if there are other signs of risk, the lender may opt to reduce your credit limit. A reduction of your credit limit will raise your credit utilization ratio and potentially damage your credit score. If a lender decides to lower your credit limit, it is generally required to notify you. 4 
 
 
   What is Available Credit? 
 Available credit  is the unused portion of a credit limit. So, if you have a total credit limit of $10,000 on your credit card and you have used $5,000, you would have the remaining $5,000 as available credit. Available credit can fluctuate throughout the billing cycle based on account usage.

Value Proposition: How to Write It With Examples,"What Is a Value Proposition?    
  A value proposition in marketing is a concise statement of the benefits that a company is delivering to customers who buy its products or services. It serves as a declaration of intent, both inside the company and in the marketplace.
 
 
  The term value proposition is believed to have first appeared in a McKinsey & Co. industry research paper in 1988, which defined it as ""a clear, simple statement of the benefits, both tangible and intangible, that the company will provide, along with the approximate price it will charge each customer segment for those benefits."" 1 
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 A company's value proposition tells a customer the number one reason why a product or service is best suited for that particular customer. A value proposition should be communicated to customers directly, either via the company's website or other marketing or advertising materials. Value propositions can follow different formats, as long as they are ""on brand,"" unique, and specific to the company in question. A successful value proposition should be persuasive and help turn a prospect into a paying customer. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / NoNo Flores 
 
    Understanding Value Propositions    
  A value proposition stands as a promise by a company to a customer or  market segment . The proposition is an easy-to-understand reason why a customer should buy a product or service from that particular business. A value proposition should clearly explain how a product fills a need, communicate the specifics of its added benefit, and state the reason why it's better than similar products on the market. The ideal value proposition is to-the-point and appeals to a customer's strongest decision-making drivers.
 
 
  Companies use this statement to target customers who will benefit most from using the company's products, and this helps maintain a company's  economic moat . An economic moat is a competitive advantage. The moat analogy—coined by super-investor  Warren Buffett  of Berkshire Hathaway—states that the wider the moat, the bigger and more resilient the firm is to competition. 2 
 
 
 
 
   Important 
 A great value proposition demonstrates what a brand has to offer a customer that no other competitor has and how a service or product fulfills a need that no other company is able to fill. 
 
 
 
    Components of a Value Proposition    
  A company's value proposition communicates the number one reason why a product or service is best suited for a customer segment. Therefore, it should always be displayed prominently on a company's website and in other consumer touch points. It also must be intuitive, so that a customer can read or hear the  value proposition  and understand the delivered value without needing further explanation.
 
 
  Value propositions that stand out tend to make use of a particular structure. A successful value proposition typically has a strong, clear headline that communicates the delivered benefit to the consumer. The headline should be a single memorable sentence, phrase, or even a tagline. It frequently incorporates catchy slogans that become part of  successful advertising campaigns . 3 
 
 
  Often a subheadline will be provided underneath the main headline, expanding on the explanation of the delivered value and giving a specific example of why the product or service is superior to others the consumer has in mind. The subheading can be a short paragraph and is typically between two and three sentences long. The subheading is a way to highlight the key features or benefits of the products and often benefits from the inclusion of bullet points or another means of highlighting standout details.
 
 
  This kind of structure allows consumers to scan the value proposition quickly and pick up on product features. Added visuals increase the ease of communication between business and consumer. In order to craft a strong value proposition, companies will often conduct  market research  to determine which messages resonate the best with their customers.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
  Value propositions can follow different formats as long as they are unique to the company and to the consumers the company services. All  effective value propositions  are easy to understand and demonstrate specific results for a customer using a product or service. They differentiate a product or service from any competition, avoid overused marketing  buzzwords , and communicate value within a short amount of time.
 
 
  For a value proposition to effectively turn a prospect into a paying customer, it should clearly identify who the customers are, what their main problems are, and how the company's product or service is the ideal solution to help them solve their problem. 3

"Social Media: Definition, Importance, Top Websites, and Apps","Close 
 
 
 
 Definition 
 Social media is a form of digital communication that allows users to form online networks and communities for socializing, sharing information, and posting user-created content. 
    What Is Social Media?    
  Social media refers to online platforms where users can share information and connect with virtual communities through text, video, photos, and other content. As of 2024, social media had more than five billion global users, which is equal to more than 62% of the world population. 1  This includes apps or websites designed for messaging and chat, social platforms (like  Facebook , Instagram, and TikTok), and community forums, such as Reddit and Discord.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Social media is made up of websites, apps, and other platforms that allow users to share information and ideas with virtual communities through text, photos, videos, and more. It is used by more than 5 billion people globally for personal and professional reasons. 1 Social media has been credited with connecting users, allowing for community building and sharing important information. Critics say social media damages adolescents' mental health, facilitates misinformation, and increases opportunities for child sexual abuse. The largest social media platforms are Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and TikTok. 
 
    Origins and Evolution of Social Media    
  Early social media platforms, such as MySpace and LiveJournal, were designed for people to connect with friends and family. MySpace, which allowed users to create personal profile pages and share information about themselves, became the first network to reach one million  active monthly users  in 2004. 2  LiveJournal, a platform where users could share journal-like entries with either public or private networks, reached over 2.5 million active accounts in 2005. 3 
 
 
  Social media use grew rapidly in the 2000s and early 2010s as Facebook and  X (formerly Twitter)  became popular. Like MySpace, Facebook users create profiles to share information about themselves, while other users leave comments. Initially used for socializing among college-age users, social media became popular with younger and older users.
 
 
  In 2006, X's launch included its feed feature, where posts from accounts that a user followed were aggregated onto a single page. 4  Facebook launched its own News Feed feature. 5  The news feed became a standard feature for many social media platforms. More users began posting links to external sites, where news stories, current events, and product pages could be shared with personal updates. Users could interact with each other's content, including liking, sharing, and commenting on posts.
 
 
 
 
  During this time, social media platforms began adding business-specific profile pages and the ability to purchase targeted ads that other users would see, making them more business-friendly and increasing revenue for the platforms. 6

  Social media users began spending more time scrolling through feeds and consuming daily news and commentary on current events. By 2024, just over half (54%) of adults in the U.S. said they get their news from social media ""sometimes"" or ""often."" Only 28% of U.S. adults say they ""never"" get the news from social media. 7  Globally, only 22% of consumers get their news directly from news websites or apps, with younger news consumers the least likely to do so. 8 
 
 
   Fast Fact 
 Many  social media companies  own multiple platforms to target different users. For example, Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. 9 
 
 
 
    How Social Media Is Used Today    
  As users continued to spend more time on social media sites, different types of social media platforms evolved. They can be broadly categorized as:
 
 
   Social networks : Facebook, NextDoor Microblogging : X, BlueSky, Mastodon, Threads Long-form blogging : Substack, Ghost Professional networking : LinkedIn, Behance, ResearchGate Video and photo sharing : Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat Visual curation and search : Pinterest, Houzz, DeviantArt Messaging : WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat, Marco Polo Community forums : Reddit, Discord, Clubhouse 
 
 
  Platforms are oriented toward different uses and users. Some may be used purely for socializing, while others are oriented toward professional network building or job-hunting. Some platforms allow users to connect with others who share their political views or leisure hobbies.

"30-Year Treasury: Meaning, History, Examples","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is the 30-Year Treasury?    
  The 30-Year Treasury is a U.S. Treasury debt obligation that has a maturity of 30 years. The 30-year Treasury used to be the  bellwether  U.S. bond but now most consider the 10-year Treasury to be the benchmark.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 30-year Treasuries are bonds issued by the U.S. government and have a maturity of 30 years. Other securities issued by the U.S. government include Treasury bills, notes, and Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). 30-year Treasuries pay interest semiannually until they mature and at maturity pay the face value of the bond. 
 
    Understanding the 30-Year Treasury    
  The U.S. government borrows money from investors by issuing debt securities through its Treasury department. Debt instruments that can be purchased from the government include  Treasury bills  (T-bills), notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). T-bills are  marketable securities  issued for terms of less than a year, and  Treasury notes  are issued with maturities from two to 10 years.
 
 
   TIPS  are marketable securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). When there is inflation, the principal increases. When deflation sets in, the principal decreases. 1  U.S. Treasury securities with longer-term maturities can be purchased as U.S. Savings bonds or Treasury bonds.
 
 
    Special Considerations    
   Treasury bonds  are long-term debt securities issued with a maturity of 20 years or 30 years from the issue date. These marketable securities pay interest semi-annually, or every six months until they mature. At maturity, the investor is paid the  face value  of the bond. The 30-year Treasury will generally pay a higher interest rate than shorter Treasuries to compensate for the additional risks inherent in the longer maturity. However, when compared to other bonds, Treasuries are relatively safe because they are backed by the U.S. government. 2 
 
 
  The price and interest rate of the 30-year Treasury bond is determined at an  auction  where it is set at either par, premium, or  discount to par . If the  yield to maturity  (YTM) is greater than the interest rate, the price of the bond will be issued at a discount. If the YTM is equal to the interest rate, the price will be equal to par. Finally, if the YTM is less than the interest rate, the Treasury bond price will be sold  at a premium  to par. In a single auction, a bidder can buy up to $5 million in bonds by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding. In addition, the bonds are sold in increments of $100 and the minimum purchase is $100. 3 
 
 
 
 
    30-Year Treasury vs. Savings Bonds    
   U.S. Savings bonds , specifically,  Series EE Savings bonds , are non-marketable securities that earn interest for 30 years. Interest isn’t paid out periodically. Instead, interest accumulates, and the investor receives everything when they redeem the savings bond. The bond can be redeemed after one year, but if they are sold before five years from the purchase date, the investor will lose the last three months' interest. 4  For example, an investor who sells the Savings bond after 24 months will only receive interest for 21 months.
 
 
  Because the U.S. is seen as a very low-risk borrower, many investors see 30-year Treasury interest rates as indicative of the state of the wider bond market. Normally, the interest rate decreases with greater demand for 30-year Treasury securities and rises with lower demand. The S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Current 30-Year Index is a one-security index comprising the most recently issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. It is a market value-weighted index that seeks to measure the performance of the Treasury bond market. 5

"Swing Low: Definition, Example, Trading Strategies","Close 
 
 
 
    What Is a Swing Low?    
  Swing low is a term used in technical analysis that refers to the  troughs  reached by a security’s price or an indicator during a given period of time, usually fewer than 20 trading periods. A swing low is created when a low is lower than any other surrounding prices in a given period of time. A swing low’s opposite counterpart is a  swing high . Swing lows and swing highs are used a number of different ways to identify trading strategies, trend directions and volatility ranges.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Marking the trough in fluctuation prices, swing lows are a visually obvious low point in a given collection of trading periods. The relative low point in the last 20 or so trading periods will likely be identified as the swing low. Swing lows are subjective to the time frame of the observer. 
 
    Understanding a Swing Low    
  A swing low represents a relative low point in price action within a given time frame. On a daily chart, a swing low would likely be the lowest price in the most recent month. A swing low is often associated with  swing trading  strategies.
 
 
  Swing traders work on a variety of different time frames, and the swing low price would be the lowest price in the given time frame these traders watch. For some it might be the lowest price in a week, or for others trading on hourly charts, it might be the lowest price in the last few hours. For still others it might be the lowest price in the last hour or less. Because prices fluctuate on all time frames, a swing low is a subjective observation based on the time frame most important to the observer. A typical swing low, regardless of time frame should be rather obvious to even a casual observer as shown in the following example.

  In this example, swing highs are marked by the points numbered 1 and 2. The swing low in this illustration is the point marked by the letter B. Letter A is shown for comparison purposes. If a trader were interested in every high and low point in a three-to-four-day period, both of these points would be considered a swing low. For most chart viewers, only point B would be considered the swing low of interest here.
 
 
  Swing lows can be defined as part of an algorithm, in which case they become more useful. Swing lows and swing highs can be used to determine trends. A series of swing lows and swing highs that are all rising indicates an upward (bullish) trend is continuing. If one of the lows or highs breaks the pattern and posts lower, this becomes a signal that traders or technical analysts will pay attention to and watch for possible trend change. Successively lower swing lows indicate that the underlying security is in a downtrend, while higher lows signal a potential change to an uptrend.
 
 
 
 
  Swing lows are useful for an investor who holds a long position in a security because they can be used to determine strategic locations for a stop-loss order. According to the  Dow Theory , if price breaks below a previous low, this movement can be interpreted as the beginning of a downtrend. In the case of an indicator, if it fails to make a new swing low while the price of the security continues to decline, a positive  divergence  occurs, which could indicate that the downtrend is losing momentum. Consecutive swing lows may also form a trend reversal pattern, such as a double or triple bottom.
 
 
    Swing Low Trading Strategies    
   Trend Retracement : Traders can use a swing low to enter a position at a more favorable price in a stock that is trending. To help determine if a swing low is nearing completion, traders can use technical indicators, such as the  stochastic oscillator , a moving average or trendline. Ideally, a swing low finds support from multiple indicators.
 
 
  Traders should wait for momentum to return to the upside before opening a trade. For example, momentum might be confirmed by the stochastic oscillator crossing back above 20, or simply, by two consecutive up days. A  stop-loss order  should be placed below the swing low to close the trade if price unexpectedly reverses. If the stock continues to rise, the stop can be trailed higher under each successive swing low.
 
 
   Trend Reversal : Multiple swings lows after a prolonged  downtrend  could indicate a market bottom is in place. For this setup to be valid, the low point of each swing low should be roughly equal. Often the most recent swing low on the chart is slightly below the previous swing low as the  smart money  clears out stop-loss orders before moving the market higher.
 
 
  A trend  reversal  is confirmed when price closes above the previous swing low’s reactionary high. Traders can set an initial profit target by subtracting the lowest point of the consecutive swing lows from the confirmation point. For instance, if the lowest point is $50 and the confirmation point is $75, the difference of $25 ($75 - $50) is us","By

 A 10-year U.S. Treasury note is a debt security issued by the U.S. and is a loan made by the investor to the government with a maturity of 10 years from the date it's issued. 
    What Is a 10-Year Treasury Note?    
  The 10-year Treasury note is a debt obligation issued by the U.S. government with a maturity of 10 years upon initial issuance. A 10-year Treasury note pays interest at a fixed rate every six months and pays the face value to the holder at maturity. The U.S. government partially funds itself by issuing these notes.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Treasury notes (T-notes) have maturities of up to 10 years. These can be appropriate for long-term saving or investing. You don't necessarily have to hold 10-year T-notes for the entire duration. You can sell them at any time in the secondary market. The 10-year T-note is the most widely tracked government debt instrument in finance. T-note prices typically move in the opposite direction from major stock market indexes. 
 
    How 10-Year Treasury Notes Work    
  The U.S. government issues three types of debt securities to fund its obligations:  Treasury bills , Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. Bills, bonds, and notes are distinguished by their length of maturity.
 
 
  Treasury bills (T-bills) have the shortest lengths of time to maturity—one year or less. The Treasury offers T-bills with maturities of four, eight, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. Treasury notes have maturities ranging from one to 10 years. Bonds are Treasury securities with maturities longer than 10 years. 1 2 3 
 
 
  Treasury notes and bonds pay interest at a fixed rate every six months to maturity. They're then redeemed at  par value . The Treasury repays the principal it borrowed.
 
 
  T-bills are issued at discounts to par, and they don't have coupon payments. The interest on T-bills is the difference between the face value repaid at maturity and the purchase price. 1

    The 10-Year Note Yield As a Benchmark    
  The 10-year T-note is the most widely tracked government debt instrument. Its  yield  is frequently used as a benchmark for other interest rates, like mortgage and corporate debt. Commercial interest rates don't follow the 10-year yield, however.
 
 
  The chart below shows the historical 10-year Treasury yield from March 2022 to April 2025. Since March 2022, the 10-year Treasury yield has seen a general upward trajectory, blotted with fluctuations. The upward trajectory is a result of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates to curb the high  inflation  experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 
  The interest rate set by the Fed increased from a range of 0.25% and 0.50% in March 2022 to a range of 5.25% and 5.50% in July 2023, with rates only starting to slightly come down in September 2024. 4 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  The yield of the 10-year note went from about 1.7% in March 2022 to a peak of 4.98% in October 2023. As of April 2025, the rate is about 4.4%. 5 
 
 
  The 10-year note is undoubtedly a highly significant benchmark for global financial markets. A rising yield indicates investor confidence in the economy but also suggests higher borrowing costs, potentially slowing economic growth.

Yield on Cost (YOC): Overview and Examples,"Close 
 
 
 
    What Is Yield on Cost (YOC)?    
  Yield on cost (YOC) is a measure of  dividend yield  calculated by dividing a stock's current dividend by the price initially paid for that stock. For example, if an investor purchased a stock five years ago for $20, and its current dividend is $1.50 per share, then the YOC for that stock would be 7.5%.
 
 
  YOC should not be confused with the term "" current dividend yield ."" The latter refers to the dividend payment divided by the stock's current price, rather than the price at which it was initially purchased.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 YOC is a measure of dividend yield based on the original price paid for the investment. YOC can grow significantly over time if the company regularly increases its dividend, so investing for dividend growth is the way for long-term investors to maximize YOC. Investors using YOC should ensure they do not compare it to other stocks' current dividend yields, as this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. 
 
    Understanding Yield on Cost (YOC)    
  YOC shows the dividend yield associated with the initial price paid for an investment. For that reason, stocks that have grown their dividends over time can deliver very high YOCs, especially if the investor has held on to the stock for many years. In fact, it is not unusual for  long-term investors  to own stocks whose current dividend payments are higher than the original price paid for the security, producing a YOC of 100% or greater.
 
 
  YOC is calculated based on the initial price paid for a security. Therefore, investors must make sure they keep track of the holding costs they have incurred for that security over time, as well as any additional share purchases they have made. All of these costs should be included in the cost component of the YOC calculation. Otherwise, the yield will appear unrealistically high.
 
 
  When evaluating dividend yields, investors must also be careful not to compare apples and oranges. Specifically, just because a stock's YOC is higher than the current dividend yield of another company, it does not mean that the stock with the higher YOC is necessarily the better investment. That is because the company with the high YOC may actually have a lower current dividend yield than other companies.
 
 
 
 
  In these situations, the investor could be better off selling their shares in the high YOC company and investing the proceeds in a company with a higher current dividend yield.
 
 
   Important 
 Considering (YOC) shows investors the long-term benefits of stocks compared to bonds. Since bonds pay fixed interest rates rather than dividends that grow, they have much less long-term potential. 
 
 
 
    Example of Yield on Cost (YOC)    
  Emma is a retiree who is reviewing her pension's investment returns. Her portfolio includes a large position in XYZ Corporation, which her  portfolio manager  purchased 15 years ago for $10/share. When it was purchased, XYZ had a current dividend yield of 5% based on a dividend of $0.50 per share.
 
 
  In each of the 15 years that followed, XYZ raised its dividend by $0.20 per year. It is expected to pay $3.50 per share this year. Its stock price has risen to $50 per share, resulting in a YOC of 35% ($3.50 divided by the initial $10/share purchase price) and a current dividend yield of 7% ($3.50 divided by the current $50 share price).
 
 
  Emma considers XYZ to have been one of her most successful investments. She takes satisfaction out of seeing the lofty YOC that it produces every year. Looking over the most recent report from her portfolio manager, she was therefore shocked to find that they had sold the XYZ position. The manager reinvested the proceeds in ABC Industries, a company with similar financial strength as XYZ, but with a current yield of 8.50%. Dismayed by this seemingly foolish decision, Emma calls her portfolio manager. She asks why they sold a position yielding 35% in exchange for one yielding only 8.50%.
 
 
  The portfolio manager explains to Emma that she has made a common mistake. Rather than comparing YOC to the current dividend yield, she should make an apples-to-apples comparison between both companies' current dividend yields. From this perspective, switching to ABC was perhaps a wise choice because it offered a higher yield on her money—8.50% versus 7%. However, the two companies'  dividend growth  prospects are more important if Emma wants to continue increasing the yield on cost.

 Definition 
 Beta is a widely used indicator of the price volatility, or the level of risk, of a stock relative to the broader market. 
    What Is Beta?    
  Beta is an indicator of the price volatility of a stock or other asset in comparison with the broader market. It suggests the level of risk that an investor takes on in buying the stock. The higher the beta number, the higher the risk.
 
 
  The market that the stock trades in, such as the S&P 500, always has a beta of 1.0. A number above one indicates that the stock's price swings more, up or down, than the market in general. A number below one indicates its price is more stable.
 
 
  The current beta of any stock can usually be found on the summary page of its listing on any financial website or stock trading site.
 
 
   Key Takeaways 
 Beta gets its name from the second letter of the Greek alphabet, the letter (β). Conventional wisdom says that stocks with a higher degree of risk have a higher chance of outperforming the markets. Investors who aim for a balanced portfolio might include both stocks that have a high beta and stocks that have a low beta. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   Investopedia / Yurle Villegas 
 
    How Beta Works    
  A  beta  coefficient shows the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. Beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each point represents an individual stock's returns against the market.
 
 
  Beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market. It is used in the  capital asset pricing model  (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. CAPM is used to price risky securities and to estimate the expected returns of assets, considering the risk of those assets and the cost of capital.

    Calculating Beta    
  A security's beta is calculated by dividing the product of the  covariance  of the security's returns and the market's returns by the  variance  of the market's returns over a specified period. The  calculation  helps investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. It also provides insights into how volatile—or how risky—a stock is relative to the rest of the market. 
 For beta to provide useful insight, the market used as a  benchmark should be related  to the stock. For example, a bond ETF's beta with the S&P 500 as the benchmark would not be helpful to an investor because bonds and stocks are too dissimilar.

IMF External Sector Reports,"The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. Sign up to receive free e-mail notices when new series and/or country items are posted on the IMF website. Last Updated: July 12, 2024 The External Sector Report analyzes global external developments and provides multilaterally consistent assessments of external positions of the world’s largest economies, representing over 90 percent of global GDP. The report includes: (i) an overview chapter that emphasizes multilateral issues, showing how individual economies fit into the global picture and discussing associated risks and policies needed to reduce excess imbalances; (ii) an analytical chapter that covers topics relevant to the analysis of external sector dynamics and adjustment mechanisms; and (ii) a final chapter that provides details of the external assessment of each of the 30 economies considered. The External Sector Report, produced annually since 2012, is a key part of the IMF’s surveillance. External assessments are arrived at by integrating multilateral and country-specific perspectives, while ensuring individual economy assessments add up to a coherent, multilaterally consistent view. Specifically, staff assessments draw on estimates from the External Balance Assessment approach as well as country-specific evidence and judgment, while acknowledging the uncertainties inherent in such assessment (see IMF Blog on Assessing Global Imbalances: The Nuts and Bolts for more details). The External Balance Assessment (EBA) approach, and its different vintages, is used as an input to the staff assessments of current accounts and real exchange rates. The objective of the EBA approach is to inform a normative evaluation, taking account of the effects of policies and potential policy distortions. In contrast to analyses that seek to predict future values of current accounts and exchange rates, EBA seeks to identify levels that would be consistent with country fundamental characteristics and desirable settings of relevant policies. EBA strips out the influence of cyclical factors and allows one to estimate the impact on a country's current account and real exchange rate of potential policy distortions in the areas of fiscal policy, social protection (public health expenditure in particular), capital controls, reserve accumulation, financial policies, and monetary policy. The approach estimates the impact of both domestic and foreign influences on an economy’s current account and exchange rate. The data inputs and estimates of the EBA model are available online.",2025-07-19,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/External-Sector-Reports#sort=@imfdate descending,International Monetary Fund,imf.org,"economics, monetary policy, global finance, IMF reports"

Regional Economic Outlook,"The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. Growth is projected to rise in the Middle East and North Africa in 2025 and 2026, but at a slower pace than anticipated in the October 2024 REO. Across the region, rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty are adding to the impact of conflicts and extended oil production cuts to weaken growth prospects. In the Caucasus and Central Asia, growth has been robust but is set to moderate to a more sustainable pace. Policymakers must adapt to the new environment, prioritizing macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural reforms to seize global opportunities. We expect growth to strengthen in 2025 and 2026 in the Middle East and North Africa, but at a slower pace than anticipated in October. In the Caucasus and Central Asia, growth has been robust but is expected to moderate to a more sustainable pace. Rising trade tensions and exceptional global policy uncertainty are adding to the impact of conflicts and extended oil production cuts to weaken growth prospects in both regions. The outlook is subject to significant uncertainty and downside risks. Policymakers must adapt to this new environment by prioritizing macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural reforms to seize global opportunities. Global  uncertainty—related to the frequency of shocks and policy volatility—has risen significantly over recent decades, surging this year. This chapter presents the first empirical analysis of the drivers and economic effects of uncertainty in the MENA and CCA regions. Global and regional factors account for much of the variation in uncertainty, particularly in the CCA region and Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Country-specific factors (related to conflicts, political instability, climate shocks, and disease outbreaks) also contribute to uncertainty. The findings indicate that a persistent spike in global uncertainty can have large negative effects on real output, with losses of 2.5 percent after two years. The economic impacts of uncertainty are more pronounced in the MENA and CCA regions than elsewhere, partly reflecting greater vulnerabilities like higher public debt and weaker institutions. The results highlight the need for strengthening policy buffers and implementing structural reforms to enhance economic resilience and mitigate the effects of uncertainty.

World Economic Outlook,"The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. After enduring a prolonged and unprecedented series of shocks, the global economy appeared to have stabilized, with steady yet underwhelming growth rates. However, the landscape has changed as governments around the world reorder policy priorities and uncertainties have climbed to new highs. Forecasts for global growth have been revised markedly down compared with the January 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update, reflecting effective tariff rates at levels not seen in a century and a highly unpredictable environment. Global headline inflation is expected to decline at a slightly slower pace than what was expected in January. Intensifying downside risks dominate the outlook, amid escalating trade tensions and financial market adjustments. Divergent and swiftly changing policy positions or deteriorating sentiment could lead to even tighter global financial conditions.  Ratcheting up a trade war and heightened trade policy uncertainty may further hinder both short-term and long-term growth prospects. Scaling back international cooperation could jeopardize progress toward a more resilient global economy. At this critical juncture, countries should work constructively to promote a stable and predictable trade environment and to facilitate international cooperation, while addressing policy gaps and structural imbalances at home. This will help secure both internal and external economic stability. To stimulate growth and ease fiscal pressures, policies that promote healthy aging and enhance labor force participation among older individuals and women could be implemented, as discussed in Chapter 2. Additionally, productivity growth can be fostered with better integration of migrants and refugees and mitigation of skill mismatches, as detailed in Chapter 3. The estimates and projections in the April 2025 WEO Chapter 1 and Statistical Appendix are based on statistical information available through April 14, 2025, but may not reflect the latest published data in all cases. Global growth is projected to decline after a period of steady but underwhelming performance, amid policy shifts and new uncertainties. Global headline inflation is expected to decline further, notwithstanding upward revisions in some countries. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Escalating trade tensions and elevated policy-induced uncertainty may further hinder growth. Shifting policies could lead to abrupt tightening of global financial conditions and capital outflows, particularly impacting emerging markets. Demographic shifts threaten fiscal sustainability, while the recent cost-of-living crisis may reignite social unrest. More limited international development assistance could push low-income countries deeper into debt, jeopardizing living standards. At this critical juncture, policies need to be calibrated to foster international cooperation while ensuring internal economic stability, thereby helping reduce global imbalances.",2025-07-19,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/04/22/world-economic-outlook-april-2025?cid=ca-com-compd-pubs_rotator-SM2025-WEOEA2025001,International Monetary Fund,imf.org,"economics, monetary policy, global finance, IMF reports"

Global Financial Stability Report,"The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. Against the heightened volatility of asset prices, Chapter 1 assesses that global financial stability risks have increased significantly. This assessment is supported by three key forward-looking vulnerabilities: (i) valuations remain high in some key markets; (ii) some highly leveraged financial institutions and their nexus with banking systems; and (iii) risks of market turmoil and challenges to debt sustainability for highly indebted sovereigns. Chapter 2 shows that major geopolitical risk events can trigger a significant decline in stock prices and raise sovereign risk premiums, thereby posing a potential threat to macro-financial stability.    
 
The assessments and analyses in this GFSR are based on financial market data available to IMF staff through April 15, 2025, but may not reflect published data by that date in all cases. Chapter 1 assesses that global financial stability risks have increased significantly as global financial conditions tightened and economic and trade policy uncertainty remain elevated. This assessment is also supported by three key forward-looking vulnerabilities. First, despite the recent turmoil, valuations remain high in some key segments, meaning that adjustments in valuations could go further if the outlook were to deteriorate. The resulting further tightening of global financial conditions could significantly impact emerging markets’ currencies, asset prices, and capital flows. Second, some financial institutions could come under strain in volatile markets, especially highly leveraged ones. As the hedge fund and asset management sectors grew, so have their aggregate leverage levels and the nexus with the banking sector, raising the specter of weakly managed NBFIs being pushed to deleverage when they face margin calls and redemptions. Third, further turbulence could descend upon sovereign bond markets, especially in jurisdictions where government debt levels are high. More challenged market functioning and the unwinding of popular leveraged trades in core sovereign bond markets could contribute to further volatility. Emerging market economies already facing the highest real financing costs in a decade may now need to refinance their debt and fund fiscal spending at higher costs. Overall, investor concerns about public debt sustainability and other fragilities in the financial sector can worsen in a mutually reinforcing fashion. Geopolitical risk events generally exert a modest influence on asset prices. However, major events, such as military conflicts, can lead to substantial decline in stock prices and raise sovereign risk premiums. The impact is particularly pronounced in emerging markets that have limited fiscal space or international reserve buffers. Geopolitical risks can also propagate to other countries through trade and financial linkages. While investors appear to price geopolitical risk into equity and option markets to some extent, the materialization of these risks can trigger financial market volatility. A sudden, major geopolitical risk event could also weigh on the stability of banks and nonbank financial institutions, potentially posing a risk to macrofinancial stability. To mitigate financial stability risks arising from geopolitical events, financial institutions and their oversight bodies should allocate sufficient resources to identify, quantify, and manage these risks, including through stress testing and scenario analysis. Emerging market and developing economies should continue efforts to develop and deepen financial markets and maintain adequate fiscal policy space and international reserves to cushion against adverse geopolitical shocks.",2025-07-19,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2025/04/22/global-financial-stability-report-april-2025?cid=ca-com-compd-pubs_belt,International Monetary Fund,imf.org,"economics, monetary policy, global finance, IMF reports"
Fiscal Monitor,"The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. Credit: IMF Photo | Andrew Caballero-Reynolds, Accra in Ghana Escalating uncertainty and policy shifts are reshaping the fiscal outlook. Global public debt projections have been revised upwards, while tariffs, market volatility, increased defense spending, and challenging foreign aid are intensifying risks. Countries must implement gradual fiscal adjustments within credible medium-term frameworks, reducing debt and building buffers against heightened uncertainty. This chapter examines strategies to build public support for reforms to energy subsidies and public pensions, which are crucial for reducing fiscal vulnerabilities and fostering inclusive growth. Energy subsidy reforms enhance efficiency and reduce inequality, while pension reforms ensure sustainability and alleviate old-age poverty. Resistance arises because costs are tangible, while benefits are diffuse. The chapter introduces a real-time measure of reform acceptability using large language models to quantify stakeholder sentiment. Findings show that careful design, timing, accompanying measures, and governance improve stakeholder sentiment and help advance ambitious and durable reforms. Redistribution policies and strategic communications can mitigate resistance.

External Sector Report,"The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. This year’s report provides the external sector assessment of 30 of the world’s largest economies on the basis of their 2023 data. With tight monetary policy conditions in key advanced economies continuing in 2023, the US dollar remained strong in 2023 and early 2024 by historical standards, while other reserve currency movements have been mixed. Net capital inflows to emerging market and developing economies recovered slightly from the lows experienced in 2022 but remained negative in 2023. Gross inflows and outflows in emerging markets declined, however. Against this background, the global current account balance (defined as the cross-country sum of absolute values of current account) narrowed significantly in 2023, while the excess global current account balance (in excess of the current account norms) has remained broadly unchanged relative to 2022. The report also analyzes the historical pattern in the external sector implications of energy price swings. Energy-importing countries are exposed to adverse effects of negative oil supply shocks but can adopt several policy measures to soften the impact. Possible implications of the clean energy transition and the evolving correlation between the oil price and US dollar are discussed. Lastly, the report contains external sector assessments of individual economies, which are based on a wide range of methods including a multilaterally consistent model of current accounts. The US dollar strength persisted in 2023, with the currency remaining close to its post-2000 peak. Net capital inflows to emerging markets remained negative in 2023, albeit recovering slightly relative to 2022, driven by net outflows from China. The global current account balance narrowed significantly in 2023, moderating toward pre-COVID-19 levels. The narrowing reflected a reversal of large current account surpluses in commodity exporting countries, as commodity prices declined. Continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a slowdown in global trade in goods during 2023 also contributed. In 2024 and over the medium term the global current account balance is expected to narrow slightly more, as CA deficit countries embark on fiscal consolidation and commodity prices moderate. Staff assessment suggests excess global current account balances remained broadly unchanged since 2022. Commodity prices are subject to large and recurrent volatility. This chapter explores the external sector implications of energy price swings for the global economy and individual countries, differentiating among drivers behind the price swings as well as accounting for countries’ energy importer or exporter status. Energy-importing economies bear the brunt of negative oil supply shocks. Nonetheless, they can resort to several policy tools to mitigate the adverse effects. Two newly emerging challenges arise from the clean energy transition and the possible shift in the correlation between the oil price and the US dollar. The individual economy assessments use a wide range of methods to form an integrated and multilaterally consistent view of economies’ external sector positions. These methods are grounded in the latest vintage of the External Balance Assessment (EBA), developed by the IMF to estimate desired current account balances and real exchange rates. Model estimates and associated discussions on policy distortions are complemented by a holistic view of other external indicators. The policy discussion in the individual economy assessments highlights policies and reforms that contribute to convergence toward (or maintenance of) external balance.",2025-07-19,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/ESR/Issues/2024/07/12/external-sector-report-2024,International Monetary Fund,imf.org,"economics, monetary policy, global finance, IMF reports"

                                        Update","The IMF Press Center is a password-protected site for working journalists. Global growth is projected at 3.3 percent both in 2025 and 2026, below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.7 percent. The forecast for 2025 is broadly unchanged from that in the October 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO), primarily on account of an upward revision in the United States offsetting downward revisions in other major economies. Global headline inflation is expected to decline to 4.2 percent in 2025 and to 3.5 percent in 2026, converging back to target earlier in advanced economies than in emerging market and developing economies. Medium-term risks to the baseline are tilted to the downside, while the near-term outlook is characterized by divergent risks. Upside risks could lift already-robust growth in the United States in the short run, whereas risks in other countries are on the downside amid elevated policy uncertainty. Policy-generated disruptions to the ongoing disinflation process could interrupt the pivot to easing monetary policy, with implications for fiscal sustainability and financial stability. Managing these risks requires a keen policy focus on balancing trade-offs between inflation and real activity, rebuilding buffers, and lifting medium-term growth prospects through stepped-up structural reforms as well as stronger multilateral rules and cooperation.

Chapter 1 looks at the implications of the war in Ukraine on the financial system. Commodity prices pose challenging trade-offs for central banks. Many emerging and frontier markets are facing especially difficult conditions. In China, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated amid ongoing stress in the property sector and new COVID-19 outbreaks. Central banks should act decisively to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched without jeopardizing the recovery. Policymakers will need to confront the structural issues brought to the fore by the war, including the trade-off between energy security and climate transition. Chapter 2 discusses the sovereign-bank nexus in emerging markets. Bank holdings of domestic sovereign bonds have surged in emerging markets during the pandemic. With public debt at historically high levels and the sovereign credit outlook deteriorating, there is a risk of a negative feedback loop that could threaten macro-financial stability. Chapter 3 examines the challenges to financial stability posed by the rapid rise of risky business segments in fintech. Policies that target both fintech firms and incumbent banks proportionately are needed. Financial conditions have tightened and risks to the global economy have increased as a result of the war in Ukraine. Soaring commodity prices pose challenging trade-offs for central banks. Many emerging and frontier markets are facing especially difficult conditions. In China, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated amid ongoing stress in the property sector and new COVID-19 outbreaks. Central banks should act decisively to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched without jeopardizing the recovery and address financial vulnerabilities. Policymakers should intensify their efforts to implement the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) road map while taking appropriate steps to address energy security concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the relationship between sovereigns and banks—the so-called sovereign-bank nexus—in emerging market economies to the fore as bank holdings of domestic sovereign debt have surged. This chapter examines the empirical relevance of this nexus to assess how it could amplify macro-financial stability risks. The analysis finds that an increase in sovereign credit risk can adversely affect banks’ balance sheets and credit supply, especially in countries with less-well-capitalized banking systems. Sovereign distress can also constrain funding for the nonfinancial corporate sector and reduce its capital expenditure. As global financial conditions tighten and geopolitical tensions intensify, a deeper nexus makes policy trade-offs in emerging markets more complex. Potential policy responses are discussed. Fintech can increase efficiency and competition and broaden access to financial services. However, the fast growth of fintech firms into risky business segments—and their inadequate regulation and interconnectedness with the traditional financial system—can have financial stability implications. This chapter explores three key types of fintech to illustrate these risks: digital banks (“neobanks”), long-established fintech firms in the US mortgage market, and decentralized finance (“DeFi”). The chapter argues that policies targeting fintech and traditional financial firms proportionally are needed. In the case of DeFi, regulations should focus on the elements of the crypto ecosystem that enable it, such as stablecoin issuers and centralized exchanges.",2025-07-19,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2022/04/19/global-financial-stability-report-april-2022,International Monetary Fund,imf.org,"economics, monetary policy, global finance, IMF reports"

Navigating Challenging Transitions Financial stability risks have been contained so far, reflecting ongoing policy support and a rebound in the global economy earlier this year. Chapter 1 explains that financial conditions have eased further in net in advanced economies but changed little in emerging markets. However, the optimism that propelled markets earlier in the year has faded on growing concerns about the strength of the global recovery, and ongoing supply chain disruptions intensified inflation concerns. Signs of stretched asset valuations in some market segments persist, and pockets of vulnerabilities remain in the nonbank financial sector; recovery is uneven in the corporate sector. Chapter 2 discusses the opportunities and challenges of the crypto ecosystem. Crypto asset providers’ lack of operational or cyber resilience poses risks, and significant data gaps imperil financial integrity. Crypto assets in emerging markets may accelerate dollarization risks. Chapter 3 shows that sustainable funds can support the global transition to a green economy but must be scaled up to have a major impact. It also discusses how a disorderly transition could disrupt the broader investment fund sector in the future. As the world continues to navigate the pandemic, financial stability risks have been contained so far thanks to the ongoing policy support. However, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated in several sectors. Concerns about upside risks to the inflation outlook persist and asset valuations are stretched in some market segments. Emerging and frontier markets continue to face large financing needs amid higher funding costs. Risks are also rising at some nonbank financial institutions as they reach for yield to meet return targets. The crypto ecosystem offers an exciting new world of opportunities but also challenges. Risks to consumers can arise from a lack of operational or cyber resilience associated with crypto asset providers. Anonymity and limited global standards create significant data gaps for regulators and pose risks to financial integrity. The advent of crypto assets and stablecoins in emerging market and developing economies may accelerate dollarization risks. The chapter concludes with a set of eight actionable policy recommendations. This chapter analyzes the role that the global investment fund sector can play to support the urgently needed transition to a green economy, as well as the risks to the sector arising from this transition. The chapter’s findings suggest that policymakers should strengthen the global climate information architecture to foster climate finance markets, ensure proper regulatory oversight to prevent greenwashing, and conduct scenario analysis and stress testing to mitigate financial stability risks.",2025-07-19,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2021/10/12/global-financial-stability-report-october-2021,International Monetary Fund,imf.org,"economics, monetary policy, global finance, IMF reports"
