Investopedia,Qualified Opinion: Definition and Place in Auditor’s Report,"Close
What Is a Qualified Opinion?
A qualified opinion is a statement issued in an
auditor’s report
that accompanies a company’s audited financial statements. It is an
auditor’s opinion
that suggests the financial information provided by a company was limited in scope or there was a material issue with regard to the application of
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
—but one that is not pervasive.
Qualified opinions may also be issued if a company has inadequate disclosures in the
footnotes to the financial statements
.
Key Takeaways
A qualified opinion is one of four possible auditor’s opinions on a company’s financial statement.
The other auditor’s opinions are unqualified, adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion.
A qualified opinion indicates that there was either a scope limitation, an issue discovered in the audit of the financials that was not pervasive, or an inadequate footnote disclosure.
A qualified opinion is an auditor’s opinion that the financials are fairly presented, with the exception of a specified area.
Unlike an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, a qualified opinion is generally still acceptable to lenders, creditors, and investors.
The auditor’s opinion is usually found in the third and final section of an auditor’s report.
Understanding a Qualified Opinion
A qualified opinion may be given when a company’s financial records have not followed GAAP in all financial transactions, but only if the deviation from GAAP is not pervasive. The term “pervasive” can be interpreted differently based on an auditor’s professional judgment. However, to not be pervasive, the misstatement must not misrepresent the factual financial position of the company as a whole and should not affect the decision making of financial statement users.
A qualified opinion may also be given due to a limitation of scope in which the auditor was not able to gather sufficient evidence to support various aspects of the financial statements. Without sufficient verification of transactions, an
unqualified opinion
may not be given. Inadequate disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, estimation uncertainty, or the lack of a
statement of cash flows
are also grounds for a qualified opinion.
How a Qualified Opinion Is Represented
A qualified opinion is listed in the third and final section of an auditor’s report. The first section of the report outlines management’s responsibilities in regard to preparing the financial statements and maintaining
internal controls
. The second section outlines the auditor’s responsibilities. In the third section, an opinion is given by the
independent auditor
regarding the company’s internal controls and accounting records. The opinion may be unqualified, qualified, adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion.
A qualified opinion states that the
financial statements
of a corporate client are, with the exception of a specified area, fairly presented. Auditors typically qualify the auditor’s report with a statement such as “except for the following,” when they have insufficient information to verify certain aspects of the transactions and reports being audited.
A qualified opinion is not so severe that it indicates that a business is doing poorly or that a company has hidden or falsified information, but rather, that the auditor simply cannot give an issue-free report. The auditor may specify that they believe the overall audit to be true and factual, but will specify the area that they believe is the issue.
Qualified Opinion vs. Other Opinions
A qualified opinion is a reflection of the
auditor
’s inability to give an unqualified, or clean, audit opinion. An unqualified opinion is issued if the financial statements are presumed to be free from material misstatements. It is the most common type of auditor’s opinion.
If the issues discovered during the audit result in material misstatements that would affect the decision making of the financial statement users, the opinion is escalated to an
adverse opinion
. The adverse opinion results in the company needing to restate and complete another audit of its financial statements. A qualified opinion is still acceptable to most lenders, creditors, and investors.
If the auditor is unable to complete the audit report due to the absence of financial records or insufficient cooperation from management, the auditor issues a disclaimer of opinion. This is an indication that no opinion over the financial statements was able to be determined.
How Many Auditor’s Opinions Are Possible on a Financial Statement?
Four auditor’s opinions are possible on a company’s financial statement. The opinions are qualified, unqualified, adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion.
When May a Qualified Opinion Be Issued?
A qualified opinion may be given when a company’s financial records have not followed GAAP in all financial transactions—however, the deviation from GAAP must not be pervasive. To not be pervasive, the misstatement must not misrepresent the company’s factual financial position as a whole and should not affect the financial statement users’ decision making.
Where Is a Qualified Opinion in an Auditor’s Report?
An auditor’s report contains three sections:
The first section outlines management’s responsibilities about preparing the financial statements and maintaining internal controls.
The second section outlines the auditor’s responsibilities.
The third section contains an opinion given by the independent auditor regarding the company’s internal controls and accounting records. This is where a qualified opinion (or unqualified or adverse, or a disclaimer of opinion) is listed.
The Bottom Line
A statement issued in an auditor’s report that accompanies a company’s audited financial statements is called a qualified opinion. The auditor’s opinion suggests the financial information provided by the company was limited in scope or there was a material—but not pervasive—issue regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Investopedia,Total Expense Ratio (TER): Definition and How to Calculate,"Close
Definition
The TER covers the annual costs of running a fund based on all the known expenses associated with the fund’s operation.
What Is the Total Expense Ratio (TER)?
The total expense ratio (TER) is a measure of the total costs associated with managing and operating an
investment fund
such as a mutual fund. This expense ratio is the fee charged to investors. These costs consist primarily of
management fees
and additional expenses such as trading fees, legal fees, auditor fees, and other operational expenses.
The total cost of the fund is divided by the fund’s total
assets
to arrive at a percentage amount, which represents the TER. The TER is also known as the net expense ratio or
after reimbursement expense ratio
.
Key Takeaways
The expense ratio is the fee paid by those who invest in a fund.
It is a measure of a fund’s
operational efficiency
.
Investors pay attention to the expense ratio to determine if a fund is an appropriate investment for them after fees are considered.
TER is also known as the net expense ratio or after reimbursement expense ratio.
How the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Works
The size of the TER is important to investors as the costs are withdrawn from the fund, affecting investors’
returns
. For example, if a fund generates a return of 7% for the year but has a TER of 4%, then the 7% gain is greatly diminished to 3%.
The TER provides a way for the annual costs of running a particular fund to be covered. It takes all of the known costs associated with the fund’s operation and expresses them as a single number, generally as a percentage, drawing its basis from the assets associated with the fund. This means that the gross amount paid by investors as the TER is dependent on the size of the fund.
The funds supplied through the TER are used to support the management, trading, and legal fees associated with the fund, as well as any
audit
costs or general
operating expenses
. Anytime a fund incurs higher or lower operating expenses, those changes are likely passed along within the TER.
The more
actively managed
the fund, the higher the associated TER. This is due to increased personnel costs, as well as increased transaction-based fees—the fund manager pays a
brokerage fee
each time a buy and sell trade is executed. By comparison, an automated or
passive
fund has significantly lower costs of operation, resulting in a lower TER.
Total Expense Ratio (TER) Formula and Calculation
Below is the formula and the steps to calculate the TER:
TER formula.
Investopedia
To calculate the TER:
Obtain the total assets of the fund, which can be derived from financial disclosures that
mutual funds
report to regulators or are disseminated to analysts and investors via a
prospectus
. This information can usually be found easily on the fund's webpage as well.
Obtain the total costs from the prospectus, which can be more challenging since the TER accounts for all costs associated with operating the investment fund, including trading costs, management costs, and overhead and administration costs (such as
12b-1 fees
, which are the costs of marketing the fund).
Understanding Operating Expenses
Operating expenses, or
operating costs
, cover any outgoing financial obligations associated with the management of the fund and the corresponding transactions. This can include employee compensation and brokerage fees, in addition to any
accountant
fees.
Other common expenses include
shareholder
communications and
financial statements
, record-keeping mechanisms, and custodial services from the overseeing organization or asset manager.
A small percentage of the TER may be directed to other business operation costs. This can include expenses as simple as space rental and utilities for the business. Often, these expenses are referred to as
overhead
and include any financial obligation that is not necessarily directed to the actual production of a good or service.
How Does the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Differ From the Gross Expense Ratio (GER)?
The
gross expense ratio (GER)
is the total percentage of a mutual fund’s assets that are devoted to running the fund. In some cases, a fund may have agreements in place for waiving, reimbursing, or recouping some of the fund’s fees. This is often the case for new funds. An investment company and its fund managers may agree to waive certain fees following the launch of a new fund to keep the expense ratio lower for investors.
The TER represents the
fees
charged to the fund after any waivers, reimbursements, and recoupments have been made. These fee reductions are typically for a specified time frame, after which the fund may incur all full costs.
What Are the Limitations of the TER?
The TER is meant to capture the entire cost that an investor can expect from owning an investment fund. However, some charges, especially those that are either made only once or made from the investment capital, may not be included in the TER. These include
commission
, stockbroker fees, securities transfer tax, redemption fees, and sales load charges.
The Bottom Line
The total expense ratio (TER) can help an investor understand the costs associated with investing in a particular
investment fund
. This can be a measure of the fund's efficiency and help to see if it's an appropriate investment.

What Is a Trust?
A trust is a legal entity with separate and distinct rights, similar to a person or corporation. In a trust, a party known as a trustor gives another party, a trustee, the right to hold title to and manage property or assets for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary.
Trusts can be established to provide legal protection for the trustor’s assets to ensure they are distributed according to their wishes. Additionally, a trust can help an estate avoid taxes and
probate
. It can protect assets from
creditors
and dictate the terms of inheritance for beneficiaries.
Key Takeaways
A trust is a fiduciary relationship in which a trustor gives another party, known as a trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party.
While they are generally associated with wealthy people, trusts are highly versatile instruments that can be used for various purposes to achieve specific goals.
Each trust falls into six broad categories: living or testamentary, funded or unfunded, revocable or irrevocable.
Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin
Understanding Trusts
A trustor creates a trust with the help of an attorney. The trustor's assets are transferred to a
trustee
. This trustee holds on to the assets for the beneficiary or beneficiaries.
The rules of a trust depend on the terms on which it was built.
A trust can be used to determine how a person’s money should be managed and distributed while that person is alive or after their death.

A trust is one way to provide for an underage beneficiary. Once the beneficiary is deemed capable of managing their assets, they will receive possession of the assets held in trust.
Categories of Trusts
Although there are many different types of trusts, each fits into one or more of the following categories:
1
Living or testamentary
Revocable or irrevocable
Funded or unfunded
Living or Testamentary
A
living trust
, also called an
inter-vivos trust
, is a written document in which an individual's assets are provided as a trust for the individual's use and benefit during their lifetime. A trustee is named when the trust is established; this person is in charge of handling the affairs of the trust and transferring the assets to the beneficiaries at the time of the trustor's death.
A
testamentary trust
, also called a will trust, specifies how an individual's assets are designated after the trustor's death. It is not established until after the trustor dies.
Revocable or Irrevocable
A
revocable trust
can be changed or terminated by the trustor during that person's lifetime.
2
An irrevocable trust, as the name implies, cannot be changed once it's established.
Living trusts can be revocable or irrevocable. Testamentary trusts are generally irrevocable once established but can be revocable via a will if the trustor is still alive. The fact that it is unalterable, containing assets that have been permanently moved out of the
trustor's
possession, is what allows
estate
taxes to be minimized or avoided altogether.
Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang
Funded or Unfunded
With a funded trust, a trustor places assets into the trust during their lifetime. An unfunded trust consists only of the trust agreement with no funding. Unfunded trusts can become funded upon the trustor’s death or remain unfunded. Since an unfunded trust exposes assets to many of the perils a trust is designed to avoid, ensuring proper funding is important.
Common Purposes for Trusts
The trust fund is an ancient instrument dating back to feudal times. Though many think trusts are only for wealthy people, the fact is that trusts are highly versatile vehicles that can
protect assets and direct them into the right hands
long after the original asset owner's death.
A trust is generally
employed to hold assets
so that they are safe from creditors or others that might have a claim on them after the trustor's death. In addition, trusts are often used to keep assets safe from family members who might otherwise sell or spend them. Assets may be placed in trust for trustworthy family members—even a relative with the best intentions could face a lawsuit, divorce, or other misfortune, putting those assets at risk.
Trusts can also be used to secure assets for specific purposes, such as a beneficiary's education or to help them start a business.
Beneficiary Care
Trusts may seem geared primarily toward high-net-worth individuals and families, since they can be expensive to establish and maintain. However, those of more average means may find them useful. For example, trusts can be established to ensure that a dependent with a physical disability or mental health condition receives care.
Fast Fact
Some trusts are created so that a beneficiary may qualify for
Medicaid
and still preserve at least a portion of their wealth.
Privacy
Some individuals use trusts because they keep details about assets private. In many jurisdictions, the terms of a will are public. A trust can accomplish what a will does, but in a more private manner.
Estate Planning
Trusts can also be used for
estate planning
. Typically, a deceased individual's assets are passed to the spouse and then equally divided among the surviving children. However, children who are under the age of 18 need to have trustees. The trustees only have control over the assets until the children reach adulthood.
Trusts can also be used for tax planning. In some cases, the tax consequences of using trusts are lower than other alternatives. Because of this, trusts have become a staple in tax planning for individuals and corporations.
Tax Saving Basis
Assets in a revocable trust benefit from a
step-up in basis
, which can mean
substantial tax savings for the heirs
who eventually inherit from the trust. However, if the assets are placed in an irrevocable trust, they are subject to carryover basis, or their original
cost basis
.
Here's an example of how the stepped-up basis calculation works, using stocks: The original cost of shares was $5,000. The shares were placed into a revocable trust and passed on to a beneficiary. At the time the stocks were passed on, they were worth $10,000, so they have a step-up in basis of $10,000. Had the same beneficiary received them as a gift when the original owner was still alive, their basis would be $5,000. The difference is key when calculating taxes.
So, if the trust beneficiary sold the shares for $12,000, they would owe tax on a $2,000 gain. A beneficiary given the shares, or one who had a carryover basis, would owe taxes on a gain of $7,000 ($5,000 plus $2,000). Note that the step-up basis applies to inherited assets in general, not just those that involve a trust.
Types of Trust Funds
Below is a list of some of the more common types of trust funds.
Credit shelter trust
: Sometimes called a bypass trust or family trust, this trust allows a person to bequeath an amount up to (but not over) the
estate tax
exemption. The rest of the estate passes to a spouse tax-free. Funds placed in a credit shelter trust are forever free of estate taxes, even if they grow.
Generation-skipping trust
: This trust allows a person to transfer assets tax-free to beneficiaries at least two generations their junior, typically their grandchildren.
Qualified personal residence trust
: This trust removes a person's home (or vacation home) from their estate. This could be helpful if the properties are likely to appreciate significantly.
Insurance trust
: This irrevocable trust shelters a life insurance policy within a trust, thus removing it from a taxable estate.
3
While a person may no longer borrow against the policy or change beneficiaries, proceeds can be used to pay estate costs after a person dies.
Qualified terminable interest property trust
: This trust allows a person to direct assets to specific beneficiaries at different times. In the typical scenario, a spouse will receive lifelong income from the trust, and children will get what’s left after the spouse dies.
Separate share trust
: This trust lets a parent establish a trust with different features for each beneficiary.
A spendthrift trust
: This trust protects the assets a person places in the trust from being claimed by creditors. It also allows for the management of the assets by an independent trustee and forbids the",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp

Definition
A free trade agreement between two or more countries reduces or eliminates certain costs and obstacles in order to more freely facilitate the exchange of goods and services.
What Is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA)?
A free trade agreement is an arrangement where two or more countries commit to opening up their markets to one another by lowering or removing tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, making it easier for goods and services to move between them.
The concept of free trade is the opposite of trade
protectionism
or economic isolationism.
Key Takeaways
Free trade agreements reduce or eliminate barriers to trade across international borders.
When implemented, these agreements come with regulations and oversight in the U.S. and the E.U.
Free trade can be applied based on two models: mercantilism and comparative advantage.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
How a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Works
Free trade policy is often implemented by a formal and mutual agreement of the nations involved. A free-trade policy may simply be the absence of any trade restrictions, however.
A government doesn't have to take specific action to promote free trade. This hands-off stance is referred to as “
laissez-faire
trade” or trade liberalization.
Governments with free-trade policies or agreements in place don't necessarily abandon all control of imports and exports or eliminate all protectionist policies. Few free trade agreements (FTAs) result in completely free trade in modern international trade.

Important
The benefits of free trade were outlined in ""On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,"" published
by economist David Ricardo in 1817.
1
For example, a nation might allow free trade with another nation, with exceptions that forbid the import of specific drugs not approved by its regulators, animals that have not been vaccinated, or processed foods that do not meet its standards.
It might also have policies in place that exempt specific products from tariff-free status to protect home producers from foreign competition in their industries.
The Economics of Free Trade
Free trade on the international level is no different from trade between neighbors, towns, or states. It allows businesses in each country or location to focus on producing and selling the goods that best use their resources. Other businesses import goods that are scarce or unavailable domestically. This mix of local production and foreign trade allows countries to experience faster growth while better meeting the needs of their consumers.
This view was first popularized in 1817 by economist David Ricardo in his book, ""On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation."" He argued that free trade expands diversity and lowers the prices of goods available in a nation while better exploiting its homegrown resources, knowledge, and specialized skills.
1
Free Trade Models
Free trade can be applied based on two models.
Mercantilism
Global trade was dominated by the theory of mercantilism before the 1800s. This theory placed priority on having a favorable balance of trade relative to other countries and accumulating more gold and silver.
Countries would often place trade barriers like taxes and tariffs to discourage their residents from purchasing foreign goods to attain a favorable balance of trade. This incentivized consumers to purchase locally-made products and support domestic industries.
Comparative Advantage
Ricardo introduced the law of
comparative advantage
, which states that countries can attain the maximum benefits through free trade. Ricardo demonstrated that countries would be able to produce more goods in total than they would by limiting trade if they prioritized producing the goods that they could produce more cheaply than other countries, and where they have a comparative advantage.
2
Advantages and Disadvantages of Free Trade
Free trade comes with both pros and cons.
Rapid Development
Free trade has allowed many countries to attain rapid economic growth. Many countries have been able to attract foreign investment capital and provide relatively high-paying jobs for local workers by
focusing on exports
and resources where they have a strong comparative advantage.
Lower Global Prices
Free trade creates a competitive environment for consumers where countries strive to provide the lowest possible prices for their resources. This, in turn, allows manufacturers to provide lower prices for finished goods and ultimately increases the buying power of all consumers.
Unemployment and Business Losses
There are, nonetheless, some economic losers when a country opens its borders to free trade. Domestic industries might be unable to compete with foreign competitors, causing local unemployment. Large-scale industries might move to countries with lax environmental and labor laws, resulting in child labor or pollution.
Increased Dependency on the Global Market
Free trade can also make countries more dependent on the global market. The prices of some goods may be lower in the world market, but there are strategic benefits for a country that produces those goods domestically. The country might be forced to rebuild these industries from scratch in the event of a war or crisis.
Free Trade Pros and Cons
Pros
Allows consumers to access the cheapest goods on the world market.
Allows countries with relatively cheap labor or resources to benefit from foreign exports.
Under Ricardo's theory, countries can produce more goods collectively by trading on their respective advantages.
Cons
Competition with foreign exports may cause local unemployment and business failures.
Industries may relocate to jurisdictions with lax regulations, causing environmental damage or abusive labor practices.
Countries may become reliant on the global market for key goods, leaving them at a strategic disadvantage in times of crisis.
Public Opinion on Free Trade
Research suggests that economists in the U.S. support free-trade policies at significantly higher rates than the general public.
American economist
Milton Friedman
said, “The economics profession has been almost unanimous on the subject of the desirability of free trade.”
3
Free-trade policies haven't been as popular with the general public. The key issues include unfair competition from countries where lower labor costs allow price-cutting and a loss of good-paying jobs to manufacturers abroad.
Fast Fact
The call on the public to ""Buy American"" may get louder or quieter with the political winds, but it never goes silent.
The View From Financial Markets
The financial markets see the other side of the coin. Free trade is an opportunity to open another part of the world to domestic producers. It's an integral part of the financial system and the investing world. American investors have access to most foreign financial markets and a wider range of securities, currencies, and other financial products.
Completely free trade in the financial markets is unlikely in our times, however. There are many supranational regulatory organizations for world financial markets, including the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
, the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
, and the Committee on Capital Movements and Invisible Transactions.
Examples of Free Trade Agreements
The U.S. and the European Union provide notable examples of free trade.
European Union
The member nations of the
European Union
form an essentially borderless single entity for trade, and the adoption of the euro by most of those nations smooths the way further.
4
5
It should be noted that this system is regulated by a central bureaucracy that must manage the many trade-related issues that come up between representatives of member nations.
6
U.S. Free Trade Agreements
The United States has several free trade agreements in place. They include multi-nation agreements such as the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(USMCA), which covers Canada and Mexico, and the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which includes Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. There are also separate trade agreements with nations from Australia to Peru.

What Is a Home Equity Loan?
A home equity loan—also known as an equity loan, home equity installment loan, or
second mortgage
—is a type of consumer debt. Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes. The loan amount is based on the difference between the home’s current market value and the
homeowner’s mortgage balance due
. Home equity loans tend to be fixed-rate, while the typical alternative,
home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)
, generally have variable rates.
Key Takeaways
A home equity loan, also known as a home equity installment loan or a second
mortgage
, is a type of consumer debt.
Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their residence.
Home equity loan amounts are based on the difference between a home’s current market value and the homeowner’s mortgage balance due.
Home equity loans come in two varieties: fixed-rate loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).
Fixed-rate home equity loans provide one lump sum, whereas HELOCs offer borrowers revolving lines of credit.
Investopedia / Zoe Hansen
How a Home Equity Loan Works
Essentially, a home equity loan is akin to a mortgage, hence the name second mortgage. The
equity in the home
serves as
collateral
for the
lender
. The amount that a homeowner is allowed to borrow will be based partially on a
combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio
of 80% to 90% of the home’s
appraised
value. Of course, the amount of the loan and the rate of interest charged also depend on the borrower’s
credit score
and payment history.
Warning
Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal.
If you think that you’ve been discriminated against
based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps that you can take. One such step is to file a report with the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
or the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
.
Traditional home equity loans have a set
repayment
term, just
like conventional mortgages
. The borrower makes regular, fixed payments covering both
principal
and
interest
. As with any mortgage, if the loan is not paid off, the home could be sold to satisfy
the remaining debt
.
A home equity loan can be a good way to
convert the equity you’ve built up
in your home into cash, especially if you invest that cash in home renovations that increase the value of your home. However, always remember that you’re putting your home on the line—if real estate values decrease, you could end up owing more than your home is worth.
Should you want to relocate, you might end up losing money on the sale of the home or be unable to move. And if you’re getting the loan
to pay off credit card debt
, resist the temptation to run up those credit card bills again. Before doing something that puts your house in jeopardy, weigh all of your options.
“If considering a home equity loan for a large amount, be sure to
compare rates
on multiple loan types. A
cash-out refinance
may be a better option than a home equity loan, depending on how much you need.”
—
Marguerita Cheng,
CFP, Chief Executive Officer, Blue Ocean Global Wealth
Special Considerations
Home equity loans exploded in popularity after the
Tax Reform Act of 1986
because they provided a way for consumers to get around one of its main provisions: the elimination of deductions for the interest on most consumer purchases. The act left in place one big exception: interest in the service of residence-based debt.
1
However, the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
suspended the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans and HELOCs until 2026—unless, according to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
, “they are used to buy, build or substantially improve the taxpayer’s home that secures the loan.” For example, the interest on a home equity loan
used to consolidate debts
or pay for a child’s college expenses is not tax deductible.
2
As with a mortgage, you can ask for a
good faith estimate
, but before you do, make your own honest estimate of your finances. “You should have a good sense of where your credit and home value are
before applying
, in order to save money,” says
Casey Fleming
, author of
The Loan Guide: How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage
. “Especially on the appraisal [of your home], which is a major expense. If your appraisal comes in too low to support the loan, the money is already spent”—and there are no refunds for not qualifying.
Before signing—especially if you’re using the home equity loan for
debt consolidation
—run the numbers with your bank and make sure that the loan’s
monthly payments
will indeed be lower than the combined payments of all your current obligations. Even though home equity loans have lower interest rates, your term on the new loan could be longer than that of your existing debts.
Important
The interest on a home equity loan is only tax deductible if the loan is used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home that secures the loan.
2
Home Equity Loans vs. HELOCs
Home equity loans provide a single
lump-sum payment
to the borrower, which is repaid over a set period of time (generally five to 15 years) at an
agreed-upon interest rate
. The payment and interest rate remain the same over the lifetime of the loan. The loan must be repaid in full if the home on which it is based is sold.
A HELOC is a revolving line of credit, much like a credit card, that you can draw on as needed, pay back, and then draw on again, for a term determined by the lender. The
draw period
(five to 10 years) is followed by a repayment period when draws are no longer allowed (10 to 20 years). HELOCs typically have a variable interest rate, but some lenders offer
HELOC fixed-rate options
.
Advantages and Disadvantages of a Home Equity Loan
There are a number of key
benefits to home equity loans
, including cost, but there are also drawbacks.
Advantages
Home equity loans provide an easy source of cash and
can be valuable tools for responsible borrowers
. If you have a steady, reliable source of income and know that you will be able to repay the loan, then low-interest rates and possible tax deductions make home equity loans a sensible choice.
Obtaining a home equity loan
is quite simple for many consumers because it is a secured debt. The lender runs a credit check and orders an appraisal of your home to determine your
creditworthiness
and the CLTV.
The interest rate on a home equity loan—although higher than that of a first mortgage—is much lower than that of credit cards and other consumer loans. That helps explain why a primary reason that consumers borrow
against the value of their homes
via a fixed-rate home equity loan is to pay off credit card balances.
Home equity loans are generally a good choice
if you know exactly how much you need to borrow and for what
. You’re guaranteed a certain amount, which you receive in full at closing. “Home equity loans are generally preferred for larger, more expensive goals such as remodeling, paying for higher education, or even debt consolidation because the funds are received in one lump sum,” says
Richard Airey
, senior loan officer with CrossCountry Mortgage LLC in Portland, Maine.
Disadvantages
The main problem with home equity loans is that they can seem an all-too-easy solution for a borrower who may have fallen into a perpetual cycle of spending, borrowing, spending, and sinking deeper into debt. Unfortunately, this scenario is so common that lenders have a term for it:
reloading
, which is basically the habit of taking out a loan to pay off existing debt and free up additional credit, which the
borrower then uses to make additional purchases
.
Reloading leads to a spiraling cycle of debt that often convinces borrowers to turn to home equity loans offering an amount worth 125% of the equity in the borrower’s house. This type of loan often comes with higher
fees
: Because the borrower has taken out more money than the house is worth, the loan is not fully secured by collateral. Also, know that the interest paid on the portion of the loan that is above the value of the home is never tax deductible.
3
When applying for a home equity loan, there can be some temptation to borrow more than you immediately need because you only get the payout once and don’t know if you’ll qualify for another loan in the future.
If you are contemplating a loan worth more than your home, it might be time for a reality check. Were you unable to live within your means when you owed o",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp
Investopedia,What Is Wall Street? Role in Investing and Why It's Famous,"Close
What Is Wall Street?
Wall Street is literally a street located in New York City at the southern end of Manhattan. Figuratively, Wall Street is much more. It's synonymous with the financial industry and the firms within it. This connotation has its roots in the fact that so many brokerages and
investment banks
historically have established their headquarters in and around the street. All the better to be close to the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
.
Being on or near Wall Street is no longer considered essential for financial institutions. In fact, these days they are located all around the country. However, the term ""Wall Street"" still means business—the investment business—and the interests, motivations, and attitudes of its players.
Key Takeaways
Wall Street is a street located in the lower Manhattan section of New York City.
Wall Street is used as an umbrella term to describe the financial markets and the companies that trade publicly on exchanges throughout the U.S.
Historically, Wall Street has been the location of some of the largest U.S. brokerages and investment banking firms, and is also the home of the NYSE.
Wall Street is often contrasted with Main Street, the latter of which is a metaphor for small businesses and individual investors.
Events that happened on or around Wall Street often have impacted not just the investment industry, but the U.S. (and even the global) economy.
Understanding Wall Street
Wall Street and its surrounding southern Manhattan neighborhood—known to locals as the Financial District—remain an important location where a number of financial institutions are based. The financial district is iconic with the bronze Arturo Di Modica statue of the
Charging Bull
. However, the globalization and digitization of finance and investing have led to the rise of many U.S. broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies located elsewhere.
Still, Wall Street
remains a collective name for the
financial markets
, the companies that trade publicly, and the investment community itself. Stock exchanges, investment banking firms, commercial banks, brokerages and broker-dealers, financial services, and
underwriting
firms all symbolize Wall Street.
It's a globally recognized expression that, to some extent, ever refers to the U.S. financial system. Both the NYSE (the largest equities-based exchange in the world) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—arguably the most important regional bank of the
Federal Reserve System
—are based in the Wall Street area.
Wall Street is often shortened to ""the Street,"" which is how the term is frequently used by those in financial circles and the media. For example, when reporting a company's earnings, an analyst might compare a company's revenues to what the Street was expecting. In this case, the analyst is comparing the company's earnings to what financial analysts and investment firms were expecting for that period.
The Importance of Wall Street
Wall Street has had an important impact both economically and culturally.
Economic Importance
The U.S. is the largest economy in the world and New York City is its financial center. As such,
Wall Street's global importance
is unparalleled.
Wall Street consists of some of the largest financial institutions in the world and employs hundreds of thousands of people. It's home to the NYSE and Nasdaq stock exchanges, two of the largest stock exchanges in the world. On these exchanges are listed some of the biggest companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple, and Exxon.
The economic importance of Wall Street extends throughout the American and international economies, as many financial firms do business worldwide, extend loans to a variety of businesses and individuals, and finance large-scale, global projects.
Cultural Importance
Wall Street's cultural influence extends to movies, TV shows, books, and more. Films such as
Wall Street, Margin Call, Boiler Room, Barbarians at the Gate
, and more from previous decades, highlight what the fast-paced life is like on Wall Street. They display an exciting, wealthy, and interesting lifestyle.
Large players on Wall Street have become celebrity icons.
Warren Buffett
, Jamie Dimon, Carl Icahn,
Bernie Madoff
, George Soros, and Larry Fink are names familiar to many. In the imaginations of some in contemporary society, the term Wall Street may evoke a sense of power, the elite, and often, unscrupulous behavior.
During times of economic trouble, such as the
financial crisis of 2008
, Wall Street sometimes becomes a scapegoat and the ills of the economy are blamed on the assumed greed associated with it. No other financial term has become so woven into the global culture.
History of Wall Street
Wall Street got its name
from the wooden wall Dutch colonists built in lower Manhattan in 1653 to defend themselves from the British and Native Americans. The wall was taken down in 1699, but the name stuck.
1
Given its proximity to New York's ports, the Wall Street area became a bustling center of trade in the 1700s. Its origins as a financial center began in 1792, when 24 of the most prominent brokers and merchants in the U.S. signed the
Buttonwood Agreement
. They reportedly gathered on Wall Street, under a buttonwood tree, to do business.
2
1
The agreement outlined the common commission-based form of trading securities. In effect, it was an effort to establish a members-only stock exchange. Some of the first securities traded were war bonds and the stocks of such institutions as the Bank of New York.
3
2
Out of this acorn of an agreement, the oak that became the NYSE grew. In 1817, the Buttonwood brokers renamed themselves The New York Stock and Exchange Board. The organization rented out spaces for trading in several locations until 1865, when it settled on a location of its own, at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets.
1
18 Broad Street
The location of the beating heart of Wall Street, the NYSE, is a 1903 Neo-Classical structure of white marble. An adjacent annex, constructed in 1922, is located at 11 Wall Street, and another subsidiary building is at 20 Broad Street. These three buildings fill the block bounded by Wall Street on the north, Broad Street on the East, Exchange Place on the south, and New Street on the west.
4
As the U.S. grew, several other major exchanges established headquarters in the Wall Street area. These included the
New York Mercantile Exchange
, the New York Board of Trade, the New York Futures Exchange (NYFE), and the
American Stock Exchange
, now known as the NYSE American Options.
To support the exchanges and to be where the action was, banks, brokerage firms, and financiers clustered offices around Wall Street. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the House of Morgan, officially J.P. Morgan & Co.—the forerunner to JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley—was directly opposite the NYSE, at 23 Wall Street.
After World War I, New York City surpassed London to become the world's largest and most significant financial center.
Wall Street vs. Main Street
Wall Street is often compared and contrasted to Main Street. The term ""Main Street"" is used as a metaphor for individual investors, small businesses, employees, and the overall economy. It's derived from the common name for the principal street of a town where most of the local businesses are located.
There is often a perceived conflict between the goals, desires, and motivations of Main Street and Wall Street. Wall Street tends to represent big businesses and financial institutions, while Main Street represents mom-and-pop shops, small companies, and individuals.
Key Events on Wall Street
Events that happened on or around Wall Street often have impacted not just the investment industry, but the global economy and society. Here are some significant moments in Wall Street history.
1889: The Wall Street Journal
On July 8, 1889, Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser launched
The Wall Street Journal
, a four-page afternoon newspaper devoted to objective financial and business news. The three men were reporters, but Dow was also a numbers-cruncher who came up with the idea of creating a benchmark list of companies and their stock prices to represent the entire stock market.
5
Soon, the
Journal
was publishing the
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
index along with hundreds of prices of company stocks, bonds, and futures, and the
average prime rate
for bank loans. For nearly a century, before the advent of real-time internet listings, the
Journal
was the paper of record for the financial markets.
It evolved into a six-day-a-week periodical (that's been online since 1996). The
Journal
is a leading and well-respected
source of financial and business journalism
.
The three founders operated out of offices in lower Manhattan. The fact that they chose to name their new publication
The Wall Street Journal
indicates that Wall Street already was something of an umbrella term for the world of finance and its denizens. Over the years, the paper helped fix this meaning in the public's mind.
1920: The Wall Street Bombing
It was around noon on Sept. 16, 1920. A horse-drawn cart pulled up at 23 Wall Street right in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co. A bustling corner of the neighborhood, it was especially crowded with those headed out for lunch. The cart suddenly exploded. It had been packed with dynamite and filled with sash weights that sailed through the air.
6
At that time, it was the worst domestic bombing in U.S. history. Ultimately, 40 people were killed or died from their injuries, and another 300 were injured. The J.P. Morgan building's interior was gutted. Marks from the shrapnel still are visible on the exterior.
7
No one claimed credit and the case was never solved. But because the explosion occurred in front of the Morgan building, known as a symbol of American capitalism, the bombing was ultimately decided to have been an act of terrorism performed by “Reds”—anarchists and ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wallstreet.asp
Investopedia,W-8BEN: When to Use It and Other Types of W-8 Tax Forms,"Close
What Are W-8 Forms?
W-8 forms are
Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) forms that foreign individuals and businesses must file to verify their country of residence for tax purposes, certifying that they qualify for a lower rate of tax withholding.
Although the W-8 forms are issued by the IRS, they are submitted only to payers or withholding agents, not to the IRS. Failure to submit the form may result in a withholding at the full 30% rate that applies to foreign entities.
1
Key Takeaways
W-8 forms are used by foreign persons or business entities to claim exempt status from certain withholdings.
There are five W-8 forms: W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.
Determining which one to use comes down to whether you’re an individual or an entity, the type of income you receive, and whether you’re an organization that qualifies for special tax treatment.
All W-8 forms are valid for the year in which they are signed and for three full calendar years after that.
Who Can File W-8 Forms?
W-8 forms are
filled out by foreign individuals or entities
that lack U.S. citizenship or residency, but have worked in the U.S. or earned income in the U.S. This usually applies to foreign-domiciled businesses and non-resident aliens.
For example, a non-resident foreigner who earns interest or
dividends
from U.S.-issued
securities
would likely file a W-8BEN, while a foreign nonprofit with operations in the U.S. might need to file form W-8ECI. Former U.S. residents who earn
retirement income
, or who occasionally perform freelance work for U.S. clients, might also have to submit the form to reduce their tax withholdings. A U.S. citizen or resident alien will never have to complete a W-8 form.
Foreign individuals or businesses that earn income in the U.S. must pay a 30% tax on certain income types. The W-8 form will collect information on who the individual or business is, where they're from, and the types of income earned.
1
How to File W-8 Forms
There are five W-8 forms. These forms are requested by the payers or withholding agents and kept on file with them—not filed with the IRS.
The version of the form used is determined by whether or not the filer is an individual or a business and the nature of the income the filer received. The forms are effective for the year in which they are signed and three calendar years afterward. Therefore, a W-8BEN signed on February 24, 2025, would be valid through December 31, 2028.
2
The W-8 series of forms are fairly complex. Though they require basic information such as name, country of origin, and
taxpayer identification number
(TIN), they also ask for the contacts from which the filer is receiving the reported income. A professional is often consulted to assist in completing them.
Important
W-9 forms
are also IRS forms used to provide or confirm a person's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN). The W-9 forms are only required for U.S. citizens or resident aliens, or U.S. entities.
3
Types of W-8 Forms
The following are the five types of W-8 forms and the circumstances where they should be used.
Form W-8BEN
Form W-8BEN (""Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting"") must be submitted by foreign persons who receive certain types of income in the United States. The form, sometimes referred to as a ""certificate of foreign status,"" establishes that the individual is both
a foreign person and the owner of the business
in question.
4
Foreign individuals are ordinarily subject to a tax rate of 30% on specific types of income and
capital gains they receive
from U.S. payers, including:
2
Interest
Dividends
Rents
Royalties
Premiums
Annuities
Compensation for services rendered
The form also helps you claim a reduction or an exemption from the U.S. tax withholding if you reside in a country with which the United States has an income
tax treaty
and the income you received is subject to that treaty.
Foreign persons must provide Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer if they are the beneficial owner of the income subject to the tax withholding. You must submit the form regardless of whether you are claiming a reduced withholding.
5
Individuals must submit the form to the payer or withholding agent prior to receiving income or credits from them. Failure to submit a Form W-8BEN could result in paying either the full 30% rate or the backup withholding rate under section 3406.
5
Form W-8BEN
Fast Fact
Form W-8BEN is used by foreign individuals who receive nonbusiness income in the U.S., whereas W-8BEN-E is used by foreign entities who receive this type of income.
6
Form W-8BEN-E
Form W-8BEN-E is also titled ""Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting,"" but it is filed by foreign entities, not individuals.
7
As with foreign persons who receive certain types of income, the money generated by foreign businesses is typically withheld at a 30% rate by the payer or withholding agent in the United States. However, the form allows the foreign business to claim a reduction in taxes if its country of residence has a tax treaty with the United States.
8
Non-U.S. businesses must provide the Form W-8BEN-E for the same sources of income that would require an individual to file a Form W-8BEN. Foreign entities that do not provide an accurate W-8BEN-E when required to do so will typically have to pay the full 30% tax rate.
8
Form W-8BEN-E
Form W-8ECI
Form W-8ECI is the ""Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption that Income Is Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States."" It is filed by foreign individuals who engage in a trade or business in the United States and receive income from U.S. sources.
9
These proceeds are generally considered ""effectively connected income"" (ECI) whether or not there is a connection between the income and the trade or business being conducted in the United States in a particular year.
10
Crucially, ECI is not subject to the same 30% withholding that applies to interest, rents, and other nonbusiness income. Instead, after subtracting applicable deductions, it is taxed at the graduated rate that U.S. citizens and
resident aliens
pay. If your work is covered by a U.S. treaty, it would be taxed at the lowest rate under that treaty.
11
In most cases, you must have engaged in trade or business activities in the United States sometime during the tax year to be able to categorize income as ECI. That would be the case if, for example, a foreign individual performed personal services in the United States during the year. In addition, money made by a foreigner through investments in a partnership that conducts trade or business in the U.S. would also be treated as ECI.
However, foreigners whose sole U.S. income is based on the trading of securities or commodities through a U.S.-based broker are not considered to be engaged in a trade or business with the United States. Therefore, they would not be subject to ECI tax treatment.
10
Form W-8ECI
Form W-8EXP
Form W-8EXP is the ""Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting"" and is used by certain payees in order to claim a reduction of—or exclusion from—tax withholding. These include foreign governments, foundations, and
tax-exempt
organizations, as well as governments of a U.S. possession or foreign central banks of issue.
12
13
In order to receive a reduction or an exemption from tax withholding, the entity must be eligible under IRS code 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Should none of those exemptions apply, the entity must file a W-8BEN or W-8ECI (if it received ""effectively connected income"").
12
As with other W-8 forms, Form W-8EXP must be sent to the payer or withholding agent before income is paid to you. Not doing so could lead to a tax withholding at the 30% rate, a backup withholding rate, or the ECI tax rate.
12
Form W-8EXP
Form W-8IMY
Form W-8IMY is the ""Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting."" The purpose of the form is to certify that a person or business received withholdable payments on behalf of a foreigner or as a flow-through entity. The form is intended for intermediaries and should not be used by beneficial owners in a business.
14
15
Examples of entities who must file a W-8IMY include:
14
Foreign persons who are certifying that they are a qualified intermediary (QI) that is not acting for its own account and will provide a withholding statement required under chapters three and four of the IRS Code
U.S. branches that are serving in the role of an intermediary and wish either to certify their treatment as a U.S. person under tax law or document the receipt of payments for which they will furnish a withholding statement
Flow-through entities who wish to claim tax benefits under a treaty or certify that they will provide a withholding statement, as required
A complete list of persons or entities required to file the form is in the IRS Instructions for Form W-8IMY. Copies of withholding statements and other documentary evidence should be included with the form when it’s submitted.
14
Form W-8IMY
What Is a W-8BEN?
Form W-8BEN is submitted by foreign individuals who receive income in the U.S. The form establishes that the person is a foreign individual and owner of a business. The W-8BEN is referred to as the certificate of foreign status.
16
Who Needs to Fill Out Form W-8BEN?
Form W-8BEN is used by foreign individuals who receive income from sources in the U.S. Only non-U.S. persons file Form W-8BEN, not U.S. persons.
16
How Do I Get My W-8BEN?
Form W-8BEN is sent by the company making payments to the individual. The form should be returned to the company or entity that sent the form W-8BEN, not to the IRS. It's also not meant to be filed with a tax return. Typically, the form should be submitted bef",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w8form.asp

An oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of firms have significant control over market prices and output, often leading to limited competition and potential collusion among the firms.
What Is an Oligopoly?
An oligopoly is a type of
market
structure in which a small number of firms control the market. Where oligopolies exists, producers can indirectly or directly restrict output or prices to achieve higher returns. A key characteristic of an oligopoly is that no one firm can keep the others from having significant influence over the market. An oligopoly differs from a monopoly, in which one firm dominates a market.
Key Takeaways
An oligopoly is a market structure wherein a small number of producers work to restrict output or fix prices so they can achieve above-normal market returns.
Economic, legal, and technological factors can contribute to the formation and maintenance, or dissolution, of oligopolies.
The major difficulty that oligopolies face is the prisoner's dilemma that each member faces, which encourages each member to cheat.
Government policy can discourage or encourage oligopolistic behavior, and firms in mixed economies often seek government blessing for ways to limit competition.

Understanding Oligopolies
Market structures come in different forms and sizes. The term is used to describe the distinctions between industries, which are made up of different companies that sell their products and services. Most market structures aim for
perfect competition
, which is a theoretical construct that doesn't actually exist.
These market structures are made up of a small number of companies within an industry that controls the market. Firms in an oligopoly
set prices
, whether collectively—in a
cartel
—or under the leadership of one firm, rather than
taking prices
from the market. Profit margins are thus higher than they would be in a more competitive market.
Some of the
barriers to entry
(that prevent new players from entering the market) in an oligopoly include
economies of scale
, regulatory barriers, accessing supply and distribution channels, capital requirements, and brand loyalty.
Oligopolies in history include steel manufacturers, oil companies, railroads, tire manufacturing, grocery store chains, and wireless carriers. The economic and legal concern is that an oligopoly can block new entrants, slow innovation, and increase prices, all of which harm consumers.

Special Considerations
Governments sometimes respond to oligopolies with laws against price-
fixing
and collusion. Yet, a cartel can price fix if they operate beyond the reach or with the blessing of governments. Oligopolies that exist in
mixed economies
often seek out and lobby for favorable government policy to operate under the regulation or even direct supervision of government agencies.
The main problem that firms in an oligopoly face is that each firm has an incentive to cheat. if all firms in the oligopoly agree to jointly restrict supply and keep prices high, then each firm stands to capture substantial business from the others by breaking the agreement and undercutting the others. Such competition can be waged through prices, or through simply the individual company expanding its own output brought to market.
Important
Companies in an oligopoly benefit from price-fixing, setting prices collectively, or under the direction of one firm in the bunch, rather than relying on free-market forces to do so.
Oligopoly Characteristics
Oligopolies are considered stable. One of the main reasons why they are is because participating firms need to see the benefits of collaboration over the costs of economic competition, then agree to not compete and instead agree on the benefits of cooperation.
The firms sometimes find creative ways to avoid the appearance of
price-fixing
, such as using phases of the moon. Price-fixing is the act of setting prices, rather than letting them be determined by the free-market forces. Another approach is for firms to follow a recognized
price leader
so that when the leader raises prices,
the others will follow
.
The conditions that enable oligopolies to exist include high entry costs in
capital expenditures
, legal privilege (license to use wireless spectrum or land for railroads), and a platform that gains value with more customers, such as social media.
The global tech and trade transformation has changed some of these conditions. For instance, offshore production and the rise of mini-mills have affected the steel industry. In the office software application space, Microsoft (
MSFT
) was targeted by Google Docs, which Google funded using cash from its web search business.
Oligopolies and Game Theory
Game theorists have developed models for these scenarios, which form a sort of
prisoner's dilemma
. When costs and benefits are balanced so that no firm wants to break from the group, it is considered the
Nash equilibrium
state for oligopolies. This can be achieved by contractual or market conditions, legal restrictions, or strategic relationships between members of the oligopoly that enable the punishment of cheaters.
Maintaining an oligopoly and coordinating action among buyers and sellers in general on the market involves shaping the payoffs to various prisoner's dilemmas and related coordination games that repeat over time.
As a result, many of the same institutional factors that facilitate the development of market economies by reducing prisoner's dilemma problems among market participants, such as secure enforcement of contracts, cultural conditions of high trust and reciprocity, and laissez-faire economic policy, might also potentially help encourage and sustain oligopolies.
Advantages and Disadvantages of an Oligopoly
Advantages
One of the main benefits of having an oligopoly is that competition is very limited. That's because there are very few players in the market. Since there are few competitors, an oligopoly allows those who participate to net a higher amount of
profits
.
Disadvantages
Oligopolies come with higher barriers to entry for new participants. This means that it can be difficult to enter the market because of the high costs associated with doing business, the regulatory environment, and the problems that arise when it comes to accessing supply and
distribution channels
.
Because of the lack of competition, there may be very little incentive to innovate product and service offerings. With no diversity in offerings, consumers remain loyal to what they know best.
Pros
Limited competition
Higher profits for companies
Greater consumer demand
Cons
High barriers to entry for new participants
Lack of innovation
Very little choice for consumers
Example of an Oligopoly
There are many examples of oligopolies in the market. But one of the major examples of a global oligopoly is the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
. The organization was founded in Baghdad in 1960 with five countries but expanded to 13 oil-producing countries in 1975.
1
One of the main reasons why OPEC is considered an oligopoly is because it has no overarching authority. Every member nation within the group also has a substantial portion of the group's market share. These countries also have a great deal of power together (not separately) when it comes to
supply and demand
issues and pricing. So when the group lowers its supply as demand drops, prices rise. The opposite is true when demand rises.
What Are Some Negative Effects of an Oligopoly?
An oligopoly is when a few companies exert significant control over a given market. Together, these companies may control prices by colluding with each other, ultimately providing uncompetitive prices in the market. Among other detrimental effects of an oligopoly include limiting new entrants in the market and decreased innovation. Oligopolies have been found in the oil industry, railroad companies, wireless carriers, and big tech.
What Is an Example of a Current Oligopoly?
One measure that shows if an oligopoly is present is the concentration ratio, which calculates the size of companies in comparison to their industry. Instances where a high concentration ratio is present include mass media. In the U.S., for example, the sector is dominated by",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp
Investopedia,"Collateral: Definition, Types, and Examples","Close
Definition
Collateral in the financial world is a valuable asset that a borrower offers to a lender as security for a loan.
What Is Collateral?
Collateral is a valuable asset that a borrower pledges as security for a loan, serving thus as a guarantee for the lender.
For example, when a homebuyer gets a mortgage, the home serves as the collateral for the loan. For a car loan, the vehicle is the collateral. A business that obtains financing from a bank may pledge valuable equipment or real estate owned by the business as collateral for the loan. In the event of a default, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup the loss.
Other nonspecific personal loans can be collateralized by other assets. For instance, a secured credit card may be secured by a cash deposit for the same amount as the credit limit—$500 for a $500 credit limit.
Key Takeaways
Collateral reduces the risk for lenders.
If a borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup its losses.
Mortgages and car loans are two types of collateralized loans.
Other personal assets, such as a savings or investment account, can be used to secure a collateralized personal loan.
How Collateral Works
Before a lender issues you a loan, it wants to know that you have the ability to repay it. That's why many of them require some form of security. This security is called collateral, which minimizes the
risk
for lenders by ensuring that the borrower keeps up with their financial
obligation
. The borrower has a compelling reason to repay the loan on time because if they default, they stand to lose their home or other assets pledged as collateral.
The best loans secured by collateral are typically available at substantially lower interest rates than unsecured loans. A lender's claim to a borrower's collateral is called a lien—a legal right or claim against an asset to satisfy a debt.
In the event that the borrower does default, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it, applying the money it gets to the unpaid portion of the loan. The lender can choose to pursue legal action against the borrower to recoup any remaining balance.
Types of Collateral
The nature of the collateral is often predetermined by the
loan type
. When you take out a mortgage, your home becomes the collateral. If you take out a car loan, then the car is the collateral for the loan. The types of collateral that lenders commonly accept include cars—only if they are paid off in full—bank savings deposits, and investment accounts.
Retirement
accounts are not usually accepted as collateral.
You also may use future paychecks as collateral for very short-term loans, and not just from
payday lenders
. Traditional banks offer such loans, usually for terms no longer than a couple of weeks. These short-term loans are an option in a genuine emergency, but even then, you should read the
fine print
carefully and compare rates.
Collateralized Personal Loans
Another type of borrowing is the collateralized personal loan, in which the borrower offers an item of value as
security for a loan
. The value of the collateral must meet or exceed the amount being loaned.
Lenders will typically lend only a
percentage of the collateral's value
, not 100% of its value. If you are considering a collateralized personal loan, your best choice for a lender is probably a financial institution that you already do business with, especially if your collateral is your savings account. If you already have a relationship with the bank, that bank would be more inclined to approve the loan, and you are more apt to get a decent rate for it.
Important
Consider using your current financial institution if you're considering a collateralized personal loan, but shop around with other lenders for the best rates.
Examples of Collateral Loans
Residential Mortgages
A mortgage is a loan in which the house is the collateral. If the homeowner stops paying the mortgage for at least 120 days, the loan servicer can begin legal proceedings, which can lead to the lender eventually taking possession of the house through
foreclosure
.
1
Once the property is transferred to the lender, it can be sold to repay the remaining principal on the loan.
Home Equity Loans
A home may also function as collateral on a second mortgage for a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). In this case, the amount of the loan will not exceed the available equity. For example, if a home is valued at $200,000, and $125,000 remains on the primary mortgage, a second mortgage or HELOC will be available only for as much as $75,000.
Margin Trading
Collateralized loans are also a factor in margin trading. An investor borrows money from a broker to buy shares, using the balance in the investor's brokerage account as collateral.
The loan increases the number of shares the investor can buy, thus multiplying the potential gains if the shares increase in value. But the risks are also multiplied. If the shares decrease in value, the broker demands payment of the difference. In that case, the account serves as collateral if the borrower fails to cover the loss.
Is Collateral Property?
Collateral guarantees a loan, so it needs to be an item of value. For example, it can be a piece of property, such as a car or a home, or even cash that the lender can seize if the borrower does not pay.
What Loans Do not Use an Asset as Collateral?
If you don't have any collateral necessary to secure a certain type of loan, you may want to consider looking into
unsecured
loans, such as a personal loan or credit card (both of which don't use an asset as collateral), as an alternative.
Do I Get Back My Collateral?
If you have any assets being used as collateral on a loan and don't miss any payments, you won't lose your collateral. However, if you fail to make payments on time and ultimately default on your loan, the collateral can then be seized and sold, with the profits being used to pay off the remainder of the loan.
The Bottom Line
You risk losing your collateral if you fail to pay back your debt. So to ensure you keep your car, home, or any other valuable asset being used as collateral on a loan, always make your payments on time to minimize any possibility of defaulting on your debt.

Investopedia,General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Meaning and Rules,"Close
What Is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in and outside of the
European Union
(EU).
Approved in 2016 and put into effect in 2018, the GDPR is the toughest security and privacy law in the world. It aims to give consumers control over their own personal data by holding companies responsible for the way they handle and treat this information.
1
The regulation applies regardless of where websites are based, which means it must be heeded by all sites that attract European visitors, even if they don't specifically market goods or services to EU residents.
Key Takeaways
The General Data Protection Regulation is a law that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals.
The law was approved in 2016 but didn't go into effect until May 2018.
The GDPR provides consumers with more control over how their personal data is handled and disseminated by companies.
Companies must inform consumers about what they do with consumer data and every time that data is breached.
GDPR rules apply to any website regardless of where they are based.
Understanding the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law that was approved by the European Union in April 2016 and went into effect on May 25, 2018.
2
It replaced an earlier law, the Data Protection Directive, and was set up to regulate the way
companies
process and use the personal data they collect from consumers online. It also has rules in the way that information is moved, whether that's partly or entirely through automated means.
The law makes it difficult for companies to mislead consumers with confusing or vague language when they visit their websites. It also ensures:
Website visitors are notified of the data collected.
Visitors explicitly consent to that information-gathering by clicking on a button or some other action.
Sites notify visitors in a timely way if any of their personal data held by the site is ever breached.
There is a mandated assessment of the site's data security.
Whether a dedicated
data protection officer
(DPO) needs to be hired or an existing staffer can carry out this function.
3
4
5
These requirements may be more stringent than those required in the jurisdiction in which the site is located.
Information on how to contact the DPO and other relevant staffers must be accessible so that visitors may exercise their EU data rights, which also includes the ability to have their presence on the site erased, among other measures. The site must also add staff and other resources to be capable of carrying out such requests.
6
Note
The requirement of an ""Agree"" button largely explains the ubiquitous presence of disclosures that sites collect cookies, which are small files that hold personal information such as site settings and preferences.
Special Considerations
As further protection for consumers, the GDPR also calls for any
personally identifiable information
(PII) that sites collect to be either anonymized (rendered anonymous) or pseudonymized with the consumer's identity replaced with a pseudonym.
7
This allows firms to do more extensive data analysis, such as assessing the average debt ratios of their customers in a particular region—a calculation that might otherwise be beyond the original purposes of data collected for assessing creditworthiness for a loan.
The regulation applies to all 27 members of the EU and the
European Economic Area
(EEA), regardless of where websites and residents are based. As such, it must be heeded by all sites that attract European visitors, even if they don't specifically market goods or services to EU residents.
So the regulation applies to the data of an EU citizen even if it is housed in the U.S. Similarly, a U.S. citizen who resides in the EU is covered whenever they visit sites based in the union.
Important
The GDPR affects data beyond that collected from customers. Most notably, perhaps, the regulation applies to the human resources records of employees.
2
Criticism of the GDPR
The GDPR has attracted criticism in some quarters. Some say that the requirement to appoint DPOs, or simply to assess the need for them imposes an undue administrative burden on certain companies. Some complain that the guidelines are too vague on how best to deal with employee data.
In addition, data cannot be transferred to another country outside the EU, unless the receiving company guarantees the same degree of protection as the EU requires. This has led to complaints about costly disruption to
business practices
.
There's a further concern that the costs associated with GDPR will increase over time, in part because of the escalating need to educate customers and employees alike about data protection threats and solutions.
There's also skepticism over how feasibly data protection agencies across the EU and beyond can align their enforcement and interpretation of the regulations, and so assure a level playing field as the GDPR goes into fuller effect.
How Do Companies Become Compliant Under the General Data Protection Regulation?
There are several ways for companies to become GDPR-compliant. Some of the key steps include auditing personal data and keeping a record of all the data they collect and process. Companies should also be sure to update privacy notices to all website visitors and fix any errors they find in their databases.
Who Is Covered Under the General Data Protection Regulation?
In theory, any individual who visits sites that are based in the European Union is protected. This includes anyone within the union itself and beyond its borders. The regulation also applies to a citizen of the EU whose data exists outside the union. And if you're a citizen of another country who lives in the EU, your data is also protected under the law.
When Did the GDPR Come Into Effect?
The GDPR was approved in April 2016. However, it took two years for the framework to be established. As such, the regulation went into full effect on May 25, 2018.
2
The Bottom Line
Businesses collect personal data and they have often sold that information—sometimes without the consent of their consumers. But laws have been put into place in parts of the world to help protect individuals.
Rules under the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in the European Union in 2018. Under the law, companies must protect consumer data and inform them how their information is used. It has a broad reach, extending beyond the
borders of the EU

Investopedia,"Kiting Definition, How It Works With Checks and Securities","Close
What Is Kiting?
Kiting is the fraudulent use of a financial instrument to obtain additional credit that is not authorized. Kiting encompasses two main types of fraud:
Issuing or altering a check or bank draft, for which there are
insufficient funds
.
Misrepresenting the value of a
financial instrument
for the purpose of extending credit obligations or increasing financial
leverage
.
Key Takeaways
Kiting involves the illegal use of financial instruments to fraudulently obtain additional credit.
Securities firms ""kite"" if they fail to follow SEC rules around obtaining securities in a timely way.
Check kiting targets banks or retailers through a series of bad checks, sometimes drawn on multiple accounts.
Check Kiting Involving Banks
Carried out within the banking system, kiting typically involves passing a series of checks at two or more banking institutions, using accounts that have insufficient funds. Relying on the
float time
required for a check deposited at one bank to clear at another, the kiter typically writes a check at the first bank against an account at the other.
Before that check clears, they then withdraw the funds from the second bank account and deposit the funds back into the first. The process may then be repeated in the opposite order, sometimes repeatedly. The net result is a series of fraudulent withdrawals that rely on being a step ahead of the fraudulent check on which they are based having cleared.
Reduced times for checks to clear has helped reduce the incidence of check kiting involving banks, as have such practices as banks placing holds on deposited funds and charging for returned checks.
Retail Kiting
A variant of check kiting is known as ""retail kiting."" This relies on cashing a bad check (number one) at a retailer to purchase an item. Then, before that check has cleared, the kiter writes another check (number two), which may include (or entirely comprise) a cashback payment. While
cashback
is now most often associated with debit cards, some retailers still offer this convenience with checks.
The cash from check number two is then deposited into the account, to allow check number one to clear. The fraud is then repeated in order to cover check number two and may be sustained in order to stay ahead of the float and fraudulently obtain a series of items and cash withdrawals.
Kiting With Securities
Kiting that involves misrepresenting securities generally occurs when securities firms flout
SEC
regulations regarding the timely delivery of buy-and-sell transactions, which must be completed within a three-day settlement period.
1
If a firm fails to receive the securities within that timeframe, it is required to purchase the shortage on the
open market
and charge the delinquent firm for any associated fees.
The delinquent firm is considered to be practicing the fraudulent act of kiting if it fails to purchase the securities on the open market and maintains a
short position
, delays delivery, or takes part in transactions contrary to the proper settlement of trades.

Definition
An annual return measures the growth of an investment, on average, each year during a specific period. It is a commonly used method for comparing the performance of liquid investments.
What Is an Annual Return?
An annual return is the
return
that an investment provides over time. It's expressed as a time-weighted annual percentage. Sources of returns can include dividends, returns of capital, and capital appreciation. The rate of annual return is measured against the initial amount of the investment and it represents a
geometric mean
rather than a simple arithmetic mean.
Key Takeaways
An annual or annualized return is a measure of how much an investment has increased on average each year during a specific period.
The annual return is calculated as a geometric average to show what the annual return compounded would look like.
It can be more useful than a simple return when you want to see how an investment has performed over time or to compare two investments.
An annual return can be determined for a variety of assets including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, and certain derivatives.

How an Annual Return Works
An annual return can be calculated for various assets including stocks, bonds, funds, commodities, and some types of
derivatives
. It's the standard method for comparing the performance of investments with
liquidity
. This process is a preferred method, considered to be more accurate than a simple return because it includes adjustments for compounding interest. Different asset classes tend to have different strata of
annual returns
.
1
Annual Returns on Stocks
The annual return expresses a stock’s increase in value over a designated period. Information regarding the current price of the stock and the price at which it was purchased is required to calculate it. The purchase price must be adjusted accordingly if any splits have occurred. The simple return percentage is calculated first when the prices are determined with that figure ultimately being annualized.
2
The simple return is the current price minus the purchase price divided by the purchase price.

Consider an investor who purchases a stock for $20 on Jan. 1, 2024. The investor then sells the stock on Jan. 1, 2029, for $35 and realizes a $15 profit. The investor also receives a total of $2 in dividends over the five-year holding period. The investor's total return over five years would be $17, or (17/20) 85% of the initial investment.
The annual return required to achieve 85% over five years follows the formula for the compound annual growth rate (CAGR):

The annualized return varies from the typical average and shows the real gain or loss on an investment as well as the difficulty in recouping losses. Losing 50% on an initial investment requires a 100% gain the next year to make up the difference. Annualized returns help even out investment results for better comparison because of the sizable difference in gains and losses that can occur.
Important
Annual return statistics are commonly quoted in promotional materials for mutual funds,
ETFs
, and other individual securities.
Annual Returns on a 401(k)
The calculation differs when you're determining the
annual return
of a
401(k)
during a specific year. The total return must first be calculated. The starting value for the period being examined is needed along with the final value. Any contributions to the account during the period in question must be subtracted from the final value before performing the calculations.
The adjusted final value is divided by the starting balance after the adjusted final value is determined. Subtract 1 from the result and multiply that amount by 100 to determine the percentage of total return.
Other Return Measures
Other common return measures may be an extension of the basic return method. They include adjusting for discrete or continuous periods, which is helpful for more accurate compounding calculations over longer periods and in certain financial market applications.
Asset managers commonly use
money-weighted
and
time-weighted rates
of return to measure performance or the rate of return on an investment portfolio. Money-weighted rates of return focus on cash flows but the time-weighted rate of return looks at the compound rate of growth of the portfolio.
What Is the Modified Dietz Formula?
The Modified Dietz formula is a method of annual return calculation that takes your cash flow into account. It compounds returns over each period.

Are There Other Ways to Calculate Annual Return?
You can calculate your rate of return by month and then multiply the result by 12 to get your annual rate of return. Numerous calculators are
available online
to do the math for you.

(ROI) by subtracting the initial cost of your investment from its final value. Divide the result by the overall cost of the investment, adding in fees, commissions, and mark-ups. Multiply this result by 100 to get a percentage.
The Bottom Line
Calculating annual return tells you how much you're earning or losing on a particular investment from year to year. It can be a critical component when you're placing your money somewhere to see it grow, such as in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. It compares performance with liquidity.
Speak with a professional if you're not sure you're calculating correctly so you can plan your next move.

A 457 plan helps reduce an employee's annual income tax with pre-tax retirement savings.
What Is a 457 Plan?
A 457 plan is a
tax-advantaged
retirement savings plan for many state, local government, and some nonprofit organization employees. The 457(b) is the most common type. Like a
401(k) plan
in the private sector, the 457(b) allows employees to
save pre-tax earnings in an account
, reducing their annual income taxes while postponing the taxes due until the money is withdrawn during retirement.
A
Roth version
of the 457(b) plan allows after-tax contributions. The 457(f) plan is a supplemental plan offered only to highly compensated executives in tax-exempt organizations.
1
Key Takeaways
The 457(b) is an IRS-sanctioned, tax-advantaged employee retirement plan.
The plan is offered only to public service employees and employees at tax-exempt organizations.
The interest and earnings in the account are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Contribution Limits
Employees commonly choose
mutual funds
and
annuities
with a 457 and can contribute up to 100% of their salary up to the IRS annual limit. For 2025, the 457(b) contribution limit is expected to rise to $23,500, up from $23,000 in 2024.
2
3
There is a catch-up limit of $7,500 as additional savings for those aged 50 and older. For example, if an employer permits
catch-up contributions
, eligible workers may save $7,500 more a year, making their maximum contribution limit $31,000 ($23,500 + $7,500) in 2025.
3
Section 109 of the 2022 SECURE 2.0 Act permits 457 plans to optionally offer higher catch-up contributions in 2025 for participants ages 60 to 63 before the end of the tax year. The maximum catch-up limit is the greater of $10,000 or 150% of the regular catch-up limit.
4
Additionally, a 457 plan's ""double limit"" provision allows participants to contribute up to twice the annual limit for three years before the employee's normal retirement age.

The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
Important
The
SECURE 2.0 Act
raised the age for taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) to 73. Those who reached age 72 in 2023 must take their first RMD on April 1, 2025.
6
Advantages and Disadvantages
A traditional 457 deducts contributions pretax, lowering workers' annual taxes. All interest and earnings generated annually remain untaxed until the funds are withdrawn.
7
Unlike other tax-advantaged retirement plans, there's no penalty for early withdrawals with a 457. Those who retire early or resign can withdraw funds without incurring a 10% penalty from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
.
8
9
A 457 account holder can take a penalty-free withdrawal without changing jobs, like a 401(k) account holder under ""unforeseeable emergencies.""
10
However, early withdrawals from a 457 are subject to a 10% penalty if the account holder rolls the funds over from a 457 to any other tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401(k).
11
One downside of a 457 plan is employers do not commonly match employee contributions. If they do, the employer contribution counts toward the maximum contribution limit.
12
This is not the case for 401(k) plans.
13
Pros
Looser rules for early withdrawals.
Early distributions allowed for participants who leave a job.
No taxes are due until money is withdrawn.
Cons
Employer contributions count toward contribution limits.
Employer contributions subject to a vesting schedule.
Limited investment choices compared to private sector plans.
457(b) vs. 403(b)
The 403(b) plan, like the 457(b), is primarily available to public service employees, such as public school teachers.
The 403(b)
began in the 1950s when it exclusively offered an
annuity
to participants.
14
Participants can still create an annuity or choose to invest in mutual funds.
7
As of 2024, the 403(b) closely resembles the private sector's 401(k) plan. The annual contribution limits are identical to those of 457(b) and 401(k) plans.
15
What Is the Difference Between a 457(b) Plan and a 457(f) Plan?
The 457(b) plan is a version of the 401(k) plan designed for public and nonprofit workers. It helps employees save for retirement while deferring the tax bill until they retire and withdraw the money.
1
The 457(f) plan is also known as a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
. It is a retirement savings plan for only the highest-paid executives in the tax-exempt sector. They are mostly employed in hospitals, universities, and credit unions. A 457(f) supplements a 457(b).
16
17
9
Is a 457(b) Plan Better Than a 401(k) Plan?
A 457(b) plan compares to a 401(k) plan. Both allow workers to lower taxable income and invest in retirement savings.
12
However, contributions made to a 457(b) may not be matched by the employer like a 401(k).
How and When Can Employees Withdraw from a 457(b) Account?
Employees can withdraw without paying a tax penalty for any ""unforeseeable emergency.""
10
Retirees must take the
required minimum distribution (RMD)
determined by the IRS. An RMD is a minimum amount that must be withdrawn from certain retirement plans, like a 457(b), each year once an individual reaches a certain age.
18
19
20
The Bottom Line
A 457(b) plan is similar to a 401(k) but applies to employees of government agencies, public services, and nonprofit organizations such as hospitals, churches, and charitable organizations. The traditional version of this tax-advantaged retirement savings plan uses pretax contributions, whereas the Roth version uses post-tax contributions.

Capital is a broad term for the money or other assets that are used by a business to generate returns.
What Is Capital?
Capital is a broad term that can describe anything that confers value or benefit to its owners, such as a factory and its machinery, intellectual property like patents, or the
financial assets
of a business or an individual.
While money itself may be construed as capital, capital is more often associated with cash that is being put to work for productive or investment purposes. In general, capital is a critical component of running a business from day to day and financing its future growth.
Business capital may derive from the operations of the business or be raised from debt or equity financing. When budgeting, businesses of all kinds typically focus on three types of capital: working capital, equity capital, and debt capital. A business in the financial industry identifies trading capital as a fourth component.
Learn more about the types, sources, and structures of capital.
Key Takeaways
The capital of a business is the money it has available to pay for its day-to-day operations and to fund its future growth.
The four major types of capital include working capital, debt, equity, and trading capital; trading capital is used by brokerages and other financial institutions.
Any debt capital is offset by a debt liability on the balance sheet.
The capital structure of a company determines what mix of these types of capital it uses to fund its business.
Economists look at the capital of a family, a business, or an entire economy to evaluate how efficiently it is using its resources.
Investopedia / Matthew Collins
Understanding Capital
From the economist's perspective, capital is key to the functioning of any unit, whether that unit is a family, a small business, a large corporation, or an entire economy.

Capital assets can be found on either the current or long-term portion of the
balance sheet
. These assets may include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as well as manufacturing equipment, production facilities, and storage facilities.
Fast Fact
In the broadest sense, capital can be a measurement of wealth and a resource for increasing wealth. Individuals hold capital and capital assets as part of their net worth. Companies have capital structures that define the mix of debt capital, equity capital, and working capital for daily expenditures that they use.
Capital is typically cash or
liquid assets
being held or obtained for expenditures. In a broader sense, the term may be expanded to include all of a company’s assets that have monetary value, such as its equipment, real estate, and inventory. But when it comes to budgeting, capital is cash flow.
In general, capital can be a measurement of wealth and also a resource that provides for increasing wealth through direct investment or capital project investments. Individuals hold capital and capital assets as part of their net worth. Companies have capital structures that include debt capital, equity capital, and working capital for daily expenditures.
How individuals and companies finance their working capital and invest their obtained capital is critical for their prosperity.
How Capital Is Used
Capital is used by companies to pay for the ongoing production of goods and services to create profit. Companies use their capital to invest in all kinds of things to create value. Labor and building expansions are two common areas of capital allocation. By investing capital, a business or individual seeks to earn a higher return than the capital's costs.
At the national and global levels, financial capital is analyzed by economists to understand how it is influencing economic growth. Economists monitor several metrics of capital including personal income and personal consumption from the
Department of Commerce
’s personal income and outlays reports. Capital investment also can be found in the quarterly gross domestic product (
GDP
) report.
Typically, business capital and financial capital are judged from the perspective of a company’s capital structure. In the U.S., banks are required to hold a minimum amount of capital as a risk mitigation requirement (sometimes called
economic capital
) as directed by the central banks and banking regulations.
1
Other private companies are responsible for assessing their capital thresholds, capital assets, and capital needs for corporate investment. Most of the financial capital analysis for businesses is done by closely analyzing the balance sheet.
Business Capital Structure
A company’s balance sheet provides for metric analysis of a capital structure, which is split among assets, liabilities, and equity. The mix defines the structure.
Debt financing represents a cash capital asset that must be repaid over time through scheduled liabilities. Equity financing, meaning the sale of stock shares, provides cash capital that is also reported in the equity portion of the balance sheet. Debt capital typically comes with lower rates of return and strict provisions for repayment.
Some of the key metrics for analyzing business capital are weighted average cost of capital, debt to equity, debt to capital, and
return on equity
.
Types of Capital
Below are the top four types of capital that businesses focus on.
Debt Capital
A business can acquire capital by borrowing. This is debt capital, and it can be obtained through private or government sources. For established companies, this most often means borrowing from banks and other financial institutions or issuing bonds. For small businesses starting on a shoestring, sources of capital may include friends and family, online lenders,
credit card
companies, and federal loan programs.
Like individuals, businesses must have an active credit history to obtain debt capital. Debt capital requires regular repayment with interest. The interest rates vary depending on the type of capital obtained and the borrower’s credit history.
Individuals quite rightly see debt as a burden, but businesses see it as an opportunity, at least if the debt doesn't get out of hand. It is the only way that most businesses can obtain a large enough lump sum to pay for a major investment in the future. But both businesses and their potential investors need to keep an eye on the
debt to capital ratio
to avoid getting in too deep.
Issuing bonds is a favorite way for corporations to raise debt capital, especially when prevailing interest rates are low, making it cheaper to borrow. In 2020, for example, corporate bond issuance by U.S. companies soared 70% year over year, according to Moody's Analytics.
2
Average corporate bond yields had then hit a multi-year low of about 2.3%.
3
Equity Capital
Equity capital can come in several forms. Typically, distinctions are made between private equity, public equity, and real estate equity.
Private and public equity will usually be structured in the form of shares of stock in the company. The only distinction here is that public equity is raised by listing the company's shares on a stock exchange while private equity is raised among a closed group of investors.
When an individual investor buys shares of stock, they are providing equity capital to a company. The biggest splashes in the world of raising equity capital come, of course, when a company launches an initial public offering (
IPO
).
Working Capital
A company's working capital is its liquid capital assets available for fulfilling daily obligations. It is calculated through the following two assessments:
Current Assets – Current Liabilities
Accounts Receivable + Inventory – Accounts Payable
Working capital measures a company's short-term liquidity. More specifically, it represents its ability to cover its debts,
accounts payable
, and other obligations that are due within one year.
Note that working capital is defined as current assets minus its current liabilities. A company that has more liabilities than assets could soon run short of working capital.
Important
Capital doesn't just refer to money. Capital assets can also include factories, equipment, real estate, intellectual property, and human capital—anything of value that a business uses to generate returns.

Definition
A bond is a fixed-income investment issued by governments or corporations to raise funding.
What Is a Bond?
A bond is a fixed-income investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a specified interest rate for a predetermined period. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond.
Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.
Key Takeaways
A bond is a fixed-income instrument that pays a fixed interest rate or coupon to the holders.
Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa.
Bonds are sold with maturity dates, which are the dates by which the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default.
Investopedia / Ellen Lindner
How Bonds Work
Bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure projects. Corporations often borrow to grow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or hire employees.
Bonds are
fixed-income securities
and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be repaid. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.
The initial price of most bonds is typically set at what is called their par value, or the face value of one bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures.

Fast Fact
Markets allow lenders to buy or sell their bonds to other investors long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date.
Characteristics of Bonds
Face value or Par Value
: The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments.
Coupon Rate
: The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage.
Coupon Dates
: The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments.
Maturity Date
: The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.
Issue Price
:
The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issued at par.
Bond Categories
There are four primary
categories of bonds
sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms.
Corporate Bonds
: Companies issue corporate bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.
Municipal Bonds
: Issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors.
Government Bonds
: Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called “Bills,” bonds issued with one–10 years to maturity are called “notes,” and government bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called “bonds.” The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as ""treasuries.""
Agency Bonds
: Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds.
Bond Prices and Interest Rates
A bond's price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bond’s price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa.
The issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a $1,000 par, 10% annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder $100 each year. If prevailing market interest rates are also 10% at the time this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return $100. However, if interest rates drop to 5%, the investor can only receive $50 from the government bond but would still receive $100 from the
corporate bond
.
Investors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment—in this case, the bond will trade at $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%.
Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15%, then an investor could make $150 from the government bond and would not pay $1,000 to earn just $100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case, to a price of $666.67.
Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)
The
yield-to-maturity
(YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate.
YTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled. YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate.
YTM.
Investopedia
Investors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates. This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes.
How to Invest in Bonds
While there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds. Investors can also take a look at Investopedia's list of the best online stock brokers.

Bond Variations
The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes.
Zero-Coupon Bonds (Z-bonds)
: Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds.
Convertible Bonds
:
Debt instruments
with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price.
Callable Bonds
: Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be “called” back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value.

Total quality management is an ongoing process used by businesses to control manufacturing errors, avoid supply chain glitches, monitor employee training, and improve customer experience.
What Is Total Quality Management (TQM)?
Total quality management (TQM) is the continual process of detecting and reducing or eliminating errors in manufacturing. It streamlines
supply chain management
, improves the customer experience, and ensures that employees are up to speed with training.
Total
quality management
aims to hold all parties involved in the production process accountable for the overall quality of the final product or service.
Key Takeaways
TQM is used to streamline supply chain management, improve customer service, and ensure that employees are properly trained.
The focus is to improve the quality of an organization’s outputs, including goods and services, through the continual improvement of internal practices.
Total quality management aims to hold all parties involved in the production process accountable for the overall quality of the final product or service.
There are often eight guiding principles to TQM that range from focusing on customers to continually improving to adhering to processes.
Katie Kerpel / Investopedia
Understanding Total Quality Management (TQM)
Total quality management is a structured approach to overall organizational management. The focus of the process is to improve the quality of an organization’s outputs, including goods and services, through the continual improvement of internal practices. The standards set as part of the TQM approach can reflect both internal priorities and any industry standards currently in place.
Industry standards can be defined at multiple levels and may include adherence to various laws and regulations governing the operation of a particular business. Industry standards can also include the production of items to an understood norm, even if the norm is not backed by official regulations.
Acceptance sampling
might be used to check the progress toward the TQM goal.
Example of TQM
Perhaps the most famous example of TQM is Toyota’s implementation of the
kanban
system. A
kanban
is a physical signal that creates a chain reaction, resulting in a specific action. Toyota used this idea to implement its just-in-time (JIT) inventory process.
1
The company decided to keep just enough inventory on hand to fill customer orders as they were generated to make its assembly line more efficient. All parts of Toyota’s assembly line are therefore assigned a physical card that has an associated inventory number.
The card is removed and moved up the supply chain right before a part is installed in a car, effectively requesting another of the same part. This allows the company to keep its inventory lean and not overstock unnecessary assets. Effective quality management resulted in better automobiles that could be produced at an affordable price.
History of TQM
TQM’s history often dates back to the early 1900s, when Walter A. Shewhart introduced modern quality control. Shewhart produced a landmark piece of industrial work titled “Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product” in 1931. This exposition is considered one of the founding and basic principles of manufacturing quality control.
2
Further developments in Shewhart’s work introduced new standards in quality management decades later. Joseph M. Juran published a book called “What Is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way” in 1954. The work was based on Juran’s experience of being invited to Japan by Japanese scientists and engineers. Juran later co-authored “Quality Planning and Analysis,” another bestseller in TQM.
3
Another prominent figure in TQM history is W. Edwards Deming. Posted in Japan after World War II, Deming became involved with the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE). His career work included several TQM frameworks (Deming’s 14 Points, Deming’s Seven Deadly Diseases of Management, and The Deming Wheel).

Primary Principles of TQM
TQM is considered a customer-focused process that focuses on consistently improving business
operations management
. It strives to ensure that all associated employees work toward the common goals of improving product or service quality, as well as improving the procedures that are in place for production. Several guiding principles define TQM.
Focus on Customers
Under TQM, your customers define whether your products are high quality. Customer input is highly valued because it allows a company to better understand the needs and requirements in the manufacturing process. Customer surveys may reveal insufficient durability of goods. This input is then fed back into TQM systems to implement better raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes, and
quality control
procedures.
Commitment by Employees
Employees must buy into the processes and system if TQM is going to be successful. This includes clearly communicating across departments and leaders what goals, expectations, needs, and constraints are in place. A company adopting TQM principles must be willing to train employees and give them sufficient resources to complete tasks successfully and on time. TQM also strives to reduce
attrition
and maintain knowledgeable workers.
Improve Continuously
A company should gradually evolve and strive for incremental, small improvements as it learns more about its customers, processes, and competition. This concept of continuous improvement helps a company adapt to changing market expectations. It allows for greater adaptability to different products, markets, customers, or regions. Continuous improvement also drives and widens the
competitive advantage
that a company has built over related companies.
Adherence to Processes
TQM’s systematic approach relies heavily on process flowcharts, TQM diagrams, visual action plans, and documented
workflows
. Every member engaged in the process must be aware and educated on their part of the process to ensure proper steps are taken at the right time of production. These processes are then continually analyzed to better understand deficiencies in the process.
Strategic and Systematic Approach
A company’s processes and procedures should be a direct reflection of the organization’s vision,
mission
, and long-term plan. TQM calls for a system approach to decision-making that requires that a company dedicate itself to integrating quality as its core component and making the appropriate financial investments to make that happen.
Data Utilization
The systematic approach of TQM only works if feedback and input are given to evaluate how the process flow is moving. Management must continually rely on production, turnover, efficiency, and employee metrics to correlate the anticipated outcomes with the actual results.
TQM relies heavily on documentation and planning, and only by utilizing and
analyzing data
can management understand if those plans are being met.
Integrate Systems
One way to utilize data is to integrate systems. TQM strategies believe systems should talk to each other, conveying useful information across departments and making smart decisions.
When goods or inventory are used in one area, another department should have immediate access to that
enterprise resource planning (ERP)
information. TQM strives to allow everyone to be on the same page at the same time by linking data sources and sharing information across systems.
Communication
Data may transfer between departments freely, but there is a human element to coordinating processes and making sure an entire production line is operating efficiently.
Effective communication plays a large part in TQM to motivate employees, educate members along a process, and avoid process errors, whether it is normal day-to-day operations or large organizational changes.
Important
Successful TQM requires a company-wide buy-in of every principle. The benefits of TQM quickly diminish if a company does not receive complete buy-in.
How to Implement TQM
TQM is a unique process. There is not a specific formula for implementing a system that suits every business and each type of industry. But you can create a checklist of issues that might suit your enterprise and proceed with them in chronological order. Some may suit your business, while others will not. Select those that you think will provide an advantage.
Identify your company’s existing culture, its core values, and its systems.
Use this information to create a system that will serve as your master plan.
Establish what your customers and clients want and what they expect from your business. Determine how to best meet these expectations and needs.
Create a team of management and employees to guide and implement your goals, and include these efforts in your daily business management process.
Consistently gather feedback from employees and customers to gauge your progress.
Advantages and Disadvantages of TQM
TQM results in a company making a product for less when it’s implemented correctly. Companies that engage in TQM provide more consistent products that yield stronger customer loyalty when they emphasize quality and minimize waste.

The interest coverage ratio reveals a company’s solvency and ability to pay interest on its debt.
What Is the Interest Coverage Ratio?
The interest coverage ratio is a debt and profitability ratio. It shows how easily a company can pay
interest
on its outstanding
debt
. The ratio divides a company’s
earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
by its interest expense over a specific period.
The interest coverage ratio may be called the
times interest earned (TIE) ratio
. It helps lenders, investors, and creditors determine a company’s riskiness for future borrowing.
Key Takeaways
The interest coverage ratio measures how well a company can pay the interest due on outstanding debt.
The ratio is found by dividing a company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense during a given period.
The interest coverage ratio helps lenders, investors, and creditors determine a company’s riskiness for future borrowing.
A higher ICR suggest a stronger ability to pay interest and a lower risk of default.

Formula and Calculation
Interest Coverage Ratio
=
EBIT
Interest Expense
where:
EBIT
=
Earnings before interest and taxes
\begin{aligned} &\text{Interest Coverage Ratio}=\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{EBIT}=\text{Earnings before interest and taxes} \end{aligned}
​
Interest Coverage Ratio
=
Interest Expense
EBIT
​
where:
EBIT
=
Earnings before interest and taxes
​
The “coverage” represents the number of times a company can successfully
pay its obligations
with its earnings.
A low ratio may signal that the company has high debt expenses with minimal capital. For example, when a company’s interest coverage ratio is 1.5 or lower, it can only cover its obligations a maximum of one and a half times. Its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable in the long run.
Companies need earnings to cover interest payments and survive unforeseeable financial hardships. A company’s ability to meet its interest obligations is an aspect of its
solvency
and a factor in the return for
shareholders
.
Important
When corporate interest rates rise, interest coverage ratios may decline. Rising rates limit profits and hurt a company’s ability to borrow, invest, and hire new employees.
1
Earnings Variations
EBITDA
: Uses
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)
instead of EBIT in calculating the interest coverage ratio. This variation excludes depreciation and amortization. Calculations using EBITDA produce a higher interest coverage ratio than calculations using EBIT.
EBIAT
: Uses
earnings before interest after taxes (EBIAT)
, deducting taxes from the numerator to render a more accurate picture of a company’s ability to pay its interest expenses.

What the Ratio Means for Investors
When a company struggles with its obligations, it may borrow or dip into its cash reserves, a source for
capital asset
investment or required for emergencies. Analyzing interest coverage ratios over time will often give a clearer picture of a company’s position and trajectory.
Looking at a company’s ratios every quarter over many years lets investors know whether the ratio is improving, declining, or stable. Some banks or potential bond buyers may be comfortable with a less desirable ratio in exchange for charging the company a higher interest rate on their debt.
Example
Suppose a company’s earnings for the first quarter are $625,000 with monthly debt payments of $30,000. To calculate the interest coverage ratio, convert the monthly interest payments into quarterly payments by multiplying by three.
The interest coverage ratio is $625,000 / $90,000 ($30,000 × 3) = 6.94. This indicates the company has no
liquidity
issues and can cover almost seven times its obligations.
An interest coverage ratio of 1.5 is low, and lenders may refuse to lend the company more money, as the company’s
risk of default
may be perceived as high. If a company’s ratio is below one, it will likely need to spend some of its
cash reserves
to meet the difference or borrow more.
What Are the Limitations of the Interest Coverage Ratio?
A company’s ratio should be evaluated against others in the same industry or those with similar
business models
and
revenue
numbers. However, companies may isolate or exclude certain types of debt in their interest coverage ratio calculations. As such, when considering a company’s self-published interest coverage ratio, determine if all debts are included.
What Is a Good Interest Coverage Ratio?
A good ratio indicates that a company can service the interest on its debts using its earnings or has shown the ability to maintain revenues at a consistent level. A well-established utility will likely have consistent production and revenue due to government regulation. Even if it has a relatively low ratio, it may reliably cover its interest payments. Other industries, such as manufacturing, are much more volatile and may
often have a minimum acceptable interest coverage ratio
of three or higher.
What Does an Interest Coverage Ratio of Less than One Indicate?
A poor interest coverage ratio, such as below one, means the company’s current earnings are insufficient to service its outstanding debt. The chances of a company being able to continue to meet its
interest expenses
on an ongoing basis are doubtful.
The Bottom Line
The interest coverage ratio, or times interest earned (TIE) ratio, shows how well a company can pay the interest on its debts. It is calculated by dividing EBIT, EBITDA, or EBIAT by a period’s interest expense. Interest coverage ratios vary across industries.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the U.S. government agency responsible for enforcing federal tax laws, collecting taxes, and conducting audits to ensure taxpayer compliance.
What Is the IRS?
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the division of the U.S. Treasury Department tasked with enforcing the
Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
, administering federal tax laws, and collecting federal taxes from U.S. individual and corporate taxpayers. The IRS collects
gift
,
excise
,
estate
, and
income taxes
, and routinely conducts audits to ensure that taxpayers comply with tax laws.
Key Takeaways
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the U.S. government agency responsible for collecting federal taxes and enforcing tax laws.
Most of the work of the IRS involves individual and corporate income taxes.
The IRS audits taxpayers randomly or after detecting irregularities in tax returns.
Joules Garcia / Investopedia
History of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
President Abraham Lincoln created the Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1862 to collect
taxes
levied to fund the Civil War. In 1863, its first year in operation, it collected $39.1 million (the equivalent of $985.79 million today).

In 1913, Congress was given the power to enact income
tax laws
, paving the way for the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The first Form 1040 followed in 1914.

The agency’s name was changed to the Internal Revenue Service in 1953. The
filing deadline
was changed to April 15 the next year (1954).

Other highlights include:
1965—The IRS’s first toll-free telephone site
1972—The IRS offers information in Spanish for the first time
1992—The first
electronic filings
are allowed
1996—The IRS begins a presence on the World Wide Web, which precedes its IRS.gov website
2002—The IRS introduces its first app

Collecting Revenue
The IRS collects estimated taxes from wage earners throughout the year via payroll deductions and quarterly estimated tax payments from businesses based on quarterly tax filings. An annual filing, usually due by April 15 for the previous tax year, reconciles the amounts paid by each individual and business and the actual amounts owed.
If the
taxpayer
has overpaid, the IRS issues a
tax refund
. If the taxpayer owes money, the payment is due with the annual tax return. The
IRS website
explains how federal tax laws work. U.S. taxpayers must comply with tax laws passed by Congress and meet tax obligations.

$5.1+ trillion
The amount of tax revenue collected by the IRS in the 2024 fiscal year.
5
Tax Returns
Taxpayers may file their
tax returns
by mail or electronically using tax preparation software designed for consumer use. A taxpayer may use the services of tax professionals, such as
tax preparers
or
accountants
. Nearly all individual taxpayers use
Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return Definition, Types, and Use
or
Form 1040-SR: Tax Return for Seniors
. In 2024, the IRS received 163.4 million individual returns and issued 104.8 million refunds totaling $329 billion.
6
Many individuals complete and attach additional forms and documents to support the numbers they record on the main forms, including the
W-2
and
1099
, supplied by the companies that paid money to the taxpayer.
Schedule D
is used to report capital gains received from the sale of stocks, properties, and other taxable income sources, and
Schedule A
records the details of tax deductions claimed by the taxpayer.
Corporations use Form 1120: U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return to report their
income
and
tax liabilities
. There are variations of the form, depending on the type of corporation, including:
Form 1120-C: U.S. Income Tax Return for Cooperative Associations
Form 1120-F: U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation
Form 1120-H: U.S. Income Tax Return for Homeowners Associations
Form 1120-L: U.S. Life Insurance Company Income Tax Return
Form 1120-S: U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation
7
IRS Audits
The IRS
audits
a percentage of income tax returns annually as part of its enforcement mission. The agency randomly selects taxpayers to audit or singles out those whose returns are related to others audited. While there is no single factor that determines who gets an IRS audit each year, there are some
red flags
that may trigger a review:
Failing to declare the right amount of income
Claiming a higher-than-normal number of
deductions
(especially business-related ones)
Making disproportionately large
charitable donations
compared to income
Claiming rental real estate losses
The
audit process
begins with a review of the return by an auditor. The auditor may either accept the return or request a further review by an examination group. In the latter case, the taxpayer is notified by mail. The audit involves reviewing paperwork and may be conducted by mail or in person at an IRS office or another location, such as the taxpayer’s home, business, or accountant’s office.
8
Fast Fact
The IRS reported 582,944 audits as of the end of its 2023 fiscal year, resulting in $31.9 billion in recommended additional tax. Of all these audits, the IRS audited 0.44% of individual returns and 0.74% of corporate returns.
9
Contacting the IRS
A list of mailing addresses for the IRS is available on the IRS website.
10
Individuals can contact the IRS by phone at (800) 829-1040, Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time. There are other toll-free numbers for businesses and other purposes.
11
For online assistance, try the Interactive Tax Assistant on the IRS website.
12
In-person appointments are also available at a local IRS office.
13
How Is the IRS Funded?
The IRS operates on a
budget
approved by Congress. This is divided into four accounts: Taxpayer Services, Enforcement, Operations Support, and Business Systems Modernization. The money allotted to each cannot be reallocated to other sections.
14
IRS Chief Operating Officer Melanie Krause was announced in February 2025 as acting IRS commissioner.
15
What Is the Best Way to File a Tax Return?
It’s best to file taxes electronically, as 92.8% of taxpayers did with the IRS in 2024.
6
Individuals can still file a paper return by mail, but doing so will delay refunds.
16
What Are the Chances of Being Audited by the IRS?
The audit rate for individual tax returns was 0.44% in 2023. The IRS has audited the returns of 8.7% of the people making $10 million or more from 2013 to 2021.
17
Individuals may be randomly selected and others triggered by departures from the norm, such as a charitable deduction that exceeds the filer’s reported income.
The Bottom Line
The IRS emerged to collect money to fund the Civil War. The Internal Revenue Service is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and enforces and administers federal tax laws and operates within a budget approved by Congress.

Investopedia,"War Bonds: Characteristics, History, Pros & Cons, Example","Close
What Is a War Bond?
A war bond is a debt security issued by a government to finance military operations during times of war or conflict. Because war bonds offered a rate of return below the market rate, investment was achieved by making emotional appeals to patriotic citizens to lend the government money.
Key Takeaways
A war bond is an initiative by a government to fund military operations and spending by issuing debt for the public to purchase.
The public may buy these bonds out of a feeling of patriotic duty, or other emotional appeals.
Although war bonds do not typically pay interest, they are sold at a discount and mature to face value, typically after a period of 10 to 30 years.
Understanding War Bonds
A war bond is a debt instrument issued by a government as a means of borrowing money to finance its defense initiatives and military efforts during times of war. A war bond is essentially a loan to a government.
The bonds were sold below their face value—investors paid less than the face value initially and were paid the face value amount at maturity. In other words, war bonds were considered
zero-coupon bonds
because they didn't pay interest payments throughout the year or coupon payments. Instead, investors earned the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the bond at maturity.
War bonds were baby bonds, which meant they had a smaller
par value
, or face value, than standard bonds. This made them more affordable for retail investors. Another feature of the bonds was that they were nontransferable—only the bond purchaser could redeem the bonds in the future. War bonds originally had a 10-year maturity, which resulted in a 2.9% return.
Congress extended the interest that could be earned so that bonds sold from 1941 to 1965
accrued interest
for 40 years. Bonds issued after 1965 accrued interest for 20 years. After the end of World War II, War Bonds became known as Series E bonds. The U.S. government continued issuing Series E bonds until 1980 when Series EE bonds replaced them.
Characteristics of War Bonds
War bonds issued by the United States were a little different from other Treasury securities.
War bonds (or Liberty bonds, depending on the year) were
zero-coupon securities
, meaning that they did not pay any interest over the lifetime of the bond. Moreover, the face value was different from the actual price of the bond: You would buy the bond at a discount (typically between 50%-75% of the bond's face value) and receive the full face value when the bond matured.
The exact maturity date would depend on the year a war bond was issued. A bond issued at the beginning of World War II could only be cashed out ten years later. Congress later amended the law so that war bonds could continue to accumulate interest over 40 years.
The History of War Bonds
Besides the United States government, other countries also issued war bonds, including Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Austria-Hungary.
In the U.S., the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Motives to purchase war bonds were embedded in patriotism and conscience, given that these bonds offered a rate of return that was below the prevailing interest rates in the market.
Advertisements for the bonds were carried out through multiple media such as radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and newsreels in theaters to reach the American people. Hollywood stars like Bette Davis and Rita Hayworth helped promote war bonds by touring the country. People could save up for War Bonds by contributing 25 cents each time. The Girl Scouts also sold stamps valued at 10 cents each. Norman Rockwell created several paintings as part of the advertising effort for War Bonds.
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Ukrainian government announced an issue of war bonds to pay fighters and other military expenses. On March 1, just after the invasion began, the Ukrainian government announced that it had raised $270 million from a one-year bond with a yield of 11%.
1
The country issued several successive bond issues, raising a total of nearly $1 billion.
2
Advantages and Disadvantages of War Bonds
War bonds allow the issuing government to quickly raise money to fund military campaigns. Governments that issue war bonds may appeal to patriotic feelings to sell the war bonds, allowing them to offer a yield that is lower than current market rates. They can also be used to reduce inflation by removing extra money from the economy.
For investors, war bonds can also be a way to profit by speculating on the outcome of a war. If one side suffers from a temporary military defeat, investors can buy that country's war bonds if they expect a quick reversal. However, they also take the risk of losing their investment if the war is lost.
However, they were not always an ideal vehicle for investments. United States war bonds did not pay interest over the life of the bond, and they offered lower profits than competing bonds. Moreover, if a country borrows heavily to finance its war efforts, it will have to repay all of those bills upon the conclusion of the war.
Pros
War Bonds could be purchased for a price that was below their face value.
War Bonds were guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investors experienced a sense of pride and patriotism by helping the nation in times of war.
Cons
Paid a lower interest rate than other securities in the market.
War Bonds did not pay interest payments throughout the life of the bonds.
As with any security, War Bonds carried the risk of a loss if sold before maturity for a lower price than the purchase price.
Example of War Bonds
In the U.S., the sale of war bonds was overseen by the War Finance Committee. War bonds were initially known as Defense Bonds and were first issued as
Liberty Bonds
in 1917 to finance the United States government's participation in World War I. Through the sale of these bonds, the government raised $21.5 billion dollars for its war efforts.
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 7, 1941, the U.S. entered the Second World War, and Defense Bonds were renamed War Bonds. More than 80 million Americans purchased war bonds and brought in over $180 billion in revenue. The bonds sold for 50% to 75% of their
face value
and had denominations ranging from $10 to $1,000, depending on the year they were issued.
How Do You Buy Ukrainian War Bonds?
Ukrainian citizens and residents can buy war bonds through a Ukraine-licensed broker or bank. Although overseas institutional investors can also buy war bonds, it is not clear if they will be available to foreign retail investors.

What Is the Purpose of War Bonds?
War bonds allow a country to raise money for its military expenditures, without having to resort to heavy taxation or inflationary monetary policy. However, governments must be cautious of the risk that they will assume more debt than they can repay.
How Much Are War Bonds Worth Today?
The U.S. government has an online tool to calculate the current value of war bonds. For a Series E bond issued in 1942 with a face value of $100, the current value as of September 2022 would be $377.40.
4
The Bottom Line
War bonds allow a country to raise emergency funds to support military expenditures, at a lower cost than a typical sovereign bond issue. However, there is risk involved. War bonds tend to offer a lower yield, and investors assume the risk that they may lose the investment if the country defaults.

Definition
The dividend payout ratio indicates a dividend's sustainability based on how much of its earnings a company pays in dividends. It’s expressed as a percentage.
What Is the Dividend Payout Ratio?
The dividend payout ratio provides a measurement of earnings paid by a company to its shareholders in the form of dividends. The amount not paid to shareholders is retained by the company to pay off debt or to reinvest in its core operations. The dividend payout ratio is sometimes simply referred to as the payout ratio.
Key Takeaways
The dividend payout ratio is the proportion of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends.
Some companies pay out all their earnings to shareholders, some only pay out a portion of their earnings, while others don't pay any dividends to shareholders at all.
The portion of earnings that isn't paid is called the retention ratio.
Several considerations go into interpreting the dividend payout ratio, most importantly, the company's level of maturity.
Investopedia / Zoe Hansen
Formula and Calculation of the Dividend Payout Ratio
The dividend payout ratio can be calculated as the yearly dividend per share divided by the
earnings per share (EPS)
, or equivalently, the dividends divided by net income (as shown below).
Dividend Payout Ratio
=
Dividends Paid
Net Income
\begin{aligned} &\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Dividends Paid} }{ \text{Net Income} } \\ \end{aligned}
​
Dividend Payout Ratio
=
Net Income
Dividends Paid
​
​
Alternatively, the dividend payout ratio can also be calculated as:
Dividend Payout Ratio
=
1
−
Retention Ratio
\begin{aligned} &\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = 1 - \text{Retention Ratio} \\ \end{aligned}
​
Dividend Payout Ratio

On a per-share basis, the
retention ratio
can be expressed as:

where:
EPS
=
Earnings per share
DPS
=
Dividends per share
\begin{aligned}&\text{Retention Ratio} = \frac{ \text{EPS}-\text{DPS} }{ \text{EPS} } \\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{EPS}=\text{Earnings per share} \\&\text{DPS}=\text{Dividends per share}\end{aligned}

Important
The dividend payout ratio indicates how much money a company returns to shareholders versus how much it keeps to reinvest in growth, pay off debt, or add to cash reserves.
Calculating the Dividend Payout Ratio in Excel
If you are given the sum of the dividends over a certain period and the outstanding shares, you can calculate the
dividends per share (DPS)
. Suppose you are invested in a company that paid $5 million last year with five million shares outstanding. On Microsoft Excel, enter:
""Dividends per Share"" into cell A1.
""=5000000/5000000"" in cell B1, which means the dividend per share is $1 per share.
""Earnings per Share"" into cell A2

Suppose the company had a net income of $50 million last year. The formula for earnings per share is (Net income - Preferred Dividends) / Shares Outstanding.
Enter ""=(50000000 - 5000000)/5000000"" into cell B2, which means the EPS for this company is $9
Finally, calculate the payout ratio by entering:
""Payout Ratio"" into cell A3
""=B1/B2"" into cell B3, which gives a payout ratio of 11.11%
Investors use the ratio to gauge whether dividends are appropriate and sustainable. The payout ratio depends on the sector. For example, startups may have a low or no payout ratio because they are more focused on reinvesting their income to grow the business.
Understanding the Dividend Payout Ratio
The dividend payout ratio is 0% for companies that do not pay dividends and 100% for companies that pay out their entire net income as dividends.
Several considerations go into interpreting the dividend payout ratio—most importantly, the company's level of maturity.
A new, growth-oriented company that aims to expand, develop new products, and move into new markets would be expected to reinvest most or all of its earnings and could be forgiven for having a
low or even zero payout ratio
.
An older, established company that returns a pittance to shareholders would test investors' patience and could tempt
activists
to intervene to boost the payout ratio.
In 2012 and after about 17 years since its last dividend, Apple (
AAPL
) began to pay a dividend when the new chief executive officer (CEO) felt the company's enormous cash flow made a 0% payout ratio difficult to justify.

Since higher dividends are often a sign that a company has moved past its initial growth stage, a higher payout ratio means share prices are unlikely to appreciate rapidly.
Dividend Sustainability
The payout ratio is also useful for assessing a
dividend's sustainability
. Companies are extremely reluctant to cut dividends because it can drive the stock price down and reflect poorly on management's abilities.
If a company's payout ratio is over 100%, it returns more money to shareholders in the year it earned and may be forced to lower the dividend or stop paying it altogether, since overpayment is likely to be unsustainable.
A company may endure a bad year without
suspending payouts
. It is often in its interest to do so because investors will expect a dividend.
Not paying one can be an extremely negative signal about where the company is headed. Investors react badly to companies paying lower-than-expected dividends, which is why share prices fall when dividends are cut.
Long-term trends in the payout ratio also matter. A steadily rising ratio could indicate a healthy, maturing business, but a spiking one could mean the dividend is heading into unsustainable territory.
The retention ratio is the converse concept to the dividend payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio evaluates the percentage of profits earned that a company pays out to its shareholders, while the retention ratio represents the percentage of profits earned that are retained by or reinvested in the company.
Dividends Are Industry Specific
Dividend payouts vary widely by industry, and like most ratios, they are most useful to compare within a given industry.
For example,
real estate investment trusts (REITs)
are legally obligated to distribute at least 90% of earnings to shareholders as they enjoy special tax exemptions.
Master limited partnerships (MLPs)
tend to have high payout ratios, as well.
3
Dividends are not the only way companies can return value to shareholders. Therefore, the payout ratio does not always provide a complete picture.
The augmented payout ratio incorporates share buybacks into the metric, which is calculated by dividing the sum of dividends and buybacks by net income for the same period. If the result is too high, it can indicate an emphasis on short-term boosts to share prices at the expense of reinvestment and long-term growth.
Another adjustment that can be made to provide a more accurate picture is to subtract preferred stock dividends for companies that issue preferred shares.
Dividend Payout Ratio vs. Dividend Yield
When
comparing these two measures
, it's important to know that the dividend yield tells you what the simple rate of return is in the form of cash dividends to shareholders, but the dividend payout ratio represents how much of a company's net earnings are paid out as dividends.
While the dividend yield is the more commonly known and scrutinized term, many believe the dividend payout ratio is a better indicator of a company's ability to distribute dividends consistently in the future. The dividend payout ratio is highly connected to a company's cash flow.
The dividend yield shows how much a company paid out in dividends a year
as a percentage of the stock price. It shows for a dollar spent on the stock how much you will yield in dividends.
The yield is presented as a percentage, not as an actual dollar amount. This makes it easier to see how much return per dollar invested the shareholder receives through dividends.
The yield is calculated as:
Dividend Yield
=
Annual Dividends per Share
Price per Share
\begin{aligned} &\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{ \text{Annual Dividends per Share} }{ \text{Price per Share} } \end{aligned}
​
Dividend Yield
=
Price per Share
Annual Dividends per Share
​
​
For example, a company that paid $10 in annual dividends per share on a stock trading at $100 per share has a dividend ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendpayoutratio.asp

What Is a Junk Bond?
Junk bonds are bonds that carry a higher risk of default than most bonds issued by corporations and governments. A bond is a debt or promise to pay investors interest payments along with the return of invested principal in exchange for buying the bond. Junk bonds represent bonds issued by companies that are financially struggling and have a high risk of
defaulting
or not paying their interest payments or repaying the principal to investors.
Junk bonds are also called
high-yield
bonds since the higher yield is needed to help offset any risk of default.
Key Takeaways
A junk bond is debt that has been given a low credit rating by a ratings agency, below investment grade.
As a result, these bonds are riskier since chances that the issuer will default or experience a credit event are higher.
Because of the higher risk, investors are compensated with higher interest rates, which is why junk bonds are also called high-yield bonds.
Junk Bonds Explained
From a technical viewpoint, a high-yield, or ""junk"" bond is very similar to regular corporate bonds. Both represent debt issued by a firm with the promise to pay interest and to return the principal at maturity. Junk bonds differ because of their issuers' poorer credit quality.
Bonds are fixed-income debt instruments that corporations and governments issue to investors to raise capital. When investors buy bonds, they're effectively loaning money to the issuer who promises to repay the money on a specific date called the maturity date. At maturity, the investor is repaid the principal amount invested. Most bonds pay investors an annual interest rate during the life of the bond, called a coupon rate.
For example, a bond that has a 5% annual coupon rate means that an investor who purchases the bond earns 5% per year. So, a bond with a $1,000 face—or par—value will receive 5% x $1,000 which comes to $50 each year until the bond matures.
Higher Risk Equates to Higher Yield
A bond that has a high risk of the underlying company defaulting is called a junk bond. Companies that issue junk bonds are typically start-ups or companies that are struggling financially. Junk bonds carry risk since investors are unsure whether they'll be repaid their principal and earn regular interest payments. As a result, junk bonds pay a higher yield than their safer counterparts to help compensate investors for the added level of risk. Companies are willing to pay the high yield because they need to attract investors to fund their operations.
Pros
Junk bonds return higher yields than most other fixed-income debt securities.
Junk bonds have the potential of significant price increases should the company's financial situation improve.
Junk bonds serve as a risk indicator of when investors are willing to take on risk or avoid risk in the market.
Cons
Junk bonds have a higher risk of default than most bonds with better credit ratings.
Junk bond prices can exhibit volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the issuer's financial performance.
Active junk bond markets can indicate an overbought market meaning investors are too complacent with risk and may lead to market downturns.
Junk Bonds as a Market Indicator
Some investors buy junk bonds to profit from potential price increases as the financial security of the underlying company improves, and not necessarily for the return of interest income. Also, investors that predict bond prices to rise are betting there will be increased buying interest for high-yield bonds—even these lower rated ones—due to a change in
market risk sentiment
. For example, if investors believe economic conditions are improving in the U.S. or abroad, they
might purchase junk bonds of companies that will show improvement along with the economy.
As a result, increased buying interest of junk bonds serves as a market-risk indicator for some investors. If investors are buying junk bonds, market participants are willing to take on more risk due to a perceived improving economy. Conversely, if junk bonds are selling off with prices falling, it usually means that investors are more
risk averse
and are opting for more secure and stable investments.
Although a surge in junk bond investing usually translates to increased optimism in the market, it could also point to too much optimism in the market.
It's important to note that junk bonds have much larger price swings than bonds of higher quality. Investors looking to purchase junk bonds can either buy the bonds individually through a broker or invest in a junk bond fund managed by a professional portfolio manager.
Improving Financials Affect Junk Bonds
If the underlying company performs well financially, its bonds will have improved credit ratings and usually attract buying interest from investors. As a result, the bond's price rises as investors flood in, willing to pay for the financially viable issuer. Conversely, companies that are performing poorly will likely have low or lowered credit ratings. These falling opinions might cause buyers to back off. Companies with poor credit ratings typically offer high yields to attract investors and to compensate them for the added level of risk.
The result is bonds issued by companies with positive credit ratings usually pay lower interest rates on their debt instruments as compared to companies with poor credit ratings. Many bond investors monitor the credit ratings of bonds.
Credit Ratings and Junk Bonds
Although junk bonds are considered risky investments, investors can monitor a bond's level of risk by reviewing the bond's credit rating. A
credit rating
is an assessment of the creditworthiness of an issuer and its outstanding debt in the form of bonds. The company's credit rating, and ultimately the bond's credit rating, impact the market price of a bond and its offering interest rate.
Credit-rating agencies
measure the creditworthiness of all corporate and government bonds, giving investors insight into the risks involved in the debt securities. Credit rating agencies assign letter grades for their view of the issue.
For example, Standard & Poor’s has a credit rating scale ranging from AAA—excellent—to lower ratings of C and D. Any bond that carries a rating lower than BB is said to be of speculative-grade or a junk bond. This should be a red flag to risk-averse investors. The various letter grades from credit agencies represent the financial viability of the company and the likelihood that the contract terms of the bond terms will be honored.
Investment Grade
Bonds with a rating of
investment-grade
come from corporations that have a high probability of paying the regular coupons and returning the principal to investors. For example, Standard & Poor's ratings include:
AAA—excellent
AA—very good
A—good
BBB—adequate
""Junk"" (Speculative)
As mentioned earlier, once a bond's rating drops into the double-B category, it falls into the junk bond territory. This area can be a scary place for investors who would be harmed by a total loss of their investment dollars in the case of a default.
Some speculative ratings include:
CCC—currently vulnerable to nonpayment
C—highly vulnerable to nonpayment
D—in default
Companies having bonds with these low credit ratings might have difficulty raising the capital needed to fund ongoing business operations. However, if a company manages to improve its financial performance and it's bond's credit rating is upgraded, a substantial appreciation in the bond’s price could happen. Conversely, if a company's financial situation deteriorates, the credit rating of the company and its bonds might be downgraded by credit rating agencies. It is crucial for investors in junk debt to fully investigate the underlying business and all financial documents available before buying.
Bond Defaults
If a bond misses a principal and interest payment, the bond is considered to be in default. Default is the failure to repay a debt including interest or principal on a loan or security. Junk bonds have a higher risk of default because of an uncertain revenue stream or a lack of sufficient collateral. The risk of bond defaults increases during economic downturns making these bottom level debts even riskier.
Real World Example of a Junk Bond
Tesla Inc. (TSLA) issued a
fixed-rate bond
with a maturity date of March 1, 2021 and a fixed semi-annual coupon rate of 1.25%. The debt received an S&P rating of B- in 2014 when it was issued. In October 2020, S&P upgraded its rating to BB- from B+. This is still in junk bond rating territory. A BB rating from S&P means the rating issue is less vulnerable to nonpayment, but",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp

What Is a Prospectus?
A prospectus is a written document used in finance to inform the public of the relevant details about an offering of securities, such as stocks,
bonds
, and
mutual funds
. The prospectus is part of a company's registration statement, which must be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
.
1
Key details on a prospectus include the number of units, the offering price, and how the company intends to use the capital it raises from the sale. Companies update their prospectuses each year. Investors can obtain prospectus reports by visiting the SEC EDGAR database.
2
However, investors will also find that the
best online brokerage and trading platforms
provide access to prospectus reports, which may be easier to read.
Key Takeaways
A prospectus is a document companies use to give the public relevant information about an offering of securities.
The information in a prospectus includes the company's profile, the securities offered, investment objectives, the use of capital, and risk factors.
Investors can use the prospectus to help them make important investment decisions.
Companies must file prospectuses with the SEC and use them as marketing and sales tools.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Components of a Prospectus
The prospectus is a required disclosure document. As such, it must include all material information about the company, the offering, and any other relevant details.
Company information:
The prospectus should outline information about the company, how it operates, and its products and services.
Management team:
This section includes the names of the company's key officers, their bios, and any other relevant information, such as pay/compensation.
Financial statements:
The company highlights its financial history and includes
financial statements
like its balance sheet, income statement, and
statement of cash flows
.
Details of the offering:
The prospectus should detail the type of
security
, the offering price, and the number of units the company wants to sell. If the company intends to sell
stock shares
, it should also detail the structure along with the number of
authorized and outstanding shares
.
How capital will be used:
The company explains how it intends to use the
capital
raised from investors.
Investment objectives and results:
Management outlines the investment's objectives (especially in the case of a mutual fund) and provides its
financial performance
over time.
Other key information detailed in the prospectus includes the company's competition, any
risks
a potential investor may face if they invest in the company,
market conditions
that could impact the company, and how the company intends to grow in the future.

Important
Contact the company or your broker for a copy of the prospectus. You can also find a company's registration statement through
EDGAR
, the SEC's online portal for public company filings for new stock issues, or the
mutual fund prospectus site
.
Uses of a Prospectus
A prospectus helps investors and companies for different reasons. Investors can use this document to gain insightful information about potential investments, while companies can use it to attract new investors.
For Investors
A prospectus is a valuable tool to help investors decide whether to invest in the company. The prospectus provides investors with important information about an upcoming offering and other key details about the
company's management team
, risk factors, the
financial history of the company
and the investment. The prospectus also informs investors on how the company intends to use the money it raises from the sale of its
securities
.
For Companies
A company produces a prospectus for two reasons. The first is to attract new buyers and investors by providing background about the company, its history, and details about its
management team
. Companies can use the prospectus as a marketing or sales tool that gives investors insight into the offering of its new security, including where and how it will trade, how much the units cost, and how they can purchase them.
The second purpose of the prospectus from a corporate perspective is to remain compliant with financial regulators—notably the SEC. Companies preparing for an
initial public offering (IPO)
must complete and file a registration statement called
SEC Form S-1
—including a prospectus—with the SEC before they can issue the securities. Mutual funds update their prospectuses each year.

How to Read a Prospectus
For investors to get a lot out of a prospectus, there are some critical sections to review. You can gain a lot of information from the summary, which highlights the details about the offering, the reasons behind it, and an overview of the associated risks.
Other sections to focus on include:
Risk factors:
This section helps you understand what factors may hurt your investment. For instance, the prospectus may outline risks like
exchange rates
, economic factors, market risks, and failure risks if the company faces challenges.
Financial statements:
Documents like the company's
balance sheet
, cash flow statement, and
income statement
can give you insight into the financial health and well-being of the company.
Investment costs:
Read about the fees and any other charges associated with the potential investment. These costs can eat away at your capital over time.
Use of capital:
This section outlines how the company will use the money it raises from the sale of its securities. This is key, as it can signal whether the company is financially healthy and if it plans on investing this capital in its growth.
Investment objectives:
This section is key because you can determine whether your goals align with those of the investment and the company.
Since a prospectus contains a lot of legalese or financial jargon, be sure to consult an
investment advisor
if you're
unfamiliar with investing terminology
and need clarification.
Example of a Prospectus
See the prospectus summary filed by Zoom Video Communications (
ZM
) filed on March 22, 2019, (linked
here
).

The company prepared the filing before selling its Class A common stock to the public.
In the summary, the company outlined its history and corporate profile, which includes the business model along with its products and services.
Zoom also highlighted the industry trends, competitive landscape, market, and growth strategy before diving into the risks (found on page 6 of the prospectus). These risks included its limited operating history, delays, failures in internet
infrastructure

Investopedia,CBOE Volatility Index (VIX): What Does It Measure in Investing?,"Close
Definition
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the Fear Index, measures expected market volatility using a portfolio of options on the S&P 500.
What Is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)?
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time index that represents the market’s expectations for the relative strength of near-term price changes of the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Because it is derived from the prices of SPX index options with near-term expiration dates, it generates a 30-day forward projection of volatility.
Volatility
, or how fast prices change, is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment, and in particular the degree of fear among market participants.
The index is more commonly known by its ticker symbol and is often referred to simply as “the VIX.” It was created by the CBOE Options Exchange and is maintained by CBOE Global Markets. It is an important index in the world of trading and investment because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors’ sentiments.
Key Takeaways
The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days.
Investors use the VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions.
Traders can also trade the VIX using a variety of options and exchange-traded products, or they can use VIX values to price derivatives.
The VIX generally rises when stocks fall, and declines when stocks rise.
How Does the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Work?
The VIX attempts to measure the magnitude of price movements of the S&P 500 (i.e., its volatility). The more dramatic the price swings are in the index, the higher the level of volatility, and vice versa.
In addition to being an index to measure volatility, traders can also trade VIX futures, options, and ETFs to hedge or speculate on volatility changes in the index.
In general, volatility can be measured using two different methods. The first method is based on historical volatility, using statistical calculations on previous prices over a specific time period. This process involves computing various statistical numbers, like
mean
(average),
variance
, and finally, the
standard deviation
on the historical price data sets.

The second method, which the VIX uses, involves inferring its value as implied by options prices. Options are derivative instruments whose price depends upon the probability of a particular stock’s current price moving enough to reach a particular level (called the
strike price
or
exercise price
).
Since the possibility of such price moves happening within the given time frame is represented by the volatility factor, various option pricing methods (like the
Black-Scholes model
) include volatility as an integral input parameter.
Since option prices are available in the open market, they can be used to derive the volatility of the underlying security. Such volatility, as implied by or inferred from market prices, is called forward-looking
implied volatility
(IV).
Extending Volatility to Market Level
The VIX was the first benchmark index introduced by CBOE to measure the market’s expectation of future volatility.
Being a forward-looking index, it is constructed using the implied volatilities on S&P 500
index options
and represents the market’s expectation of 30-day future volatility of the S&P 500 Index, which is considered the leading indicator of the broad U.S. stock market.
1
Introduced in 1993, the VIX is now an established and globally recognized gauge of U.S. equity market volatility. It is calculated in real time based on the live prices of the S&P 500 Index. Calculations are performed and values are relayed from 3 a.m. to 9:15 a.m., and from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. EST. CBOE began the dissemination of the VIX outside of U.S. trading hours in April 2016.
1
Calculation of VIX Values
VIX values are calculated using the CBOE-traded standard SPX options, which expire on the third Friday of each month, and the weekly SPX options, which expire on all other Fridays. Only SPX options are considered whose expiry period lies within more than 23 days and less than 37 days.
2
While the formula is mathematically complex, it theoretically works as follows: It estimates the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index by aggregating the weighted prices of multiple SPX puts and calls over a wide range of strike prices.
3
All such qualifying options should have valid nonzero bid and ask prices that represent the market perception of which options’ strike prices will be hit by the underlying stocks during the remaining time to expiry.
For detailed calculations with an example, one can refer to the section “The VIX Index Calculation: Step-by-Step” of the VIX
white paper
.
Evolution of the VIX
During its origin in 1993, VIX was calculated as a weighted measure of the implied volatility of eight S&P 100
at-the-money
put
and
call options
, when the derivatives market had limited activity and was in its growing stages.
4
As the derivatives markets matured, 10 years later, in 2003, the CBOE teamed up with Goldman Sachs and updated the methodology to calculate VIX differently.
1
It then started using a wider set of options based on the broader S&P 500 Index, an expansion that allows for a more accurate view of investors’ expectations of future market volatility. A methodology was adopted that remains in effect and is also used for calculating various other variants of the volatility index.
1
VIX vs. S&P 500 Price
Volatility values, investors’ fears, and VIX values all move up when the market is falling. The reverse is true when the market advances—the index values, fear, and volatility decline.
The price action of the S&P 500 and the VIX
often shows inverse price action
: when the S&P falls sharply, the VIX rises—and vice versa.
Note
As a rule of thumb, VIX values greater than 30 are generally linked to large volatility resulting from increased uncertainty, risk, and investors’ fear. VIX values below 20 generally correspond to stable, stress-free periods in the markets.
How to Trade the VIX
The VIX has paved the way for using volatility as a tradable asset, albeit through derivative products. CBOE launched the first VIX-based exchange-traded
futures contract
in March 2004, followed by the launch of VIX options in February 2006.
1
Such VIX-linked instruments allow pure volatility exposure and have created a new asset class. Active traders, large institutional investors, and hedge fund managers use the VIX-linked securities for portfolio diversification, as historical data demonstrate a strong negative
correlation
of volatility to the stock market returns—that is, when stock returns go down, volatility rises, and vice versa.
Like all indexes, one cannot buy the VIX directly. Instead, investors can take a position in VIX through futures or options contracts, or through VIX-based
exchange-traded products
(ETPs). For example, the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (
VIXY
) and the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (
VXX
) are two such offerings that track a certain VIX-variant index and take positions in linked futures contracts.
Note
Options and futures based on VIX products are available for trading on CBOE and CFE platforms, respectively.
Active traders who employ their own trading strategies and advanced algorithms use VIX values to price the derivatives, which are based on high beta stocks.
Beta
represents how much a particular stock price can move with respect to the move in a broader market index.
For instance, a stock having a beta of +1.5 indicates that it is theoretically 50% more volatile than the market. Traders making bets through options of such high beta stocks utilize the VIX volatility values in appropriate proportion to correctly price their options trades.
Following the popularity of the VIX, the CBOE now offers several other variants for measuring broad market volatility.
Examples include the CBOE Short-Term Volatility Index (VIX9D), which reflects the nine-day expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index; the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VIX3M); and the CBOE S&P 500 6-Month Volatility Index (VIX6M). Products based on other market indexes include the Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (
VXN
); the CBOE DJIA Volatility Index (
VXD
); and the CBOE Russell 2000 Volatility Index (
RVX
).
5
What Does the VIX Tell Us?
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) signals the level of fear or stress in the stock market—using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the broad market—and hence is widely known as the “Fear Index.” Irrational investor behaviors can be spurred on by the
availability of real-time news coverage
. The higher the VIX, the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market, with levels above 30 indicating tremendous uncertainty.
How Can an Investor Trade the VIX?
Like all indices, the VIX cannot be bought directly. However, the VIX can be traded through futures contracts,
exchange-traded funds
(ETFs), and
exchange-traded notes
(ETNs) that own these futures contracts.
Does the Level of the VIX Affect Option Premiums and Prices?
Yes, it does. Volatility is one of the primary factors that affect stock and index options’ prices and premiums. As the VIX is the most widely watched measure of broad market volatility, it has a substantial impact on option prices or premiums. A higher VIX means higher prices for options (i.e., more expensive option premiums) while a lower VIX means lower option prices or cheaper premiums.
How Can I Use the VIX Level to Hedge Downside Risk?
Downside risk
can be adequately hedged by buying put options, the price of which depends on market volatility. Astute inves",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp

A Monte Carlo simulation estimates the likelihood of different outcomes by accounting for the presence of random variables.
What Is a Monte Carlo Simulation?
A Monte Carlo simulation is a way to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of
random variables
. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations can be applied to a range of problems in many fields, including investing, business, physics, and engineering. It is also referred to as a multiple probability simulation.
Key Takeaways
Monte Carlo simulations help forecast a range of possible results by simulating the impact of randomness in a system.
A Monte Carlo simulation requires assigning multiple values to an uncertain variable to achieve multiple results and then averaging the results to obtain an estimate.
These simulations assume perfectly efficient markets.
Monte Carlo simulations are increasingly used in conjunction with artificial intelligence.
Eliana Rodgers / Investopedia
How the Monte Carlo Simulation Assesses Risk
When faced with significant uncertainty in making a forecast or estimate, some methods replace the uncertain variable with a single average number. The Monte Carlo simulation instead uses multiple values and then averages the results.
Monte Carlo simulations have a vast array of applications in fields that are plagued by random variables, notably business and investing. They are used to estimate the probability of cost overruns in large projects and the likelihood that an asset price will move in a certain way.
Telecoms
use them to assess network performance in various scenarios, which helps them to optimize their networks. Insurers use them to measure the risks they may be taking on and to price their policies accordingly. Investment analysts use
Monte Carlo simulations to assess the risk
that an entity will default, and to analyze
derivatives
such as options. Financial planners can use them to predict the likelihood that a client will
run out of money in retirement
.

Monte Carlo simulations also have many applications outside of business and finance, such as in meteorology, astronomy, and physics.

Today, Monte Carlo simulations are increasingly being used in conjunction with new
artificial intelligence (AI)
models. For example, as IBM noted in 2024, many financial firms now use high performance computing systems to run Monte Carlo simulations and, ""As the numbers of these simulations grow over ever-increasing portfolios of financial assets and instruments, the interpretation of these as an entirety becomes a growing challenge."" That is where AI comes in. ""The use of AI to assist a professional in their assessment of these simulations can both improve accuracy as well as deliver more timely insights. In a business where time-to-market is a key differentiator, this has direct business value,"" IBM says.
2
History of the Monte Carlo Simulation
The Monte Carlo simulation was named after the famous gambling destination in Monaco because chance and random outcomes are central to this modeling technique, as they are to games like roulette, dice, and slot machines.
The technique was initially developed by Stanislaw Ulam, a mathematician who worked on the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the first atomic weapon. He shared his idea with John Von Neumann, a colleague at the Manhattan Project, and the two collaborated to refine the Monte Carlo simulation.
3
How Monte Carlo Simulations Work
The Monte Carlo method acknowledges an issue for any simulation technique: The probability of varying outcomes cannot be firmly pinpointed because of random variable interference. Therefore, a Monte Carlo simulation focuses on constantly repeating random samples.
A Monte Carlo simulation takes the variable that has uncertainty and assigns it a random value. The model is then run, and a result is provided. This process is repeated again and again while assigning many different values to the variable in question. Once the simulation is complete, the results are averaged to arrive at an estimate.
The 4 Steps in a Monte Carlo Simulation
To perform a Monte Carlo simulation, there are four main steps. As an example, Microsoft
Excel
or a similar program can be used to create a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the probable price movements of stocks or other assets.
There are two components to an asset's price movement: drift, which is its constant directional movement, and a random input, which represents market
volatility
.
By analyzing historical price data, you can determine the drift,
standard deviation
,
variance
, and average price movement of a security. These are the building blocks of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The four steps are as follows:
Step 1.
To project one possible price trajectory, use the historical price data of the asset to generate a series of periodic daily returns using the natural logarithm (note that this equation differs from the usual percentage change formula):
Periodic Daily Return
=
l
n
(
Day’s Price
Previous Day’s Price
)
\begin{aligned} &\text{Periodic Daily Return} = ln \left ( \frac{ \text{Day's Price} }{ \text{Previous Day's Price} } \right ) \\ \end{aligned}
​
Periodic Daily Return
=
l
n
(
Previous Day’s Price
Day’s Price
​
)
​
Step 2.
Next, use the AVERAGE, STDEV.P, and VAR.P functions on the entire resulting series to obtain the average daily return, standard deviation, and variance inputs, respectively. The drift is equal to:
Drift
=
Average Daily Return
−
Variance
2
where:
Average Daily Return
=
Produced from Excel’s
AVERAGE function from periodic daily returns series
Variance
=
Produced from Excel’s
VAR.P function from periodic daily returns series
\begin{aligned} &\text{Drift} = \text{Average Daily Return} - \frac{ \text{Variance} }{ 2 } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{Average Daily Return} = \text{Produced from Excel's} \\ &\text{AVERAGE function from periodic daily returns series} \\ &\text{Variance} = \text{Produced from Excel's} \\ &\text{VAR.P function from periodic daily returns series} \\ \end{aligned}
​
Drift
=
Average Daily Return
−
2
Variance
​
where:
Average Daily Return
=
Produced from Excel’s
AVERAGE function from periodic daily returns series
Variance
=
Produced from Excel’s
VAR.P function from periodic daily returns series
​
Alternatively, drift can be set to 0; this choice reflects a certain theoretical orientation, but the difference will not be huge, at least for shorter time frames.
Step 3.
Next, obtain a random input:
Random Value
=
σ
×
NORMSINV(RAND())
where:
σ
=
Standard deviation, produced from Excel’s
STDEV.P function from periodic daily returns series
NORMSINV and RAND
=
Excel functions
\begin{aligned} &\text{Random Value} = \sigma \times \text{NORMSINV(RAND())} \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\sigma = \text{Standard deviation, produced from Excel's} \\ &\text{STDEV.P function from periodic daily returns series} \\ &\text{NORMSINV and RAND} = \text{Excel functions} \\ \end{aligned}
​
Random Value
=
σ
×
NORMSINV(RAND())
where:
σ
=
Standard deviation, produced from Excel’s
STDEV.P function from periodic daily returns series
NORMSINV and RAND
=
Excel functions
​
The equation for the following day's price is:
Next Day’s Price
=
Today’s Price
×
e
(
Drift
+
Random Value
)
\begin{aligned} &\text{Next Day's Price} = \text{Today's Price} \times e^{ ( \text{Drift} + \text{Random Value} ) }\\ \end{aligned}
​
Next Day’s Price
=
Today’s Price
×
e
(
Drift
+
Random Value
)
​
Step 4.
To take
e
to a given power
x
in Excel, use the EXP function: EXP(x). Repeat this calculation the desired number of times. (Each repetition represents one day.) The result is a simulation of the asset's future price movement.
By generating an arbitrary number of simulations, you can assess the probability that a security's price will follow a given trajectory.
Monte Carlo Simulation Results Explained
The frequencies of different outcomes generated by this simulation will form a
normal distribution
—that is, a
bell curve
. The most likely return is in the middle of the curve, meaning there is an equal chance that the actual return will be higher or lower.
The probability that the actual return will be within one standard deviation of the most probable (""expected"") rate is 68%. The probability is 95% that it will",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp

Definition
The Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) is the annual cap set by Canada on earnings eligible for contributions to the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan.
What Is Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE)?
The Canadian government sets the year's maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE) figure. The YMPE determines the maximum amount on which to base contributions to the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP). The YMPE specifies the
earnings
amount that can be used in calculating pension contributions for each year.

Key Takeaways
The YMPE determines the maximum earnings amount for contributions to the CPP.

The maximum pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for 2022 are $64,900.
3
The size of those payments depends on an individual's earnings during their working years, the age an individual starts receiving their pension, and how much and for how long an individual contributes to the CPP.
4
Understanding Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE)
The
Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
determines the maximum earnings amount for which contributions to the Canada Pension Plan can be made. According to the Government of Canada, the maximum pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for 2022 is $64,900—up from $61,600 in 2021. Contributors who earn more than $64,900 in 2022 cannot make additional contributions to the CPP.

Important
Beginning in 2024, a separate contribution rate will be implemented for earnings above the YMPE (expected to be 4% each for employers and employees).
5
Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings and CPP Contributions
The Canada Pension Plan is similar to the
Social Security
program in the United States. It provides workers with a series of monthly payments in retirement.
6
The size of those payments depends on an individual's earnings during their working years.
4
On June 20, 2016, Canada's ministers of finance agreed to augment the CPP. The deal increased how much working Canadians would receive from the CPP—from one-quarter of the employees' eligible earnings to one-third, with a boost to the earnings limit. Changes will be phased in gradually over seven years—from 2019 to 2025—so that the impact is measured and piecemeal.

What Is the Law of Supply?
The law of supply is a
microeconomic
law. It states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of that good or service that suppliers offer will increase, and vice versa.
In plain terms, this law means that as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their
profits
by increasing the number of that item that they sell.
Key Takeaways
The law of supply says that a higher price will lead producers to supply a higher quantity to the market.
Because businesses seek to increase revenue, when they expect to receive a higher price for something, they will produce more of it.
Meanwhile, if prices fall, suppliers are disincentivized from producing as much.
Supply in a market can be depicted as an upward-sloping supply curve that shows how the quantity supplied will respond to various prices over a period of time.
Together with demand, the law of supply forms half of the law of supply and demand.
Daniel Fishel / Investopedia
Understanding the Law of Supply
The chart below depicts the law of supply using a
supply curve
, which is upward sloping. A, B, and C are points on the supply curve. Each point on the curve reflects a direct correlation between quantity supplied (Q) and price (P). So, at point A, the quantity supplied will be Q1 and the price will be P1, and so on.
Julie Bang / Investopedia
The supply curve slopes upward because, over time, suppliers can choose how much of their goods to produce and later bring to market. At any given point in time, however, the
supply
that sellers bring to market is fixed, and sellers simply face a decision to either sell or withhold their stock from a sale; consumer
demand
sets the price, and sellers can only charge what the market will bear.
If consumer demand rises over time, the price will rise, and suppliers can choose to devote new resources to production (or new suppliers can enter the market), which increases the
quantity supplied
. Demand ultimately sets the price in a competitive market; supplier response to the price they can expect to receive sets the quantity supplied.

. It works with the law of demand to explain how market economies allocate resources and determine the prices of goods and services.
Fast Fact
British economist
Alfred Marshall
(1842–1924), a specialist in microeconomics, contributed significantly to supply theory, especially in his pioneering use of the supply curve. He emphasized that the price and output of a good are determined by both supply and demand; the two curves are like scissor blades that intersect at equilibrium.
1
Examples of the Law of Supply
The law of supply summarizes the effect that price changes have on producer behavior. For example, a business will make more video game systems if the price of those systems increases. The opposite is true if the price of video game systems decreases. The company might supply 1 million systems if the price is $200 each, but if the price increases to $300, they might supply 1.5 million systems.
To further illustrate this concept, consider how gas prices work. When the price of gasoline rises, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take actions to expand supply, such as:
Increase exploration for oil reserves
Drill for more oil
Invest in more pipelines and tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline
Build new oil refineries
Purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations
Open more gas stations
Keep existing gas stations open longer hours
The law of supply is so intuitive that you may not even be aware of all the examples around you. For example, when college students learn that computer engineering jobs pay more than English professor jobs, the supply of students with majors in computer engineering increases. If consumers start paying more for cupcakes than for doughnuts, bakeries will increase their output of cupcakes and reduce their output of doughnuts to increase their profits.
The law of supply can even impact your own employment. When your employer pays time and a half for overtime, the number of hours you are willing to supply for work might increase.
What Are the Types of Law of Supply?
There are five types of supply: market supply, short-term supply, long-term supply, joint supply, and composite supply. Meanwhile, there are two types of supply curves: individual supply curves and market supply curves. Individual supply curves graph the individual supply schedule, while market supply curves represent the market supply schedule.
What Factors Affect Supply?
Supply is influenced by prices and consumer demand. The number of suppliers available, the level of competition, the state of technology, and the presence of government support or restriction will play important roles. For certain products like agricultural commodities, supply is also impacted by factors such as weather and crop yields.
What Is the Law of Demand?
The
law of demand
is a fundamental principle of economics that states that at a higher price, consumers will demand a lower quantity of a good, and vice versa.
What Is Supply and Demand?
The
law of supply and demand
outlines the interaction between a buyer and a seller of a resource. Supply and demand law says that sellers will supply less of a product or resource as price decreases, while buyers will buy more, and vice versa, until an equilibrium price and quantity are reached. It incorporates both the law of supply and the law of demand.
2
The Bottom Line
The law of supply states that a higher price for a good or service will lead producers to supply more of that good or service to the market. This is because businesses want to increase their profits. When they can get a higher price for something, they will produce more of it than they will of other, lower-priced goods and services.
On the other hand, if prices fall, suppliers won’t produce as much. The law of supply is one part of the law of supply and demand.

A negative correlation means that two variables move in opposite directions from one another: when one rises, the other falls.
What Is Negative Correlation?
It's important for investors to understand the concept of negative correlation since balanced portfolios often include assets that have this relationship with one another. That way, should one part drop in value, others might not.
Negative correlation is also called inverse correlation, which is a relationship between two variables in which one increases as the other decreases, and vice versa. A perfectly negative correlation means the relationship that exists between two variables is exactly opposite. In a line graph, you would see a downward slope.
In economics, price and quantity are generally negatively correlated on a demand curve. These are almost always downward-sloping, reflecting the willingness of consumers to buy more of something as its price goes lower.
Key Takeaways
Negative correlation is put to use when constructing diversified portfolios so that investors can benefit from price increases in certain assets when others fall.
Correlations between two variables are often unstable and can vary widely over time.
Stocks and bonds generally have a negative correlation. Therefore, traditional portfolios tend to hold both.
Investing in negatively correlated assets can cut portfolio risk, but it can also minimize potential gains.
Investopedia / Ellen Lindner
How Negative Correlation Works
Negative or
inverse correlation
indicates that two individual variables have prices that generally move in opposite directions. If, for instance, variables X and Y have a negative correlation, as X increases in value, Y will decrease; similarly, if X decreases in value, Y will increase.
In statistics, a perfectly negative
correlation
is represented by the value -1.0, while 0 indicates no correlation, and +1.0 indicates a perfectly positive correlation. The supply curve is almost always upward-sloping and represented with a positive correlation, reflecting how producers are willing to bring more of a product to the market as prices go higher.
However, in most real-world scenarios, negative correlations are imperfect, meaning that while the general trend is downward, individual data points might not fit the trend exactly (as in the chart above).
Negative correlations are commonly observed in various fields, such as finance or economics, where there's typically a negative correlation between the supply of a product and its price. As supply increases, prices tend to fall, and vice versa.
A demand curve is a good example of an often-used chart that has a negative or inverse correlation.
Investopedia
Negative Correlation and the Correlation Coefficient
The
correlation coefficient
is how you'll typically get information about the correlations (negative or otherwise) between different things. It's given as a number ranging from -1.0 to +1.0. A coefficient of +1.0 is a perfect positive correlation, indicating that two assets move in perfect unison.
Meanwhile, a coefficient of -1.0 signifies a perfectly negative correlation, where the assets move in exactly opposite directions. When the coefficient is 0, there is no discernible relationship between the movements of the two assets.
For investors, these numbers can be quite meaningful since they can be used to manage and create portfolios and handle risk. A diversified portfolio often aims to include assets with low or negative correlations with each other. This strategy can help mitigate overall portfolio risk, as losses in one asset might be offset by gains in another.
However, like any tool in finance, the correlation coefficient has its limits. It only measures linear relationships and can be sensitive to outliers in the data. In addition, correlation doesn't imply causation, and historical correlations don't guarantee future results.
Important
The degree of correlation between two variables is not static but can move from positive to negative and vice versa over time.
Watching for Outliers
An outlier in financial data is an extreme value that significantly deviates from other observations in a dataset. These can occur because of exceptional market events, data errors, or genuinely unusual occurrences.
Suppose we're analyzing the correlation between the
S&P 500 index
and a tech stock over the past year, using daily returns. Most days, the stock moves similarly to the broader market, with returns ranging between -2% and +2%. However, one day the following occurs:
S&P 500 return: +0.5%
Tech stock return: +30%
This 30% jump in the tech stock could have come from unexpected news, like a major product breakthrough. This single day's outsized return will pull up the average return for the tech stock, potentially misrepresenting its typical relationship with the market.
Thus, if we calculate the correlation coefficient including this outlier, it would suggest a weaker correlation between the stock and the S&P 500 than actually exists on most trading days. More broadly, this means watching out for times when the data might not be representative of most trading situations.
Negative Correlation and Investing
For investors, negative correlation refers to the relationship between two assets whose prices tend to move in opposite directions. When one asset's value increases, the other tends to decrease, and vice versa. Taking advantage of inverse relationships can be a great way to manage risk and optimize portfolios.
Here are two major uses in finance and investing:
Managing risk and diversification
: By including negatively correlated assets in a portfolio, investors can reduce overall volatility. When one asset declines in value, the other may increase, helping to offset losses.
Hedging
: Investors often use negatively correlated assets as a hedge against potential losses in their core holdings.
Here are examples of assets traditionally said to be negatively correlated:
Stocks and bonds
: When stock prices fall, bond prices often rise as investors seek safer havens.
Gold and the U.S. dollar
: Gold prices frequently rise when the U.S. dollar weakens (as in the first half of the 2020s and late 1970s), and vice versa.
Defensive stocks and cyclical stocks
: Defensive stocks (e.g., utilities) often perform better when cyclical stocks (e.g., technology) struggle.
That said, while these are often said to be true, the significance of the correlation over time can change, so it's best to look at the data first before acting. Below, we've put together a correlation table comparing many of the major assets included in portfolios.
As you can see, there are positive correlations, but few that are negative, and only moderately so, at least when the asset classes are diversified within a class and compared.
Negative Correlation and Portfolio Diversification
Negative correlation is a key when constructing a portfolio. When found between sectors or assets from different locales, negative correlations can be used to create diversified portfolios that can better withstand market volatility, smoothing out portfolio returns over the long term.
The building of large and complex portfolios where the correlations are carefully balanced is called
strategic asset allocation
.
Consider the historically long-term negative correlation between stocks and bonds. Stocks generally outperform bonds during periods of strong economic performance, but as the economy slows down and the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy, bonds often outperform stocks.
In the chart above, bonds tend to have a moderately negative to neutral correlation with stocks.
Fast Fact
Equities and bonds generally have a negative correlation, but like other asset classes, correlation fluctuates, and these two assets become more and less correlated during certain circumstances.
Example: Constructing a Portfolio With Negative Correlations
Using the table of asset correlations above, let's see if we can construct a relatively well-balanced portfolio given the data about the relationship among the different assets. This is for informational purposes only.
After all, there are many more reasons for including certain assets and excluding others than their correlations. We would need better information about recent performance, as well as our
risk tolerance
, needs for liquidity, time horizon, and other details that are up to the individual investor and depend on what's happening in the present market. But doing so will help to demonstrate the concept.

Investopedia,World Trade Organization (WTO): What It Is and What It Does,"Close
What Is the World Trade Organization (WTO)?
The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international institution that oversees the rules for global trade among nations. It was created in 1995, superseding the 1947
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) that was created in the wake of World War II.
The WTO is based on agreements signed by a majority of the world’s trading nations. The main function of the organization is to help producers of goods and services as well as exporters and importers to protect and manage their businesses.
Comoros and Timor Leste were approved to become the 165th and 166th members at the 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 26, 2024.
1
Key Takeaways
The World Trade Organization (WTO) oversees global trade rules among nations and mediates disputes.
The WTO has been a force for globalization with both positive and negative effects.
Big businesses tend to support the WTO for its positive impact on international economic growth.
Skeptics see it as increasing the wealth gap and hurting local workers and communities.
Understanding the World Trade Organization (WTO)
The WTO is essentially an
alternative dispute or mediation entity
that upholds the international rules of trade among nations. The organization provides a platform that allows member governments to negotiate and resolve trade issues with other members. The WTO’s main focus is to provide open lines of communication concerning trade among its members.
The WTO has lowered trade barriers and increased trade among member countries. It has also maintained trade barriers when it makes sense to do so in the global context. The WTO attempts to mediate between nations to benefit the global economy.
2
The WTO offers to interpret the agreement in case of a future dispute when negotiations are complete and an agreement is in place. All WTO agreements include a settlement process that allows it to conduct neutral conflict resolution.
2
WTO Leadership
The WTO’s General Council selected two-time Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as its director-general on Feb. 15, 2021. She's the first woman and the first African to be selected for the role. She took office on March 1, 2021 for a four-year term that will end Aug. 31, 2025. She's been reappointed for a second four-year term that will begin Sept. 1, 2025.
3
No negotiation, mediation, or resolution would be possible without the foundational WTO agreements. These agreements set the legal ground rules for
international commerce
that the WTO oversees. They bind a country’s government to a set of constraints that must be observed when setting future trade policies.
4
The agreements protect producers, importers, and exporters while encouraging world governments to meet specific social and environmental standards.
1
Important
The U.S. relationship with the WTO has turned cool. The feeling is that the WTO isn't doing enough to counteract China's unfair trade practices.
5
Advantages and Disadvantages of the WTO
The history of international trade has been a battle between protectionism and free trade. The WTO has fueled globalization with both positive and adverse effects. The organization’s efforts have increased
global trade
expansion but there are side effects to globalization including a negative impact on local communities and human rights.
6
Proponents of the WTO and particularly multinational corporations believe that the organization is beneficial to business. They see the stimulation of free trade and a decline in trade disputes as beneficial to the global economy.
Skeptics believe that the WTO
undermines the principles
of organic democracy and widens the international wealth gap. They point to the decline in domestic industries and increasing foreign influence as negative impacts on the world economy.
President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw from the WTO as part of his broader attempts to renegotiate U.S. international trade deals during his first term. He called it a “disaster.” A U.S. withdrawal from the WTO could have disrupted trillions of dollars in global trade. He didn’t withdraw the U.S. from the WTO during his time in office, however.
7
Why Is the World Trade Organization Important?
The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the body that keeps global trade running smoothly. It oversees the rules and mediates disputes among its member nations. It has 166 member nations as of 2025.
1
What Are the Main Functions of the World Trade Organization?
The World Trade Organization (WTO) administers trade agreements made among its member nations. It also mediates any trade disputes that arise.
8
Is the U.S. a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO)?
The U.S. has been a member of the WTO since 1995. It signed its General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948.
President Bill Clinton facilitated the acceptance of China into the WTO in 1999. The impact on China and the world continues to be debated.
9
The Bottom Line
The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created in 1995. It’s based on agreements that are signed by most of the world’s trading nations. Its goal is to assist and protect producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers. It has its champions but it has some critics as well.
President Trump threatened to withdraw from the WTO during his first term, calling it a “disaster.” Proponents applaud its positive impact on international economic growth.

Definition
Economics studies how societies manage scarce resources to produce, distribute, and consume goods and services. It is a social science.
What Is Economics?
Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The study of economics is primarily concerned with analyzing the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make to allocate limited resources.
Economics has ramifications on a wide range of other fields, including politics, psychology, business, and law.
Key Takeaways
Economics is the study of how people allocate scarce resources for production, distribution, and consumption, both individually and collectively.
The field of economics is connected with many others and has ramifications on them, such as politics, government, law, and business.
The two branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics.
Economics focuses on efficiency in production and exchange.
Gross domestic product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are two of the most widely used economic indicators.
Zoe Hansen / Investopedia
Understanding Economics
Assuming humans have unlimited wants within a world of limited means, economists analyze how resources are allocated for production, distribution, and consumption.
The study of
microeconomics
focuses on the choices of individuals and businesses, and
macroeconomics
concentrates on the behavior of the economy on an aggregate level.
One of the earliest recorded economists was eighth century B.C. Greek farmer and poet Hesiod, who wrote that labor, materials, and time needed to be allocated efficiently to overcome scarcity. The publication of
Adam Smith
’s 1776 book “An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” sparked the beginning of the current Western contemporary economic theories.

Microeconomics
Microeconomics studies how individual consumers and firms make decisions to allocate resources. Whether a single person, a household, or a business, economists may analyze how these entities respond to changes in price and why they demand what they do at particular price levels.
Microeconomics analyzes how and why goods are valued differently, how individuals make financial decisions, and how they trade, coordinate, and cooperate.
Within the dynamics of supply and demand, the costs of producing goods and services, and how labor is divided and allocated, microeconomics studies how businesses are organized and how individuals approach uncertainty and risk in their decision making.
Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. Its primary focus is recurrent
economic cycles
and broad economic growth and development.
It focuses on foreign trade, government fiscal and monetary policy, unemployment rates, the level of inflation, interest rates, the growth of total production output, and
business cycles
that result in expansions, booms, recessions, and depressions.
Using aggregate indicators, economists use macroeconomic models to help formulate economic policies and strategies.
What Is the Role of an Economist?
An
economist
studies the relationship between a society’s resources and its production or output, and their opinions help shape economic policies related to interest rates, tax laws, employment programs, international trade agreements, and corporate strategies.
Economists analyze economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to identify potential trends or make economic forecasts.
According to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
, 41% of all economists in the United States work for a federal or state agency. Economists are also employed as consultants, professors, by corporations, or as part of economic think tanks.
2
What Are Economic Indicators?
Economic indicators detail a country’s economic performance. Published periodically by governmental agencies or private organizations, economic indicators often have a considerable effect on stocks, employment, and international markets. They may predict future economic conditions that will move markets and guide investment decisions.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Gross domestic product (GDP)
is considered the broadest measure of a country’s economic performance. It calculates the total market value of all finished goods and services produced in a country in a given year. In the U.S., the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
also issues a regular report during the latter part of each month.
3
Many investors, analysts, and traders focus on the advance GDP report and the preliminary report, both issued before the final GDP figures because the GDP is considered a
lagging indicator
, meaning it can confirm a trend but can’t predict a trend.
GDPNow
The GDPNow forecasting model, used by the Federal Reserve, provides a “nowcast” of the official estimate before its release by estimating GDP growth using a methodology similar to the one used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
4
Retail Sales
Reported by the U.S.
Department of Commerce (DOC)
during the middle of each month, the
retail sales
report measures the total receipts, or dollar value, of all merchandise sold in stores.
5
Sampling retailers across the country acts as a proxy of consumer spending levels. Consumer spending represents more than two-thirds of GDP, proving useful to gauge the economy’s general direction.
6
Industrial Production
The
industrial production report
, released monthly by the Federal Reserve, reports changes in the production of factories, mines, and utilities in the U.S. One measure included in this report is the
capacity utilization rate
, which estimates the portion of productive capacity that is being used rather than standing idle in the economy. Capacity utilization in the range of 82% to 85% is considered “tight” and can increase the likelihood of price increases or supply shortages in the near term. Levels below 80% are interpreted as showing “slack” in the economy, which may increase the likelihood of a
recession
.
7
Employment Data
The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases employment data in a report called the
nonfarm payrolls
on the first Friday of each month.
8
Sharp increases in employment indicate prosperous economic growth, and potential contractions may be imminent if significant decreases occur. These are generalizations, however, and it’s important to consider the current position of the economy.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
The
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
, also issued by the BLS, measures the level of retail price changes and the costs that consumers pay, and is the benchmark for measuring
inflation
. Using a
basket
that is representative of the goods and services in the economy, the CPI compares the price changes month after month and year after year.
9
This report is an important economic indicator, and its release can increase volatility in equity, fixed-income, and forex markets. Greater-than-expected price increases are considered a sign of inflation, which will likely cause the underlying currency to depreciate.
Economic Systems
Five economic systems illustrate historical practices used to allocate resources to meet the needs of the individual and society.
Primitivism
In primitive agrarian societies, individuals produced necessities from building dwellings, growing crops, and hunting game at the household or tribal level.
Feudalism
A political and economic system of Europe from the ninth to 15th centuries, feudalism was defined by the lords who held land and leased it to peasants for production, who received a promise of safety and security from the lord.
Capitalism
With the advent of the Industrial Revolution,
capitalism
emerged and is defined as a system of production where business owners organize resources, including tools, workers, and raw materials, to produce goods for market consumption and earn profits. Supply and demand set prices in markets in a way that can serve the best interests of society.
Socialism
Socialism
is a form of a cooperative production economy. Economic socialism is a system of production in which there is limited or hybrid private ownership of the means of production. Prices, profits, and losses are not the determining factors used to establish who engages in the production, what to produce, and how to produce it.
Communism
Communism
holds that all economic activity is centralized through the coordination of state-sponsored
central planners
with common ownership of production and distribution.
Schools of Economic Theory
Many economic theories have evolved as societies and markets have grown and changed. However, three disciplines of economics—neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian—have influenced modern society.
The principles of
neoclassical economics
are often used as a framework to illustrate the virtues of capitalism, including the tendency of market prices to reach equilibrium as the volume of supply and demand changes. The optimal valuation of resources emerges from the forces of individual desire and scarcity.
John Maynard Keynes developed the theory of
Keynesian economics
during the Great Depression. Arguing against neoclassical theory, Keynes showed that restrained markets and government intervention in markets create a stable and equitable economic system. He advocated for a monetary policy designed to boost demand and investor confidence during economic downturns.
Marxian economics is defined in Karl Marx’s work “Das Kapital.”
Marxian economics
is a rejection of the
classical view of economics, arguing against the idea that the free market—an economic system determined by supply and deman",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp

What Is Goodwill?
Goodwill in business is an
intangible asset
that's recorded when one company is purchased by another. It's the portion of the purchase price that's higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process.
This difference is due to issues such as the value of a company’s name, brand reputation, loyal customer base, solid customer service, good employee relations, and proprietary technology. Goodwill represents a value that can give the acquiring company a competitive advantage. It's one of the reasons that one company may pay a premium for another.
Key Takeaways
Goodwill is an intangible asset that accounts for the excess purchase price of another company.
Goodwill includes proprietary or intellectual property, brand recognition, and other aspects of a company that are valuable but not easily quantifiable.
It's calculated by taking the purchase price of a company and subtracting the difference between the fair market value of the assets and liabilities.
Companies are required to review
the value of goodwill on their financial statements at least once a year and record any impairments.
Goodwill has an indefinite life. Most
other intangible assets have a finite
useful life.
Investopedia / Lara Antal
Understanding Goodwill
The value of goodwill typically comes into play when one company acquires another. A company's tangible value is the fair value of its net assets but the purchasing company may pay more than this price for the target company. This difference is usually due to the value of the target’s goodwill.
Fast Fact
A company gains negative goodwill, also known as badwill, if the acquiring company pays less than the target’s book value. It purchased the company at a bargain in a distress sale.
Goodwill is recorded as an intangible asset on the acquiring company's balance sheet under the long-term
assets account
. It's considered to be an intangible or non-current asset because it's not a physical asset such as buildings or equipment.
Companies are required under
generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to evaluate the value of goodwill on their financial statements at least once a year and record any impairments.

Important
Goodwill isn't the same as other intangible assets. It's the premium paid over fair value during a transaction and it can't be bought or sold independently. Other intangible assets such as licenses or patents can be. Goodwill has an indefinite life. Other intangibles have a finite useful life.
Goodwill Impairments
Accounting goodwill involves the
impairment
of assets that occurs when the market value of an asset drops below
historical cost
. This can occur as the result of an adverse event such as:
Declining cash flows
Increased competitive environment
Economic depression
The company must impair or do a
write-down
on the value of the asset on the balance sheet if a company assesses that acquired net assets fall below the book value or if the amount of goodwill was overstated. The impairment expense is calculated as the difference between the current market value and the purchase price of the intangible asset.
The impairment results in a decrease in the goodwill account on the balance sheet. The expense is also recognized as a loss on the income statement. This directly reduces net income for the year.
Earnings per share
(EPS) and the company's stock price are also negatively affected.
Impairment Tests
Companies assess whether an impairment exists by performing an impairment test on an intangible asset. The two commonly used methods for testing impairments are the income approach and the market approach.
Income approach
: Estimated future cash flows are discounted to the present value.
Market approach
: Assets and liabilities of similar companies operating in the same industry are analyzed.
Calculating Goodwill
The process for calculating goodwill is fairly straightforward in principle but it can be complex in practice. You can determine goodwill with a simple formula by taking the purchase price of a company and subtracting the net
fair market value
of identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill
=
P
−
(
A
−
L
)
where:
P
=
Purchase price of the target company
A
=
Fair market value of assets
L
=
Fair market value of liabilities
\begin{aligned}&\text{Goodwill} = \text{P} - ( \text{ A } - \text { L } ) \\&\textbf{where:} \\&\text{P} = \text{Purchase price of the target company} \\&\text{A} = \text{Fair market value of assets} \\&\text{L} = \text{Fair market value of liabilities} \\\end{aligned}
​
Goodwill
=
P
−
(
A
−
L
)
where:
P
=
Purchase price of the target company
A
=
Fair market value of assets
L
=
Fair market value of liabilities
​
Accountants
use competing approaches in calculating goodwill.
Goodwill involves factoring in estimates of future cash flows and other considerations that aren't known at the time of the acquisition. This may not normally be a major issue but it can become significant when accountants look for ways to compare reported assets or net income between companies. Some of them may have acquired other firms and some may not have.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets standards for GAAP rules, was considering a change to how goodwill impairment is calculated. FASB was considering reverting to an older method called ""goodwill
amortization
"" due to the subjectivity of goodwill impairment and the cost of testing it. This method would have reduced the value of goodwill annually over several years but the project was set aside in 2022 and the older method was retained.
2
Limitations of Goodwill
Goodwill is difficult to price and negative goodwill can occur when an acquirer purchases a company for less than its fair market value. This usually happens when the target company can't or won't negotiate a fair price for its acquisition.
Negative goodwill is usually seen in
distressed sales
and is recorded as income on the acquirer's income statement.
There's also the risk that a previously successful company could face
insolvency
. The goodwill the company previously enjoyed has no resale value at the point of insolvency. Investors deduct goodwill from their determinations of residual equity when this happens.
Example of Goodwill
The premium paid for the acquisition is $3 billion ($15 billion - $12 billion) if the fair value of Company ABC's assets minus liabilities is $12 billion and a company purchases Company ABC for $15 billion. This $3 billion will be included on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill.
Consider the T-Mobile and Sprint merger announced in early 2018 for a real-life example.
3
The deal was valued at $35.85 billion as of March 31, 2018, per an S-4 filing.
4
The fair value of the assets was $78.34 billion and the fair value of the liabilities was $45.56 billion.
The difference between the assets and liabilities is $32.78 billion so goodwill for the deal would be recognized as $3.07 billion ($35.85 billion - $32.78 billion), the amount over the difference between the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
5
How Is Goodwill Different From Other Assets?
Goodwill is an intangible asset that's created when one company acquires another company for a price greater than its net asset value. It's shown on the company's
balance sheet
like other assets.
But goodwill isn't amortized or depreciated, unlike other assets that have a discernible useful life. It's periodically tested for goodwill impairment instead. The value of goodwill must be written off, reducing the company’s earnings, if the goodwill is thought to be impaired.
How Is Goodwill Used in Investing?
Evaluating goodwill is a challenging but critical skill for many investors. It can be difficult to tell whether the goodwill claimed on a balance sheet is justified.
Investors should scrutinize what's behind its stated goodwill when they're analyzing a company’s balance sheet. The answer should determine whether that goodwill may have to be written off in the future.
The opposite can also occur in some cases with investors believing that the true value of a company’s goodwill is greater than what's stated on its balance sheet.

What Is a Normal Distribution?
Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a
probability distribution
that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution appears as a ""
bell curve
"" when graphed.
Key Takeaways
The normal distribution is the proper term for a probability bell curve.
In a normal distribution, the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1. It has zero skew and a kurtosis of 3.
Normal distributions are symmetrical, but not all symmetrical distributions are normal.
Investopedia / Lara Antal
Properties of Normal Distribution
The normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis. The standard
normal distribution has two parameters
: the mean and the standard deviation. In a normal distribution,
mean
(average),
median
(midpoint), and
mode
(most frequent observation) are equal. These values represent the peak or highest point. The distribution then falls symmetrically around the mean, the width of which is defined by the
standard deviation
.
The normal distribution model is key to the
Central Limit Theorem
(CLT) which states that averages calculated from independent, identically distributed random variables have approximately normal distributions, regardless of the type of distribution from which the variables are sampled.
1
The normal distribution is one type of
symmetrical distribution
. Symmetrical distributions occur when a dividing line produces two mirror images. Not all symmetrical distributions are normal since some data could appear as two humps or a series of hills in addition to the bell curve that indicates a normal distribution.
Observations
The Empirical Rule
For all normal distributions, 68.2% of the observations will appear within plus or minus one standard deviation of the mean; 95.4% will fall within +/- two standard deviations; and 99.7% within +/- three standard deviations.

This fact is sometimes called the ""empirical rule,"" a heuristic that describes where most of the data in a normal distribution will appear. Data falling outside three standard deviations (""3-sigma"") would signify rare occurrences.
Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang
Skewness
Skewness measures the degree of symmetry of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric and has a
skewness
of zero. If the distribution of a data set instead has a skewness less than zero, or negative skewness (left-skewness), then the left tail of the distribution is longer than the right tail; positive skewness (right-skewness) implies that the right tail of the distribution is longer than the left.
Kurtosis
Kurtosis
measures the thickness of the tail ends of a distribution to the tails of a distribution. The normal distribution has a
kurtosis
equal to 3.0. Distributions with larger kurtosis greater than 3.0 exhibit tail data exceeding the tails of the normal distribution (e.g., five or more standard deviations from the mean).
This
excess kurtosis
is known in statistics as
leptokurtic
, but is more colloquially known as ""fat tails."" The occurrence of fat tails in financial markets describes what is known as
tail risk
. Distributions with low kurtosis less than 3.0 (
platykurtic
) exhibit tails that are generally less extreme (""skinnier"") than the tails of the normal distribution.
Kurtosis describes the different kinds of peaks that probability distributions can have.
C.K.Taylor
Formula
The normal distribution follows the following formula. Note that only the values of the mean (μ ) and standard deviation (σ) are necessary
Normal Distribution Formula.
where:
x
= value of the variable or data being examined and f(x) the probability function
μ = the mean
σ = the standard deviation
How Normal Distribution Is Used in Finance
The assumption of a normal distribution is applied to asset prices and
price action
. Traders may plot price points to fit recent price action into a normal distribution. The further price action moves from the mean, in this case, the greater the likelihood that an asset is being over or undervalued. Traders can use the standard deviations to suggest potential trades. This type of trading is generally done on very short time frames as larger timescales make it much harder to pick entry and exit points.
Similarly, many statistical theories attempt to
model asset prices
and assume they follow a normal distribution. In reality, price distributions tend to have fat tails and, therefore, have kurtosis greater than three. Such assets have had price movements greater than three standard deviations beyond the mean more often than expected under the assumption of a normal distribution. Even if an asset has gone through a long period where it fits a normal distribution, there is no guarantee that the past performance truly informs the future.
Example of a Normal Distribution
Many naturally occurring phenomena appear to be normally distributed. For example, the average height of a human is roughly 175 cm (5' 9""), counting both males and females.
As the chart below shows, most people conform to that average. Taller and shorter people exist with decreasing frequency in the population. According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of all people will fall with +/- three standard deviations of the mean, or between 154 cm (5' 0"") and 196 cm (6' 5""). Those taller and shorter than this would be rare (just 0.15% of the population each).
What Is Meant By the Normal Distribution?
The normal distribution describes a symmetrical plot of data around its mean value, where the width of the curve is defined by the standard deviation. It is visually depicted as the ""bell curve.""
Why Is the Normal Distribution Called ""Normal?""
The normal distribution is technically known as the Gaussian distribution, however, it took on the terminology ""normal"" following scientific publications in the 19
th
century showing that many natural phenomena appeared to ""deviate normally"" from the mean. This idea of ""normal variability"" was made popular as the ""normal curve"" by the naturalist Sir Francis Galton in his 1889 work,
Natural Inheritance.
2
What Are the Limitations of the Normal Distribution in Finance?
Although normal distribution is a statistical concept, its applications in finance can be limited because financial phenomena—such as expected stock-market returns—do not fall neatly within a normal distribution. Prices tend to follow more of a
log-normal distribution
, right-skewed and with fatter tails. Therefore, relying too heavily on a bell curve when making predictions can lead to unreliable results. Although most analysts are well aware of this limitation, it is relatively difficult to overcome this shortcoming because it is often unclear which statistical distribution to use as an alternative.
The Bottom Line
Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that appears as a ""bell curve"" when graphed. The normal distribution describes a symmetrical plot of data around its mean value, where the width of the curve is defined by the standard deviation.

Definition
A transaction where an investor sells a losing security and purchases a similar one 30 days before or after the sale to try and reduce their overall tax liability.
What Is a Wash Sale?
A wash sale is a transaction in which an investor sells or trades a security at a loss and purchases “a substantially similar one” 30 days before or 30 days after the sale.
1
This is a rule enacted by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
to prevent investors from using capital losses to their advantage at tax time.
The wash sale rule applies to stocks, contracts, options, and all other types of securities and trading.
Key Takeaways
A wash sale occurs when an investor purchases a security 30 days before or 30 days after selling an identical or similar security.
The IRS instituted the wash sale rule to prevent taxpayers from using the practice to reduce their tax liability.
Investors who sell a security at a loss cannot claim it if they have purchased the same or a similar security within 30 days (before or after) the sale.
Theresa Chiechi / Investopedia
Understanding Wash Sales
Many countries’ tax laws allow
investors
to claim a specific amount of capital losses on their taxes as an income reduction. In the United States, you can claim up to $3,000 or your total net loss, whichever is less. If you have more than $3,000 in capital losses, you can carry the additional loss forward into the following years.
2
The ability to carry losses led to investors inventing a loophole where they would plan to sell a losing security and buy a substantially similar one again within a short period. This allowed them to claim a
capital loss
and use that loss to mitigate tax liabilities.
To prevent the abuse of this incentive, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) instituted the wash sale rule in the U.S. (In the United Kingdom, the practice is known as bed-and-breakfasting, and the tax rules in the U.K. have an implementation similar to the wash sale rule). The law states that if an investor buys a security within 30 days before or after selling it, any losses made from that sale cannot be counted against reported
income
. This effectively removes the incentive to do a short-term wash sale.

How It Works
Generally, a wash sale has three parts.
An investor notices they are in a losing position, so they close it by selling the stock or exiting a trading position.
The sale allows them to take a loss that they can legally claim on their tax returns as a reduction of their earnings for that year, which reduces their total
tax liability
.
The investor will look to purchase the security
at or below the price
at which they sold it—if the purchase occurred 30 days before or after the sale, it is considered a wash sale, and the loss cannot be claimed.
Important
Day traders, especially pattern day traders—those who execute more than four day trades over a five-day period in a margin account—may encounter wash sales regularly. The wash sale rule still applies to these traders. The tax implications for day traders are complex, so it’s best to consult a tax professional if you’re day trading.
Wash Sale Example
Assume an investor has a $15,000 capital gain from the sale of ABC stock. They fall in the highest
tax bracket
and must pay a 20% capital gains tax of $3,000. But let’s say they sold XYZ security for a loss of $7,000. The net capital gain for tax purposes would be $15,000 - $7,000 = $8,000, which means they’ll have to pay only $1,600 in
capital gains tax
. Notice how the realized loss on XYZ reduces the gain on ABC, reducing the investor’s tax bill.
However, if the investor repurchases XYZ stock—or a stock
substantially identical
to XYZ—within 30 days of the sale, the above transaction is counted as a wash sale, and the loss is not allowed to offset any gains.
Special Considerations
The IRS does not ordinarily consider bonds and preferred stock of an issuing company to be substantially identical to the company’s common stock. However, there may be circumstances where preferred stock, for example, may be considered substantially identical to the common stock.
This would be the case if the preferred stock is convertible into common stock without any restriction, has the same
voting rights
as the common stock, and trades at a price close to the conversion ratio.
Fast Fact
Per Revenue Ruling 2008-5, individual retirement account (IRA) transactions can also trigger the wash sale rule. If shares are sold in a non-retirement account, and substantially identical shares are purchased in an IRA within 30 days, the investor cannot claim tax losses for the sale, nor is the basis in the individual’s IRA increased.
3
Reporting a Wash Sale Loss
The good news is that any loss realized on a wash sale is not entirely lost. Instead, the loss can be applied to the
cost basis
of the most recently purchased substantially identical security. Not only does this addition increase the cost basis of the purchased securities, but it also reduces the size of any future taxable gains as a result.
Thus, the investor still receives credit for those losses, but at a later time. Also, the holding period of the wash sale securities is added to the holding period of the repurchased securities, which increases an investor’s odds of qualifying for the 15% favorable tax rate on long-term capital gains.
Tip
Tax-loss harvesting
can inadvertently lead to wash sales if not carefully managed. Tax-loss harvesting is the strategy of selling securities at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability elsewhere and then buying back a replacement security to maintain the existing portfolio’s overall composition. The objective is to lower your overall tax bill by realizing those losses. However, if you’re not careful about how you replace the securities you’ve sold, you can trigger the wash sale rule. To avoid this, investors often look for alternative investments that are similar but not substantially identical.
What Triggers the Wash Sale Rule?
The wash sale rule is triggered if, 30 days before or 30 days after you sell a security at a loss, you buy back a substantially similar security.
Is a Wash Sale Window 30 or 60 Days?
A wash sale has a 60-day window, from 30 days before the sale to 30 days after the sale.
Is It OK to Have Wash Sales?
It isn’t illegal to buy a substantially similar security 30 days before or after selling one, but you’re not allowed to deduct any losses incurred from the sale and purchase to offset your taxable income.
The Bottom Line
A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and then purchases the same or a substantially similar security within 30 days, before or after the transaction. This rule is designed to prevent investors from claiming capital losses as tax deductions if they reenter a similar position too quickly. Wash sales are not illegal but have negative tax implications: Losses from such sales cannot be used to offset gains in the same
tax year
.
However, these losses can be added to the cost basis of the newly purchased security, affecting future gains. This rule is relevant to all types of securities and trading, and it’s particularly significant for day traders and investors looking to use capital losses to mitigate tax liabilities. Understanding and navigating the wash sale rule is crucial for effective tax planning and investment strategy.

Investopedia,"30-Year Treasury: Meaning, History, Examples","Close
What Is the 30-Year Treasury?
The 30-Year Treasury is a U.S. Treasury debt obligation that has a maturity of 30 years. The 30-year Treasury used to be the
bellwether
U.S. bond but now most consider the 10-year Treasury to be the benchmark.
Key Takeaways
30-year Treasuries are bonds issued by the U.S. government and have a maturity of 30 years.
Other securities issued by the U.S. government include Treasury bills, notes, and Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
30-year Treasuries pay interest semiannually until they mature and at maturity pay the face value of the bond.
Understanding the 30-Year Treasury
The U.S. government borrows money from investors by issuing debt securities through its Treasury department. Debt instruments that can be purchased from the government include
Treasury bills
(T-bills), notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). T-bills are
marketable securities
issued for terms of less than a year, and
Treasury notes
are issued with maturities from two to 10 years.
TIPS
are marketable securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). When there is inflation, the principal increases. When deflation sets in, the principal decreases.
1
U.S. Treasury securities with longer-term maturities can be purchased as U.S. Savings bonds or Treasury bonds.
Special Considerations
Treasury bonds
are long-term debt securities issued with a maturity of 20 years or 30 years from the issue date. These marketable securities pay interest semi-annually, or every six months until they mature. At maturity, the investor is paid the
face value
of the bond. The 30-year Treasury will generally pay a higher interest rate than shorter Treasuries to compensate for the additional risks inherent in the longer maturity. However, when compared to other bonds, Treasuries are relatively safe because they are backed by the U.S. government.
2
The price and interest rate of the 30-year Treasury bond is determined at an
auction
where it is set at either par, premium, or
discount to par
. If the
yield to maturity
(YTM) is greater than the interest rate, the price of the bond will be issued at a discount. If the YTM is equal to the interest rate, the price will be equal to par. Finally, if the YTM is less than the interest rate, the Treasury bond price will be sold
at a premium
to par. In a single auction, a bidder can buy up to $5 million in bonds by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding. In addition, the bonds are sold in increments of $100 and the minimum purchase is $100.
3
30-Year Treasury vs. Savings Bonds
U.S. Savings bonds
, specifically,
Series EE Savings bonds
, are non-marketable securities that earn interest for 30 years. Interest isn’t paid out periodically. Instead, interest accumulates, and the investor receives everything when they redeem the savings bond. The bond can be redeemed after one year, but if they are sold before five years from the purchase date, the investor will lose the last three months' interest.
4
For example, an investor who sells the Savings bond after 24 months will only receive interest for 21 months.
Because the U.S. is seen as a very low-risk borrower, many investors see 30-year Treasury interest rates as indicative of the state of the wider bond market. Normally, the interest rate decreases with greater demand for 30-year Treasury securities and rises with lower demand. The S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Current 30-Year Index is a one-security index comprising the most recently issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. It is a market value-weighted index that seeks to measure the performance of the Treasury bond market.

What Does Not for Profit Mean?
Not-for-profit organizations do not earn profits for their owners. All of the money earned by or donated to a not-for-profit organization is used in pursuing the organization’s objectives and keeping it running. Income is not distributed to the group’s members, directors, or officers. Examples include homeowners associations, fraternities, and sororities.
Key Takeaways
In a not-for-profit organization, all funds must be used for pursuing the group’s objectives and paying its running costs. Funds never go to the group’s members, directors, or officers.
Some not-for-profit organizations resemble for-profit organizations in their use of management techniques to run their enterprises.
Every not-for-profit organization has to maintain compliance with the state agency that regulates charitable organizations where it is based.
Charitable Purposes of a Not-for-Profit Organization
Not-for-profit organizations can be social clubs that exist to serve their members, as well as social welfare organizations, civic leagues, labor organizations, and business leagues. These groups are

Not-for-profit organizations may engage in work to provide basic necessities to those in need.
Provide Education.
Not-for-profit organizations may work to increase people's knowledge or skillsets.
Advance Religion.
Not-for-profit organizations may establish, maintain, or follow a religious faith.
Provide Community Benefits.
Not-for-profit organizations may provide various resources for the betterment of the community.
Activities of Not-for-Profit Organizations
Broadly speaking, not-for-profit organizations are responsible for three activities: fundraising, program operations, and administrative management.
Fundraising activities range from major public events to smaller, private gatherings. Not-for-profit organizations may also solicit direct donations, sell products, or rely on major gifts.
Typically, most of the fundraised funds go towards the not-for-profit organization's programming. This programming supports the mission it was created to serve. Funds are also used to pay for administrative expenses, like
bookkeeping
.
Not-for-Profit Organizations and Taxes
Thanks to their tax-exempt status, not-for-profit organizations are
not subject to most forms of taxation
, including sales tax and property taxes.
However, in most cases, only donations made to nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations are
tax-deductible
. Not-for-profit organizations aren't necessarily 501(c)(3)s—that is, they can be social organizations without a charitable purpose—so even if they're tax-exempt, donations might not be tax-deductible.
For example, if a church is established as a not-for-profit organization, it does not pay property taxes on the house of worship that it owns. Similarly, if a not-for-profit charity accepts clothing donations, sells the clothing, and uses the money for its charitable purposes, it does not pay property tax on the building that it uses as its store.
However, not-for-profit organizations must remit
payroll taxes
on behalf of their employees.
2
Similarly, the employees and directors who receive income from a not-for-profit organization must report the income to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
.
For Profit vs. Not for Profit
Aside from the distinguishing feature that a not-for-profit organization does not distribute profits to its owners, many nonprofits have much in common with for-profit organizations.
For example, while some not-for-profit organizations use only volunteer labor, many have a staff of paid employees, managers, and directors. In addition, management techniques honed in the for-profit world often work well in not-for-profit organizations, too.
However, while
for-profit businesses can engage in a huge range of activities
, not-for-profit businesses must operate exclusively as a charity or for scientific, religious, or public safety purposes.
3
Additionally, not-for-profit organizations may exist to collect income to dispense to other qualifying charities.
4
Important
Even tax-exempt not-for-profit organizations are required to remit payroll taxes on behalf of their employees, who also must report the income to the IRS.
Nonprofit vs. Not for Profit
Both nonprofit organizations and not-for-profit organizations operate entities that don't distribute profits to their owners. All funds must go back into the organization—that is, funds must be spent either on supporting the organization's mission and programmatic goals or used to support administrative costs.
Both nonprofit organizations and not-for-profit organizations are often overseen by a board of directors.
However, while nonprofits must offer a broad public benefit, not-for-profit organizations may not. Instead, not-for-profit organizations may exist to serve the best interest for a select few. For example, private sports clubs are typically not-for-profit organizations.
In addition, nonprofits may have a different legal structure than not-for-profit organizations.
Can a Not-for-Profit Organization Make Money?
Yes, a not-for-profit organization can make money in the sense that it can seek donations to fund its operations and may end up with a surplus of money in its coffers at the end of the
fiscal year
. However, all of that money must be used to fund the organization’s operations. It cannot be distributed to the organization’s owners as profit.
Are All Nonprofits 501(c)(3) Organizations?
No, not all nonprofits are 501(c)(3) organizations. The 501(c)(3) designation made by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is only for charitable organizations. Generally, organizations existing for scientific, religious, or public safety purposes can be tax-exempt but not have 501(c)(3) status.
5
Are Donations to All Not-for-Profit Organizations Tax-Deductible?
No. Only donations made to organizations that have a charitable purpose are allowed as itemized tax deductions by the IRS. So a donation to a sports club, for example, may not be tax-deductible.
6
The Bottom Line
Though not-for-profit organizations exist to better the world, their purview is typically smaller than the work of nonprofit organizations—think homeowners associations and sports clubs, rather than the American Red Cross. However, not-for-profit organizations may still receive favorable tax treatment through the IRS—that is, they may be tax-exempt. Any surplus funds (profits) must go to the organization to support its operations—not to its owners.

Definition
Dividends are periodic payments made to shareholders from corporate profits.
What Are Dividends?
Dividends are a percentage of a company's earnings paid to its shareholders as their share of the profits. Dividends are generally paid quarterly, with the amount decided by the board of directors based on the company's most recent earnings.
Dividends may be paid in cash or additional shares. When a company announces a dividend, it also announces the payment date on which the dividend will be paid into the shareholders' accounts.
Key Takeaways
A dividend is a distribution of a company's earnings to eligible shareholders.
Dividend payments and amounts are determined by the company's board of directors.
Many companies do not pay dividends and instead retain their earnings to be invested back into the company.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Dividends
A dividend is a reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company, and it is usually paid out of the company's net profits. Some companies continue to make dividend payments even when their profits don't justify the expense. A steady track record of paying dividends makes stocks more attractive to investors. Various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also pay dividends.
Dividends (for stocks) must be approved by shareholders; for funds, the fund managers award dividends based on the fund's net asset value and whether the fund receives dividends. Although cash dividends are common, dividends can also be issued as shares of stock.
Fast Fact
A stock's dividend yield is the dividend paid per share and is expressed as a percentage of the company's share price, such as 2.5%.
Who Gets Dividends and How
Common stock shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive a distribution as long as they own the stock before the
ex-dividend date
. This is essentially a cutoff date for assigning the dividend payment when shares change hands.

Dividends are paid on a schedule set by the board. They may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. For example, Walmart Inc. (WMT) and Unilever (UL) make regular quarterly dividend payments.
1
2
Companies can also issue non-recurring special dividends, either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend. For example, United Bancorp Inc. declared a $0.15 per share special dividend on Feb. 23, 2023.
3
Fast Fact
Not all companies pay dividends to the owners of common shares, but owners of
preferred shares
are guaranteed a set dividend payment.
Dividend-Paying Companies
Larger, established companies with predictable profits are often the best dividend payers. Companies within the following industry sectors maintain a regular record of dividend payments:
Basic materials
Oil and gas
Banks and financial
Healthcare and pharmaceuticals
Utilities
Companies structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs) and real estate investment trusts (REITS) are required to make specified distributions to their shareholders.
4
5
Funds may also issue regular dividend payments as stated in their investment objectives.
Who Doesn't Pay a Dividend?
Young, fast-growing companies such as those in the technology and biotechnology sectors may not pay regular dividends since they may be in the early stages of development and retain all of their earnings for research and development, business expansion, and operational activities.
Investors tend to forgive the lack of a dividend if the company's stock price is growing rapidly.
Not surprisingly, once a company begins paying dividends, it finds it difficult to reduce or suspend the payments. This is generally viewed by investors as a sign of falling profits, not to mention a loss of income.
Important Dividend Dates
Dividend payments follow a chronological order of events, and the associated dates are important in determining which shareholders qualify to receive the dividend payment:
Announcement date
: Dividends are announced by company management on the announcement date (or declaration date) and must be approved by the shareholders before they can be paid.
Ex-dividend date
: The date on which the dividend eligibility expires is called the ex-dividend date or simply the ex-date. For instance, if a stock has an ex-date of Monday, May 5, shareholders who buy the stock on or after that day will NOT qualify to receive the dividend. Shareholders who own the stock one business day prior to the ex-date, on Friday, May 2, or earlier, qualify for the distribution.
Record date
: The record date is the cutoff date, established by the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution.
Payment date
: The company issues the dividend payment on the
payment date
, which is when the money is credited to investors' accounts.
6
7
How Do Dividends Affect a Stock's Share Price?
A stock's share price may change to reflect a dividend payment.
For example, assume a company trading at $60 per share declares a $2 dividend. As the news becomes public, the share price may increase by $2 and hit $62.
The stock might trade at $63 one business day before the ex-dividend date. On the ex-dividend date, its price will likely fall below its previous price, such as $61, at the start of the trading session, because anyone buying on the ex-dividend date will not receive the dividend.
Why Do Companies Pay Dividends?
Many investors buy stocks for their dividends rather than their share price growth potential. Some extraordinarily successful companies like Coca-Cola Co. are prized more by investors for their steady dividends than for their potential price growth.
Dividends are often expected by shareholders as their share of the company's profits. Dividend payments reflect positively on a company and help maintain investors' trust.
A high-value dividend declaration can indicate that a company is doing well and has generated good profits. However, some may interpret it as an indication that the company does not have much going on in the way of new projects to generate better returns in the future. The company may appear to be using its cash to pay shareholders instead of reinvesting it into growth.
A company with a long history of dividend payments that declares a reduction or elimination of its dividend signals trouble. However, a dividend cut does not necessarily translate into bad news. The company's management may have a plan for investing the money in a high-return project that could magnify returns for shareholders in the long run.
Mutual Fund Dividends
Dividends paid by funds are different from dividends paid by companies. Funds employ the principle of
net asset value
(NAV), which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the price of the assets a fund has in its portfolio.
8
Regular dividend payments should not be misread as a stellar performance by the fund. For example, a bond-investing fund may pay monthly dividends because it receives monthly interest on its interest-bearing holdings and merely transfers the income from the interest fully or partially to the fund's investors.
A stock-investing fund pays dividends from the earnings received from the many stocks held in its portfolio, or by selling a certain share of stocks and distributing capital gains.
Are Dividends Irrelevant?
Economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued that a company's dividend policy is irrelevant and has no effect on its stock price or
cost of capital
.
A shareholder may be indifferent to a company's dividend policy, especially if the dividend is used to buy more shares. If a dividend payout is seen as inadequate, an investor can sell shares to generate cash.
In either case, the combination of the value of an investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain the same. Miller and Modigliani thus conclude that dividends are irrelevant, and investors shouldn't care about the firm's dividend policy because they can create their own synthetically.
9
This argument has done little to persuade the many investors who consider dividends an attractive investment incentive.
How to Buy Dividend-Paying Investments
Investors seeking dividend investments have several options, including stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
The dividend discount or
Gordon growth models
can help investors choose individual stocks. These techniques rely on anticipated future dividend streams to value shares.
To compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance, investors can use the dividend yield factor, which measures the dividend in terms of a percentage of the current market price of the company’s share.

What Is Laissez-Faire?
Laissez-faire is an economic theory dating back to the 18th century that opposes any government intervention in business affairs. The driving principle behind laissez-faire economics is that the less the
government
is involved in the
economy
, the better off business, and society as a whole, will be.
It is a French term that translates to “leave alone,” or more literally to “let you do.”
Laissez-faire economics is a key component of
free-market
capitalism.
Key Takeaways
Laissez-faire is an economic philosophy of free-market capitalism that opposes government intervention.
The theory of laissez-faire was developed by the French Physiocrats during the 18th century.
Laissez-faire advocates that economic success is inhibited when governments are involved in business and markets.
Later free-market economists built on the ideas of laissez-faire as a path to economic prosperity, though detractors have criticized it for promoting inequality.
Critics argue that markets do need a certain degree of government regulation and involvement.
Sydney Saporito / Investopedia
Understanding Laissez-Faire
The underlying beliefs that make up the fundamentals of laissez-faire economics include the idea that economic competition constitutes a “natural order” that rules the world. Because this natural self-regulation is the best type of regulation, laissez-faire
economists
argue that there is no need for business and industrial affairs to be complicated by
government intervention
.
As a result, they oppose any sort of federal involvement in the economy, which includes any type of legislation or oversight; they are against
minimum wages
, duties, trade restrictions, and
corporate taxes
. In fact, laissez-faire economists see such taxes as a penalty for production.

Important
Laissez-faire is often associated with libertarian views on the economy, where government plays an extremely limited role. In fact, one of the key characteristics of laissez-faire economics is that the government should only be involved with the following three functions:
Protecting the national borders via a standing army
Protecting private property rights and personal freedom via a police force and judiciary
Producing
public goods
that serve society, such as parks and libraries, that the market would not be incentivized to produce on its own
History of Laissez-Faire
Popularized in the mid-1700s, the doctrine of laissez-faire is one of the first articulated economic theories. It originated with a group known as the Physiocrats, who flourished in France from about 1756 to 1778.
1
These thinkers tried to apply scientific principles and methodology to the study of wealth and economic production.
These economists argued that a free market and free economic
competition
were extremely important to the health of a free society.
2
They believed the government should only intervene in the economy to preserve property, life, and individual freedom; otherwise, the natural, unchanging laws that govern market forces and economic processes—what later British economist
Adam Smith
dubbed the “
invisible hand
”—should be allowed to proceed unhindered.
Unfortunately, an early effort to test laissez-faire theories did not go well. As an experiment in 1774, Turgot, Louis XVI’s Controller-General of Finances, abolished all restraints on the heavily controlled grain industry, allowing imports and exports between provinces to operate as a free trade system. But when poor harvests caused scarcities, prices shot through the roof; merchants ended up hoarding supplies or selling grain in strategic areas, even outside the country for better profit, while thousands of French citizens starved. Riots ensued for several months. In the middle of 1775, order was restored, and with it, government controls over the grain market.
3
Despite this inauspicious start, laissez-faire practices, developed further by such British economists as Smith and
David Ricardo
, ruled during the
Industrial Revolution
of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. And, as its detractors noted, it resulted in unsafe working conditions and large wealth gaps.
Fast Fact
Only at the beginning of the 20th century did developed industrialized nations like the United States begin to implement significant government controls and regulations to protect workers from hazardous conditions and consumers from unfair business practices. However, it’s important to note that these policies were not intended to restrict business practices and competition.
Criticism of Laissez-Faire
Laissez-faire advocates argue that if individuals serve their own interests first, societal benefits will follow. One of the chief criticisms of laissez-faire is that
capitalism
as a system has moral ambiguities built into it; it does not inherently protect the weakest in society.
As such, detractors feel laissez-faire actually leads to poverty and economic imbalances. The idea of letting an economic system run without regulation or correction in effect dismisses or further victimizes those most in need of assistance, they say.
The 20th-century British economist
John Maynard Keynes
was a prominent critic of laissez-faire economics, and he argued that the question of market solutions vs. government intervention needed to be decided on a case-by-case basis.
4
Pros and Cons of Laissez-Faire
Pros
Reduces government involvement in business, which is thought to be inefficient and stifling
Encourages self-responsibility and innovation
Promotes free markets and competition
Cons
Lack of regulations can harm consumers and the environment
Can generate negative externalities
Competition naturally leads to wealth inequality
May incentivize bad actors
What Does ‘Laissez-Faire’ Mean Literally?
Laissez-faire, in French, literally means “let you do.” Legend has it that the origins of the phrase “laissez-faire” in an economic context came from a 1681 meeting between the French finance minister Jean-Baptise Colbert and a businessman named Le Gendre. As the story goes, Colbert asked Le Gendre how best the government could help commerce, to which Le Gendre replied “
Laissez-nous faire
,” meaning “let us do.” The Physiocrats popularized the phrase, using it to name their core economic doctrine.
5
What Is an Example of Laissez-Faire?
An economy would follow the principles of laissez-faire if it followed an approach where the government was not at all involved in the workings of the economy, business, or markets. Instead, the free market would not only regulate prices but also discipline producers to remain good actors. In reality, such an economy does not exist. All economies, even in countries with highly libertarian values, have some degree of government regulation and intervention.
What Is Laissez-Faire Capitalism?
In laissez-faire capitalism, companies could operate with a pure profit motive and not have to worry about government regulation or taxation. This, of course, could create negative externalities and information asymmetries that can allow producers to behave as bad actors and get away with it. Proponents of laissez-faire say that costly and exhaustive regulation is not needed since the market would weed out such bad actors. In reality, however, bad actors may continue operating for a long while.
The Bottom Line
Laissez-faire refers to an economic theory opposed to government intervention in the market. A central element of free-market capitalism, laissez-faire posits that businesses and society as a whole are significantly better off without government involvement. The idea dates back to 18th century France, and is popular in countries with libertarian values in the present.

What Is Nominal?
Nominal is a common financial term with several different meanings. In the first, it means very small or far below the real value or cost. In finance, this adjective modifies words such as a fee or charge. A nominal fee is below the price of the service provided or presumably easy for a consumer to afford, or a fee that is small enough that it does not have any meaningful impact on one's finances. Nominal may also refer to a rate that's been unadjusted for inflation.
Key Takeaways
Nominal is a financial term that has several different contexts.
It can mean small or far below the real value or cost such as a nominal fee.
Nominal also refers to an unadjusted rate in value such as interest rates or GDP.
In finance, the
real interest
rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.
Types of Nominals
In finance and economics, nominal may also refer to an unadjusted rate or the change in value. When defining items like the gross domestic product (GDP) or interest rates, nominal points to a figure that is unadjusted for
seasonality
, inflation, interest
compounding
, and other modifiers. In this use, nominal shows the contrast to ""real"" economic statistics that do make such adjustments or modifications to results.
Because a nominal figure will deal with the unadjusted value of a study, it is best not to use it as a comparative figure. Consider someone who has $100 in 1950 versus someone with $100 in 2020. Although both people may have $100—which is the nominal value—the real value is not the same, where the nominal value does not factor in inflation. The nominal value of an asset can also mean its face value. For example, a bond with a face value of $1,000 has a nominal value of $1,000.
Nominal vs. Real
The term real, as opposed to nominal, expresses the value of something after making adjustments for various factors in creating a more accurate measure. For example, the difference between nominal and real GDP is that nominal GDP measures the economic output of a country using current market prices, and real GDP takes inflation into account to create a more accurate measure.
Nominal vs. Real Rate of Return
The
rate of return
(RoR) is the amount an investor earns on an investment. While the nominal rate of return reflects the investor's earnings as a percentage of the initial investment, the real rate takes inflation into account. As a result, the real rate gives a more accurate assessment of the actual buying power of the investor's earnings.
For example, imagine you buy a $10,000 stock and sell it the following year for $11,000. Your nominal rate of return is 10%. However, to get a more accurate picture of your
actual return
, this rate needs to be adjusted for inflation, as the
purchasing power
of your money has likely changed over the one year. Therefore, if inflation for that year is 4%, the real rate of return is only 6% or the nominal rate of return minus the rate of inflation.
Nominal vs. Real Interest Rates
Like the difference between nominal and real rates of return, the difference between nominal and real interest rates is that the latter is adjusted for inflation.
1
For example, if an investment is expected to return 7% interest, but the inflation rate is 4%, then the
real interest rate
on that investment is only 3%.
However, in terms of interest, the nominal rate also contrasts with the
annual percentage rate
(APR) and the
annual percentage yield
(APY). In the case of APY, the nominal, or stated rate is the rate the lender advertises, and it is the basic interest rate the consumer pays on the loan.
On the other hand, APR takes into account fees and other costs associated with the loan, and it calculates the interest rate with those factors in mind. For example, imagine a borrower takes out a $1,000 loan with a 5% nominal interest rate, but they also pay a $100 origination fee. During the first year of the loan, they face $50 in interest fees. However, when we factor in the origination fee, they pay $150 in fees and interest.
This total fee sum equates to a 15% APR. Conversely, APY takes both the fees and the effect of compounding into account to give the borrower an even more accurate picture of their interest rate.
Example of Nominal
As in the example above, the nominal value for someone who has $100 in 1950 does not change for someone who has $100 in 2020. What does change is the
purchasing power
, where inflation decreases purchasing power over time. Assuming an average annual inflation rate of 3.46% from 1950 to 2020, then what $100 would buy in 1950 would cost $1,081 in 2020. Thus, the real value of $100 in 1950 would be $1,081 in 2020.

Investopedia,"Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program Basics","Close
Definition
The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program is a federal system that offers income support to retirees, people with disabilities, and their families, funded through payroll taxes. It is commonly known as Social Security.
What Is the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program?
The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program is the official name for Social Security in the United States. The federal OASDI tax noted on your paycheck funds this program that provides benefits to retired adults and people with disabilities, and to their spouses, dependents, and survivors.
The goal of the program is to partially replace income that is lost due to old age, the death of a spouse (or qualifying ex-spouse), or disability.
Key Takeaways
Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is the official, though little-used name of the Social Security program in the U.S.
The program provides benefits to retired adults and people with disabilities, and to their dependents.
OASDI taxes, also known as the FICA payroll tax, fund the program from workers' wages and employer contributions.
Individuals and employers split the Social Security taxes, while self-employed individuals are responsible for both portions.
The amount of an individual’s monthly Social Security payment is based on their earnings during their working years.
How the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program Works
The U.S. Social Security program (including both retirement and disability income) was ushered in through the
Social Security Act
signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Aug. 14, 1935, when the U.S. economy was in the depths of the
Great Depression
. The program has grown massively over the decades, along with the U.S. population and economy.
1
2
3
In 1940, about 222,000 people received an average monthly benefit of $22.60. The average monthly benefit was $1,976 in January 2025. The benefit amount is reviewed annually and adjusted for inflation.
4
5
It is the largest such system in the world and is also the biggest expenditure in the federal budget, costing around $1.4 trillion in 2024. Nearly nine out of 10 individuals age 65 and older receive
Social Security benefits
.

Social Security benefits are determined by calculating the individual's
average indexed monthly earnings (AIME)
during the 35 years in which the person earned the most.
8
Important
Social Security recipients will receive a 2.5% increase in 2025 due to a cost-of-living adjustment. The increase in 2024 was 3.2%.
9
OASDI Payroll Tax
Payments to qualifying persons are funded through OASDI taxes, which are payroll taxes collected by the government. They are known as FICA taxes (short for
Federal Insurance Contributions Act
) and SECA taxes (short for
Self-Employed Contributions Act
).
10
The Social Security tax rate is 6.2% for employees and 12.4% for the self-employed. The combined federal tax rates for Social Security and
Medicare
are 7.65% and 15.3% for employees and self-employed, respectively.
11
These revenues are kept in two trust funds:
The
Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund
for retirement payments
The
Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund
for disability payments
These trust funds pay out the benefits and invest the remainder of the revenue they collect.
12
Note
There is a cap on annual earnings for which you pay Social Security tax. The maximum earnings subject to the tax were $168,600 in 2024 and are $176,100 in 2025. Income above those amounts is not subject to further OASDI tax.
13
OASDI Program Criteria
The OASDI program provides payments to people who meet certain criteria. For old-age payments, money is paid to qualifying persons starting as early as age 62. Full retirement age depends on the individual's birth date and is 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.
14
Qualifying persons who wait until age 70 (but no later) to begin collecting benefits collect higher, maximum benefits due to delayed retirement credits.
15
Payments are calculated based on people's past wages earned. Survivors' payments are made to surviving spouses or dependents of deceased workers. Disability payments are made to eligible persons who are no longer able to participate in a substantially gainful activity and who meet additional criteria.
16
17
To qualify for retirement benefits, a worker must be fully insured. A worker becomes fully insured by accumulating credits (also called quarters) of coverage. Credits or quarters are accumulated based on covered wages earned for a particular period. One-quarter of coverage is awarded to a worker for every $1,810 earned in 2025, up from $1,730 in 2024.
18
19
Note
A worker can earn up to four credits or quarters of coverage per year, and 40 credits are needed to qualify for Social Security income benefits.
20
Is OASDI Tax Mandatory?
Yes, federal law requires that workers and employers contribute to the OASDI fund through Social Security taxation on income of up to $176,100 in 2025, up from $168,600 in 2024.
13
At What Age Are Social Security Payments No Longer Taxed?
A portion of your
Social Security benefits is taxable
regardless of your age, unless your income is very low. Only individuals with incomes below $25,000 a year or couples with incomes below $32,000 a year keep their Social Security tax-free. Everyone else pays taxes on up to 85% of their benefits, depending on income.
21
How Can I Avoid Paying OASDI Tax?
There are very rare exceptions and exemptions to OASDI taxes, including clergy of certain religious groups and some types of nonresident aliens. Note, however, that these individuals are also ineligible to receive Social Security payments.
22
23
The Bottom Line
The OASDI Program is the federal benefits program better known as Social Security. It covers both retirement income for individuals and surviving spouses, as well as disability income. Workers pay into the program through a tax levied each year on a portion of their income at a rate of 6.2% for employees (or 12.4% for self-employed individuals).
11
That money is then paid out as income benefits to retired or disabled individuals at a rate that is adjusted regularly for inflation.

Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a type of financing for
startup
companies and small businesses with
long-term growth
potential.
Venture capital generally comes from investors, investment banks, and financial institutions. Venture capital can also be provided as technical or managerial expertise.
Key Takeaways
Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a type of financing for startup companies and small businesses with long-term growth potential.
Venture capitalists provide backing through financing, technological expertise, or managerial experience.
VC firms raise money from limited partners (LPs) to invest in promising startups or even larger venture funds.
Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
Understanding Venture Capital (VC)
VC provides
financing to startups and small companies
that investors believe have great growth potential. Financing typically comes in the form of
private equity (PE)
. Ownership positions are sold to a few investors through independent
limited partnerships
(LPs). Venture capital tends to focus on emerging companies, while PE tends to fund established companies seeking an equity infusion. VC is an essential source for raising money, especially if start-ups lack access to
capital markets
, bank loans, or other debt instruments.
1
Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot is generally considered the ""Father of Venture Capital."" He started the American Research and Development Corporation in 1946 and raised a $3.58 million fund to invest in companies that commercialized technologies developed during World War II.
2
3
The corporation's first investment was in a company that had ambitions to use X-ray technology for cancer treatment. The $200,000 that Doriot invested turned into $1.8 million when the company went public in 1955.
3
VC became synonymous with the growth of technology companies in Silicon Valley on the West Coast. By 1992, 48% of all investment dollars went into West Coast companies; Northeast Coast industries accounted for just 20%.
4
During 2022, West Coast companies accounted for more than 37% of all deals while the Mid-Atlantic region saw just around 24% of all deals.

Types of Venture Capital
Pre-Seed:
This is the earliest stage of business development when the startup founders try to turn an idea into a concrete business plan. They may enroll in a business accelerator to secure early funding and mentorship.
Seed Funding:
This is the point where a new business seeks to launch its first product. Since there are no revenue streams yet, the company will need VCs to fund all of its operations.
Early-Stage Funding:
Once a business has developed a product, it will need additional capital to ramp up production and sales before it can become self-funding. The business will then need one or more funding rounds, typically denoted incrementally as Series A, Series B, etc.
$285 billion
The amount global VC-backed companies raised in 2023.
6
How to Secure VC Funding
Submit a Business Plan:
Any business looking for venture capital must submit a business plan to a venture capital firm or an
angel investor
. The firm or the investor will perform
due diligence
, which includes a thorough investigation of the company's
business model
, products, management team, and operating history.
Investment Pledge:
Once due diligence has been completed, the firm or the investor will pledge
an investment of capital
in exchange for equity in the company. These funds may be provided all at once, but more typically the capital is provided in rounds. The firm or investor then takes an active role in the funded company, advising and monitoring its progress before releasing additional funds.
Exit:
The investor exits the company after some time, typically four to six years after the
initial investment
, by initiating a
merger
, acquisition, or
initial public offering (IPO)
.
Important
Many
venture capitalists
have had prior investment experience, often as equity
research analysts
. VC professionals tend to concentrate on a particular industry. A venture capitalist who specializes in healthcare, for example, may have had prior experience as a healthcare industry analyst.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Venture Capital
Venture capital provides funding to new businesses that do not have enough cash flow to take on debts. This arrangement can be mutually beneficial because businesses get the capital they need to bootstrap their operations, and investors gain equity in promising companies. VCs often provide mentoring and networking services to help them find talent and advisors. A strong VC backing can be leveraged into further investments.
However, a business that accepts venture capital support can lose creative control over its future direction. VC investors are likely to demand a large share of company equity, and they may make demands of the company's management. Many VCs are only seeking to make a fast, high-return payoff and may pressure the company for a quick exit.
Pros
Provides early-stage companies with capital to bootstrap operations
Companies don't need cash flow or assets to secure VC funding
VC-backed mentoring and networking services help new companies secure talent and growth
Cons
Demand a large share of company equity
Companies may find themselves losing creative control as investors demand immediate returns
VCs may pressure companies to exit investments rather than pursue long-term growth
Angel Investors
Venture capital can be provided by
high net-worth individuals (HNWIs)
, also often known as angel investors, or venture capital firms. The National Venture Capital Association is an organization composed of venture capital firms that fund innovative enterprises.
7
Angel investors are typically a diverse group of individuals who have amassed their wealth through a variety of sources. However, they tend to be
entrepreneurs
themselves, or recently retired executives from business empires. The majority look to invest in well-managed companies, that have a fully-developed
business plan
and are poised for substantial growth.
These investors are also likely to offer to fund ventures that are involved in the same or similar industries or business sectors with which they are familiar. Another common occurrence among angel investors is
co-investing
, in which one angel investor funds a venture alongside a trusted friend or associate, often another angel investor.
Venture Capital Success
Due to the industry's proximity to Silicon Valley, the overwhelming majority of deals financed by venture capitalists occurred in the technology industry—the internet, healthcare, computer hardware and services, and mobile and telecommunications. In 2023, San Francisco still ranked highest among VC investments.
8
While technology dominates VC funding, other industries have also benefited from VC funding. VC has matured over time and the industry comprises an assortment of players and investor types who invest in different stages of a startup's evolution.
Regarding VC success rates, it's important to note that venture capital is a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy. According to research more than 75% of venture-backed startups fail to return investors' capital, and less than 75% of startup founders receive anything at all upon exit.
9
10
Indeed, the majority of VC-backed firms fail, with only 5-7% of all investments accounting for the majority of returns.
11
Indeed, VC firms generate most of their returns from only a small number of successful ""home runs"" that produce excess returns. While the average VC fund returns can be upwards of 15% annually, the median VC-backed startup fails to return investor capital.
12
Examples of Venture Capital Investments
Apple
: In 1978, Apple received $250,000 in VC funding from Sequoia Capital and Arthur Rock. This early investment helped Apple develop its first mass-market personal computer, the Apple II.
13
Google
: In 1998, Google received $100,000 from angel investor Andy Bechtolsheim. Shortly after, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins invested a combined $25 million, which helped Google develop its search engine technology.

Definition
A margin call is a broker’s demand that an investor who has borrowed money to buy securities must deposit more money or securities into their account so it’s brought up a minimum value.
A margin call is a request for funds from a broker when money must be added to a margin account to meet minimum capital requirements. A margin call occurs when the percentage of an investor’s equity in a
margin account
falls below the broker’s required amount.
An investor’s margin account contains securities bought with a combination of the investor’s own money and money that was borrowed from the investor’s broker.
A margin call refers specifically to a broker’s demand that an investor deposit additional money or securities into the account so the value of the investor's equity and the account value rise to a minimum value indicated by the
maintenance requirement
.
A margin call is usually an indicator that the securities held in the margin account have decreased in value. The investor must choose to either deposit additional funds or marginable securities in the account or sell some of the assets held in their account when a margin call occurs.
Key Takeaways
A margin call occurs when a margin account runs low on funds, usually because of a losing trade.
Margin calls are demands for additional capital or securities to bring a margin account up to the maintenance requirement.
Brokers may force a trader to sell assets, regardless of the market price, to meet the margin call if the trader doesn’t deposit funds.
Margin calls can also occur when a stock goes up in price and losses start mounting in accounts that have sold the stock short.
Investors can avoid margin calls by monitoring their equity and keeping enough funds in their accounts to maintain the value above the required maintenance level.
Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
What Triggers a Margin Call?
An investor is buying on margin when they pay to buy and sell securities using a combination of their own funds and money borrowed from a broker. An investor’s equity in the investment is equal to the
market value
of the securities minus the borrowed amount.

Important
A margin call is triggered when the investor’s equity as a percentage of the total market value of securities falls below a certain required level called the maintenance margin.
The
New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA), the regulatory body for the majority of securities firms operating in the United States, both require that investors maintain an equity level of 25% of the total value of their securities when buying on margin.
2
3
Some brokerage firms may require a higher maintenance requirement, such as 50%. It is at their discretion.
Margin calls can occur at any time due to a drop in account value but they're more likely to happen during periods of market volatility.
Example of a Margin Call
Here's an example of how a change in the value of a margin account decreases an investor's equity to a level where a broker must issue a margin call.

How to Cover a Margin Call
The investor typically has two to five days to act if their account value drops to a level where a margin call is issued by their broker. These are the options for doing so using the margin call example above:
Deposit $200 in cash into the account.
Deposit $285 of fully paid-for marginable securities into the account. This amount is derived by dividing the required funds of $200 by 1 less the 30% equity requirement: 200/(1-.30) = $285.
Use a combination of the above two options.
Sell other securities to obtain the needed cash.
A broker may close out any open positions to replenish the account to the minimum required value if an investor isn't able to meet the margin call. They may be able to do this without the investor’s approval. The broker may also charge an investor a commission on these transaction(s). The investor is held responsible for any losses sustained during this process.
Note
The amount of a margin loan depends on a security's purchase price and is therefore a fixed amount. But the dollar amount determined by the maintenance margin requirement is based on the current account value, not on the initial purchase price. That's why it fluctuates.
How to Avoid a Margin Call
Investors should carefully consider whether they need a margin account before opening one. Most long-term investors don't have to buy on margin to earn solid returns. And these loans aren't free. Brokerages charge interest on them.
But there are a few things you can do to manage your account, avoid a margin call, or be ready for it if you want to invest with margin:
Make sure cash is available to place in your account immediately. Consider keeping it in an interest-earning account at the same brokerage.
Build a
well-diversified portfolio
. This may help limit margin calls because a single position is less likely to decrease the account value.
Monitor your open positions, equity, and margin loans regularly, even daily.
Create a custom-made alert at some comfortable level above the margin maintenance requirement. Deposit funds or securities to increase your equity if your account falls to it.
Take care of it immediately if you receive a margin call.
A good way for an investor to avoid margin calls is to use protective stop orders to limit losses in any equity positions in addition to keeping adequate cash and securities in their account.
Is It Risky to Trade Stocks on Margin?
It's certainly riskier to trade stocks with margin than without it because trading stocks on margin is trading with borrowed money. Leveraged trades are riskier than unleveraged ones. The biggest risk with margin trading is that investors can lose more than they've invested.
How Can a Margin Call Be Met?
A margin call is issued by the broker when there's a margin deficiency in the trader’s margin account. The trader has to either deposit cash or marginable securities in the margin account or liquidate some securities in the account to rectify a margin deficiency.
Can a Trader Delay Meeting a Margin Call?
A margin call must be satisfied immediately and without any delay. Some brokers may give you two to five days to meet the margin call but the fine print of a standard margin account agreement will generally state that the broker has the right to liquidate any or all securities or other assets held in the margin account at its discretion and without prior notice. It's best to meet a margin call and rectify the margin deficiency promptly to prevent such forced liquidation.
4
How Can I Manage the Risks Associated With Trading on Margin?
Measures to manage the risks associated with trading on margin include:
Using
stop-loss orders
to limit losses
Keeping the amount of leverage to manageable levels
Borrowing against a diversified portfolio to
reduce the probability of a margin call
which is significantly more likely with a single stock
Does the Total Level of Margin Debt Have an Impact on Market Volatility?
A high level of margin debt can exacerbate market volatility. Clients are forced to sell stocks to meet margin calls during steep market declines. This can lead to a vicious circle where intense selling pressure drives stock prices lower, triggering more margin calls and more selling.
The Bottom Line
Buying on margin isn't for everyone. Not all investors will have available funds to reach
initial and maintenance margins
on margin trading accounts. It can give investors more bang for their buck but there are downsides.
It's only an advantage if your securities increase enough to repay the margin loan and the interest on it. Another headache can be the margin calls for funds that investors must meet.
A margin call may require you to deposit additional cash and securities. You may even have to sell existing holdings or you may have to close out the margined position at a loss. Margin calls can occur when markets are volatile so you may have",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp

What Is an Overdraft?
An overdraft occurs when there isn't enough money in an account to cover a transaction or withdrawal, but the bank allows the transaction anyway. Essentially, it's an extension of
credit
from the financial institution that is granted when an account reaches zero.
The overdraft allows the account holder to continue withdrawing money even when the account has no funds in it or has insufficient funds to cover the amount of the withdrawal.
Key Takeaways
An overdraft occurs when an account lacks the funds to cover a withdrawal, but the bank allows the transaction to go through anyway.
The overdraft allows the customer to continue paying bills even when there is insufficient money in their account.
Many banks impose additional fees or penalties for overdrawn accounts.
An overdraft is like any other loan: The account holder pays interest on it and will typically be charged a one-time insufficient funds fee.
Overdraft protection is provided by some banks to customers when their account reaches zero; it avoids insufficient funds charges, but often includes interest and other fees.
Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight
Understanding Overdrafts
With an overdraft account, a bank is covering payments a customer has made that would otherwise be rejected, or, in the case of actual physical checks, would
bounce
and be returned without payment. Basically, an overdraft means that the bank allows customers to borrow a set amount of money. There is interest on the loan, and there is typically a fee per overdraft. At some banks, an overdraft fee can run upwards of $37.
1
As with any loan, the borrower pays interest on the outstanding balance of an overdraft loan. Often, the
interest on the loan is lower
than the interest on credit cards, making the overdraft a better short-term option in an
emergency
.
2
In many cases, there are additional fees for using overdraft protection that reduce the amount available to
cover your checks
, such as
insufficient funds fees
per check or withdrawal.
While banks can charge overdraft fees, they can't change the order of a customer's transactions to collect more overdraft fees. In 2010, Wells Fargo was fined $203 million for the predatory practice of structuring customer withdrawals in a way that maximized overdraft fees.

Important
In 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found some financial institutions charged unfair overdraft fees by authorizing an ATM or debit transaction made when the customer had a positive balance, but later charging an overdraft fee because intervening transactions went through before the debit settled. The CFPB found customers couldn't reasonably avoid these surprise fees. It told the banks and credit unions to stop charging overdraft fees in these situations, and a number of them have come up with plans to refund customers who were charged the fees in the past.
4
Special Considerations
Your bank can opt to use its own funds to cover your overdraft.
5
Another option is to link the overdraft to a credit card. If the bank uses its own funds to cover your overdraft, it typically won't affect your credit score.
6
When a credit card is used for overdraft protection, it's possible that you can increase your debt to the point where it could affect your
credit score
. However, this won't show up as a problem with overdrafts on your checking accounts.
If you don't pay your overdrafts back in a predetermined amount of time, your bank can turn over your account to a collection agency. This collection action can affect your credit score and get reported to the three main
credit agencies
: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. It depends on how the account is reported to the agencies as to whether it shows up as a problem with an overdraft on a checking account.
Warning
If an overdrawn account isn't paid off in time, the bank may turn the debt over to a
collection agency
.
Overdraft Protection
Some but not all banks will
pay overdrafts automatically
, as a courtesy to the customer (while charging fees, of course).
Overdraft protection
provides the customer with a further tool to prevent embarrassing shortfalls that reflect poorly on your ability to pay.
Usually, it works by linking your checking account to a savings account, another checking account, or a
line of credit
. If there's a shortfall, this source gets tapped for the funds, ensuring that you won't have a check returned or a transaction/transfer declined. It also avoids triggering a non-sufficient funds (NSF) charge.
The dollar amount of overdraft protection varies by account and by bank. Often, the customer needs to specifically request it. There are a variety of
pros and cons to using
overdraft protection, but one thing to bear in mind is that banks aren't providing the service out of the goodness of their hearts. They usually charge a fee for it.
As such, customers should be sure to rely on overdraft protection sparingly and only in an emergency. If the overdraft protection is used excessively, the financial institution can remove the protection from the account.
What Is an Overdraft Fee?
An overdraft is a loan provided by a bank that allows a customer to pay for bills and other expenses when the account reaches zero. For a fee, the bank provides a loan to the client in the event of an unexpected charge or insufficient account balance. Typically, these accounts will charge a one-time funds fee and interest on the outstanding balance.
How Does Overdraft Protection Work?
Under overdraft protection, if a client’s checking account enters a negative balance, they will be able to access a predetermined loan provided by the bank and be charged a fee. In many cases, overdraft protection is used to prevent a check from bouncing and the embarrassment that this may cause. Additionally, it may prevent a non-sufficient funds fee, but in many cases, each type of fee will be roughly the same amount.
What Are the Pros and Cons of Overdrafts?
The pros of overdraft involve providing coverage when an account unexpectedly has insufficient funds, and avoiding embarrassment and ""returned check"" charges from merchants or creditors. But it's important to weigh the costs. Overdraft protection often comes with a significant fee and interest, which, if not paid off in a timely manner, can add an additional burden to the account holder. According to the CFPB, customers who had overdraft protection, in fact, often paid more in fees than those without it.
7
The Bottom Line
An overdraft is a temporary loan that allows bank customers to continue paying bills or withdrawing money even after their accounts are empty. This can be useful in emergencies, especially if the bank offers overdraft protection. However, overdrawing an account incurs additional penalties or interest, and should be avoided if possible.

Investopedia,"SEC Form 10-Q: Definition, Deadlines for Filing, and Components","Close
What Is SEC Form 10-Q?
SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive unaudited report of financial performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
. It stands in contrast to SEC Form 10-K, which is required to be filed annually and is audited.
In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their finances related to their business operations. A 10-Q must be filed for each of the first three quarters of the company's fiscal year.
Key Takeaways
SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive quarterly report of financial performance submitted by all public companies to the SEC.
Form 10-Q contains financial statements, management discussion and analysis, disclosures, and internal controls for the previous quarter.
Companies must file their 10-Qs 40 or 45 days after the end of their quarters, depending on the size of their public float.
A snapshot of a company's financial position, Form 10-Q provides investors with information they can compare to previous periods and use to evaluate the outlook for the stock's performance.
Form 10-Q is not an audited statement, unlike the annual Form 10-K that companies are also required to file.
Important
While 10-K reports are due annually and must include audited financial statements, 10-Q reports are due quarterly and are generally unaudited financial statements.
Understanding SEC Form 10-Q
Federal securities laws mandate that publicly traded companies provide certain information to shareholders and the general public. These
disclosures
may occur periodically or as specific events occur.
A company utilizes Form 10-Q—one of many required by the SEC—upon the completion of each quarter to release unaudited financial statements and give an overview of the company’s financial situation.
The exact filing dates depend on the organization’s fiscal year, but it is necessary to file three 10-Q reports each year.
1
A 10-Q for the final quarter of the year is not required: A company files Form 10-K, an annual report, instead. This report, unlike the 10-Q, is audited and tends to contain more details.

Note
A company's Form 10-Q is public information. Anyone who wishes to examine a company's quarterly report can go to the SEC's
EDGAR database
. You can search by company name, ticker symbol, or SEC Central Index Key (CIK). Many companies also post their 10-Qs on their websites, in an ""Investor Relations"" section.
SEC Form 10-Q Filing Deadlines
The deadline for filing a 10-Q varies and depends on the number of outstanding shares a company has.
3
A company filing a 10-Q is classified in one of three categories. Its category is determined by its public
float
—that is, the portion of outstanding stock that is in the hands of the public, and not held by officers, owners, or the government. Essentially, the float is comprised of all of a company’s freely traded common stock shares.
The largest companies are classified as large accelerated filers. To fit this classification, an organization must have at least $700 million in public float. Large accelerated filers have 40 days after the close of the quarter to file a 10-Q.
Accelerated filers are companies with at least $75 million in public float but less than $700 million. They also have 40 days to file the 10-Q (they have a little more time to file the 10-K).
Finally, non-accelerated filers are companies with less than $75 million of public float. These companies have 45 days from the end of the quarter to file a 10-Q.

Failure to Meet the Form 10-Q Filing Deadline
When a company fails to file a 10-Q by the filing deadline, it must make a non-timely (NT) filing of SEC Form
NT 10-Q
.
4
An NT filing must explain why the deadline has not been met. It includes a request for an additional five days to file.
5
As long as a company has a reasonable explanation, the SEC allows late filings within a specified time period. Common reasons why companies are not able to file on time include
mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
, corporate litigation, an ongoing review by corporate auditors, or lingering effects from bankruptcy.
A 10-Q filing is considered timely if it is filed within this extension period. Failure to comply with this extended deadline results in consequences, including the potential loss of the SEC registration, removal from stock exchanges, and legal ramifications.
Components of SEC Form 10-Q
There are two parts to a 10-Q filing. The first part contains relevant financial information covering the period. This includes condensed financial statements, management discussion, analysis of the financial condition of the entity, disclosures regarding
market risk
, and internal controls.
6
The second part contains all other pertinent information. This includes legal proceedings, unregistered sales of equity securities, the use of proceeds from the sale of unregistered sales of equity, and defaults upon senior securities. The company discloses any other information—and includes exhibits—in this section.
Note
Form 10-Q, and the requirement for filing it, was established by the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
. The aim was to promote transparency in public companies' operations by providing investors with the financial position of companies on an ongoing basis.
Importance of SEC Form 10-Q
The 10-Q provides a window into the financial health of a company. Investors can use the form to get a sense of its quarterly earnings and other elements of its operations and to compare them to previous quarters. Thus, it is a dependable performance-tracking tool.
Some areas of interest to investors that are commonly visible in the 10-Q include changes to working capital and/or accounts receivables, factors affecting a company's inventory, share buybacks, and even any legal risks that a company faces.
You can compare a close competitor's 10-Q to that of a company in which you are invested, or considering whether to invest, to see how its performance stacks up. This will give you an idea of whether it's a strong choice, where its weaknesses are, and how it could improve.
Other Important SEC Filings
The 10-Q is one of many reports that public companies are required to file with the SEC. Other important and mandated filings include:
Form 10-K
:
The 10-K must be filed once per year and includes the final quarter of the company's performance (replacing a fourth-quarter 10-Q). The 10-K summarizes the year, often contains more detailed information than an annual report, and must be filed within 90 days of the end of a company's fiscal year. It generally includes a summary of the company's operations, management's financial outlook, financial statements, and any legal or administrative issues involving the company.
Form 8-K
: This report is filed if there are any changes or developments to a business that didn't make the 10-Q or 10-K reports. The 8-K is considered an unscheduled document and may contain information such as press releases. If a company disposes of or acquires assets, has announcements of executive hiring or departures, or goes into receivership, this information is filed with an 8-K.
Annual report
:
A company's annual report is filed every year, and contains a wealth of company news including—but not limited to—general information about the company, a letter to shareholders from the CEO, financial statements, and an auditors report. This report is submitted a few months after the end of a company's fiscal year. The report is available through a company's website or investor relations team, and can also be obtained from the SEC.
Are Public Companies Required to File Form 10-Q?
Yes, all U. S. public companies issuing common shares of stock that trade on exchanges are required to file Form 10-Q. The date by which they have to file varies according to the number of shares, expressed in terms of dollar worth, that they have outstanding.
Who Signs Form 10-Q?
According to the SEC, ""At least one complete copy of the report filed with the Commission and one such copy filed with each exchange must be manually signed on the registrant’s behalf by a duly authorized officer of the registrant and by the principal financial or chief accounting officer of the registrant."" More information is available in the instructions for Form 10-Q.
7
Must Review Reports Accompany Financial Statements in a 10-Q?
10-Qs generally are not audited or accompanied by accountants' reports. SEC regulations prohibit companies from making materially false or misleading statements or omitting material information to make disclosures not misleading. The SEC staff reviews 10-Qs and may provide comments to a company where disclosures appear to be inconsistent with the disclosure requirements or deficient in explanation or clarity.
8
The Bottom Line
SEC Form 10-Q is a report filed by public companies and sent to the SEC after the close of each of the first three quarters of every year. The final quarter is covered by SEC Form 10-K, an annual report.
Form 10-Q can be a valuable research tool for investors because it contains a substantial amount of financial data about a company's quarterly performance, as well as information regarding business operations, management discussions, pertinent market risks, and disclosures.

Definition
Asset management refers to the process of identifying and managing a company's assets to maximize their value and achieve business objectives.
What Is Asset Management?
Asset management is the practice of investing money on behalf of clients. Asset managers work to increase wealth over time, following a personalized plan that reflects the client's risk tolerance and financial goals.
Asset managers may also be called portfolio managers or financial advisors. Many work independently, while others work for a financial services company such as BlackRock or Fidelity. Robo-advisors are a modern type of asset manager.
Key Takeaways
The goal of asset management is to maximize the value of an investment portfolio over time while maintaining a level of risk that the client finds acceptable.
Asset management clients include individuals, government entities, corporations, and institutional investors.
Asset managers have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of their clients.
Investopedia / Sydney Saporito
Understanding Asset Management
Asset management has a double-barreled goal: increasing value while mitigating risk. Tolerance for risk is one of the first topics that an asset manager might raise with a client.
A retiree living on the income from a portfolio or a pension fund administrator overseeing retirement funds is (or should be) risk-averse. On the other hand, a young person, or an aggressive investor of any age, might want to dabble in high-risk investments.
Most people fall in between these two extremes, and asset managers try to identify where a client's risk tolerance lies. Thus, an asset manager's role is to determine what investments to make or avoid and to realize the client's financial goals within the client's risk tolerance limits.

The investments they select may include stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, alternative investments, and mutual funds, among the better-known choices.
Asset management can involve rigorous research using both macro and micro analytical tools. This research includes statistical analysis of prevailing market trends,
reviews of corporate financial documents
, and anything else that would aid in achieving the client's stated goal of asset appreciation.
Types of Asset Managers
There are several different types of asset managers, distinguished by the kinds of assets they specialize in and the level of service they provide. Each type of asset manager has a different level of responsibility to the client, so it is important to understand a manager's obligations to their clients before deciding to invest.
Registered Investment Advisers
A
registered investment adviser (RIA)
is a firm that advises clients on security trades and
manages their portfolios
. RIAs are closely regulated and are
required to register with the SEC
if they manage more than $100 million in assets.
Broker
A broker is an individual or firm that acts as an intermediary for their clients, buying stocks and other securities and serving as custodian of customer assets. Brokers generally do not have a
fiduciary
duty to their clients, so it is always important to research them thoroughly before becoming a client and buying anything.
Financial Advisor
A financial advisor is a professional who can recommend investments to their clients and buy and sell securities on their behalf. Financial advisors may or may not be fiduciaries. Some financial advisors specialize in a specific area, such as tax or estate planning.
Robo-Advisor
The most affordable type of investment manager isn't a person at all. A robo-advisor is a computer algorithm that automatically builds, monitors, and rebalances an investor's portfolio to suit their needs. They sell and buy investments aligned with programmed goals and risk tolerances. Because there is no person involved, services provided by robo-advisors cost much less than personalized asset management handled by human beings.
Fast Fact
The robo-advisor market is expected to grow from $9.5 billion in 2024 to $72 billion in 2032.
1
Cost of Asset Management
Asset managers have a variety of fee structures. The most common model charges a percentage of the assets under management, with the industry average at about 1% for up to $1 million. Larger portfolios are usually charged fewer and lower fees due to their size. Other asset managers may charge a fee for each trade they execute. Some may even receive a commission to upsell securities to their clients.
Because such incentives (and transactions) might not be in a client's best interest, it is important to know if your asset management firm is a fiduciary. If it is not, it may recommend investments or trades that are inappropriate for a client's investment experience and financial goals.
Fast Fact
The new Retirement Security Rule requires investment professionals who advise people on their retirement accounts to act as fiduciaries. This means their advice must be in the best interest of the retirement investor and not of the finance professional.
2
How Asset Management Companies Work
Asset management companies compete to serve the investment needs of individuals and institutions. Account holders at financial institutions such as banks often receive check-writing privileges, credit cards, debit cards,
margin loans
, and brokerage services.
When individuals deposit money into their accounts, it is typically placed into a money market fund that offers a greater return than a regular savings account. The deposits of investors with accounts at banks insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC)
are protected up to at least $250,000 per depositor. However, FDIC insurance does not cover investment products that are not deposits, such as mutual funds, annuities, and stocks and bonds.
3
These types of accounts at banks have only been possible since the passage of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999
, which replaced the Glass-Steagall Act. The
Glass-Steagall Act
of 1933, passed during the Great Depression, forced a separation between banking and investing services. Now, they have only to maintain a ""
Chinese wall
"" between divisions.
Fast Fact
The added benefit to account holders whose assets are managed at banks is that the same institution can meet all of their banking and investing needs.
Example of an Asset Management Company
Investment management and wealth management firm Merrill (previously known as Merrill Lynch) offers a Cash Management Account (CMA) to fulfill the needs of clients who wish to pursue banking and investment options under one roof.
4
The account gives investors access to a personal financial advisor. This advisor offers advice and a range of investment options that include initial public offerings (IPO) in which Merrill may participate, as well as foreign currency transactions.
Interest rates for cash deposits are tiered. Deposit accounts can be linked so that all eligible funds are aggregated to receive the best possible rate. Securities held in the account fall under the protective umbrella of the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)
. SIPC does not shield investor assets from inherent risk but instead protects them from the financial failure of the brokerage firm.
Along with typical check-writing services, the account offers worldwide access to Bank of America automated teller machines (ATM) without transaction fees. Bill payment services, fund transfers, and wire transfers are available. The MyMerrill app allows users to access their accounts and perform several basic functions via a mobile device.
Accounts with more than $250,000 in eligible assets sidestep the annual $125 fee and the $25 assessment applied to each sub-account held.
5
How Does an Asset Management Company Differ From a Brokerage?
Asset management companies are
fiduciary
firms, and are generally used by people with significant assets. They usually have discretionary trading authority over accounts and are legally bound to act in good faith on the client's behalf. Brokerages execute and facilitate trades but do not necessarily manage clients' portfolios (although some do). Brokerages are not usually fiduciaries.

Definition
A positive correlation is a statistical term used to describe a situation when two variables move in the same direction.
What Is Positive Correlation?
A positive correlation means two variables move in the same direction, so when one thing goes up so does the other. Similarly, when one goes down, the other one follows. The idea behind a positive correlation is that both variables are theoretically influenced by the same external factors. For instance, when companies spend money on their marketing efforts, their sales may increase. Similarly, if you exercise more, your health may improve. Industry officials can use these correlations to make important decisions and predictions about one variable based on the behavior of the other.
Key Takeaways
A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables that tend to move in the same direction.
Both variables in a positive correlation tend to be influenced by the same external factors.
Positive correlations can be used as important decision-making tools.
Investopedia / Ellen Lindner
Understanding Positive Correlation
A perfectly positive
correlation
means that 100% of the time, the variables in question move together by the exact same percentage and direction. A positive correlation can be seen between the demand for a product and the product's associated price. In situations where the available supply stays the same, the price will rise if demand increases.
Additionally, gains or losses in certain markets may lead to similar movements in associated markets. As the price of fuel rises, the prices of airline tickets also rise. Since airplanes require fuel to operate, an increase in this cost is often passed to the consumer, leading to a positive correlation between fuel prices and airline ticket prices.
A positive correlation does not guarantee
growth
or benefit. Instead, it is used to denote any two or more variables that move in the same direction together, so when one increases, so does the other. The existence of a correlation does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between variables.
Correlation is a form of dependency, where a shift in one variable means a change is likely in the other, or that certain known variables produce specific results. A general example can be seen within complementary product demand. If the demand for vehicles rises, so will the demand for vehicular-related products and services, such as tires. An increase in one area affects complementary industries.

In some situations, positive psychological responses can cause positive changes within an area. This can be demonstrated within the financial markets, in cases where general positive news about a company leads to a higher stock price.
Important
Correlation among variables does not necessarily imply causation.
Measuring Positive Correlation
In statistics, a perfect positive correlation is represented by the
correlation coefficient
value +1.0, while 0 indicates no correlation, and -1.0 indicates a perfect inverse (negative) correlation.
Positive correlation may also be easily identified by graphically depicting a data set using a scatter plot. Each point on a scatter plot represents one sample item at the intersection of the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. A positive correlation on a scatter plot is evidenced by an upward-trending series of points that show that as the x-axis variable increases, so does the y-axis variable.
When statistically analyzing positive correlation, it is important to understand the dataset's
p-value
. P-value is the measurement of how statistically significant the findings are. In general, a lower p-value, typically 0.05 or less, indicates there is greater evidence that an observed correlation is statistically significant and not due to random chance.
Positive Correlation in Finance
A simple
example of positive correlation
involves the use of an interest-bearing savings account with a set interest rate. The more money that is added to the account, whether through new deposits or earned interest, the more interest that can be accrued. Similarly, a rise in the interest rate will correlate with a rise in interest generated, while a decrease in the interest rate causes a decrease in actual interest accrued.
Investors and analysts also look at how stock movements correlate with one another and with the broader market. Most stocks correlate with each other's price movements somewhere in the middle of the range, with a coefficient of 0 indicating no relationship whatsoever between the two securities.
A stock in the online retail space, for example, likely has little correlation with the stock of a tire and auto body shop, while two similar retail companies will see a higher correlation. This is because businesses that have very different operations will produce different products and services using different inputs. Each of these companies faces different risks, opportunities, and operational challenges.
Positive Correlation and Diversification
Modern portfolio theory
is heavily rooted in diversification, the concept that an investor should hold assets that are widely unrelated to reduce portfolio-wide risk. This flies in the face of positive correlation; investing theory usually states that investors should be wary of widespread positive correlation within their portfolio.
For most investors, an ideal investing strategy is to avoid a positive correlation between assets and asset classes. Though every individual should evaluate their own investing strategy, holding assets with positive correlation tends to increase the risk of loss.
Beta and Correlation
Beta is a common measure of how correlated an individual stock's price is with the broader market, often using the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. If a stock has a
beta
of 1.0, it indicates that its price activity is strongly correlated with the market.
A stock with a beta of 1.0 has a systematic risk, but the beta calculation can’t detect any unsystematic risk. Adding a stock to a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 doesn’t add any risk to the portfolio, but it also doesn’t increase the likelihood that the portfolio will provide an excess return.
A beta of less than 1.0 means that the security is theoretically less volatile than the market, meaning the portfolio is less risky with the stock included than without it. For example, utility stocks often have low betas because they tend to move more slowly than market averages.
A beta that is greater than 1.0 indicates that the security's price is theoretically more volatile than the market. For example, if a stock's beta is 1.2, it is assumed to be 20% more volatile than the market. Technology stocks and small caps tend to have higher betas than the market benchmark. This indicates that adding the stock to a portfolio will increase the portfolio’s risk, but also increase its expected return.
Some stocks even have negative betas. A beta of -1.0 means that the stock is inversely correlated to the market benchmark as if it were an opposite, mirror image of the benchmark’s trends. Put options or inverse ETFs are designed to have negative betas, but there are a few industry groups, like gold miners, where a negative beta is also common.
Beta
A beta of +1.0 indicates a stock that moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. A beta of -1.0 indicates that a stock moves opposite to the rest of the market.
Positive Correlation vs. Negative Correlation
A negative correlation is sometimes described as an inverse correlation. In statistics, a positive correlation describes the relationship between two variables that change together, while an
inverse correlation
describes the relationship between two variables that change in opposing directions.
Examples of positive correlations occur in most people's daily lives. The more hours an employee works, for instance, the larger that employee's paycheck will be at the end of the week. The more money is spent on advertising, the more customers buy from the company.
Inverse correlations describe two factors that seesaw relative to each other. Examples include a declining bank balance relative to increased spending habits and reduced gas mileage relative to increased average driving speed.

Calculating net operating income (NOI) helps measure the profitability of an income-producing property.
What Is Net Operating Income (NOI)?
Net operating income (NOI) shows the profitability of income-generating real estate investments. NOI includes all
revenue
from the property, minus necessary
operating expenses
. However, NOI is a before-income-tax figure on a property’s income and cash flow statement, excluding principal and interest payments on loans, capital expenditures, depreciation, and
amortization
.
Key Takeaways
Net operating income (NOI) measures an income-producing property’s profitability.
To calculate NOI, subtract all operating expenses incurred on a property from all revenue generated.
NOI helps a property owner determine if renting a property is worth the expense of owning and maintaining it.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
What NOI Tells Real Estate Investors
NOI looks at the total revenue vs. the total operating expenses of a rental property. Revenue is income from rent, parking or storage fees, and on-site vending machines or laundry services. Operating expenses include maintenance and repairs,
property taxes
and insurance, property management fees, janitorial services, and utilities.
Capital expenditures
, such as costs for a new air conditioning system for the entire building, are not included in NOI.
NOI is used to calculate the
capitalization rate
, a measure of an investment property's profitability relative to its total cost. The cap rate is calculated by dividing the NOI by the property's total cost. Expressed as a percentage, the capitalization rate helps investors compare the returns of different properties.
For financed properties, NOI is also used in the
debt coverage ratio (DCR)
, which tells lenders and investors whether a property’s income covers its operating expenses and debt payments. NOI is also used to calculate the net income multiplier, cash return on investment, and total return on investment.
Important
A property's capitalization rate is also known as
return on investment (ROI)
in real estate.

The following information is an example of a rental condominium:
Revenue:
Rental income: $20,000
Parking fees: $5,000
Laundry machines: $1,000
Total Revenues = $26,000
Operating Expenses:
Property management fees: $1,000
Property taxes: $5,000
Repair and maintenance: $3,000
Insurance: $1,000
Total Operating Expenses = $10,000
The net operating income (NOI) is $26,000 - $10,000 = $16,000.
Profit and Loss
An owner who collects $120,000 in revenues and incurs $80,000 in operating expenses will have a resulting NOI of $40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000). If the total is negative, with higher costs than revenues, the result is called a
net operating loss (NOL)
.
Creditors and commercial lenders rely heavily on NOI to determine the income generation potential of a mortgaged property. NOI helps lenders forecast a property’s cash flows. If a property is profitable, the lenders also use this figure to determine the amount they are willing to lend. Lenders may reject a
mortgage application
if a property shows a net operating loss.
1
Property owners can manipulate operating expenses by deferring certain expenses while accelerating others. NOI can also be increased by raising rents and other fees while decreasing operating costs. If an apartment owner waives a tenant’s yearly $12,000 rent in exchange for that renter acting as a property manager, valued as a $30,000 cost, the owner may subtract the cost from the revenue.
How Does Net Operating Income Differ From Gross Operating Income?
Net operating income estimates the potential revenue from an investment property. However, it does not account for costs such as mortgage financing. NOI is different from
gross operating income
. Net operating income is gross operating income minus operating expenses.
Is NOI Used in Other Industries or Sectors?
NOI is used in other industries and referred to as EBIT, which means
earnings before interest and taxes
.
What Is a Good Net Operating Income Percentage?
NOI is not a percentage but a number that weighs the revenues against the expenses of a property. It can be compared to the property’s value as if it had been paid in cash. In this case, the higher the net operating income to property price percentage, the better.
The Bottom Line
Net operating income (NOI) can assess a property's profitability. The calculation involves subtracting all operating expenses on the property from all the revenue generated from the property. The higher the revenues and the smaller the costs, the more profitable a property is.

Bernard Lawrence ""Bernie"" Madoff was an American financier who executed the largest
Ponzi scheme
in history, defrauding thousands of investors out of an estimated $65 billion over the course of at least 17 years.
He was also a pioneer in electronic trading and chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange in the early 1990s.
Madoff died in a prison hospital at age 82 on April 14, 2021, while serving a 150-year sentence for money laundering, securities fraud, and several other felonies.
1
Key Takeaways
Bernie Madoff was a money manager responsible for one of the largest financial frauds in modern history.
Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, which ran for decades, defrauded thousands of investors out of tens of billions of dollars.
Investors put their trust in Madoff because he created a front of respectability, his returns were high but not outlandish, and he claimed to use a legitimate strategy.
In 2009 Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.
Investopedia / Ellen Lindner
Early Life and Education
Madoff was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April 29, 1938, to Ralph and Sylvia Madoff. His father worked as a plumber before entering the financial industry with his wife.
2
They founded Gibraltar Securities, which was ultimately forced to close by the SEC.
3
4
Bernie earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Hofstra University in 1960 and briefly attended law school at Brooklyn Law School. While in college, Bernie married his high-school sweetheart, Ruth (née Alpern), with whom he later founded Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960.

At first, he traded penny stocks with $5,000 he earned installing sprinklers and working as a lifeguard.
5
Notable Accomplishments
Madoff appeared to have a chip on his shoulder and felt that he was not part of the Wall Street in-crowd. In an interview with journalist Steve Fishman, Madoff said, ""We were a small firm, we weren't a member of the New York Stock Exchange. It was very obvious.""
6
According to Madoff, he began to make a name for himself as a scrappy
market maker
. ""I was perfectly happy to take the crumbs,"" he told Fishman, giving the example of a client who wanted to sell eight bonds; a bigger firm would disdain that kind of order, but Madoff's would complete it.
7
Success finally came when he and his brother Peter began to build electronic trading capabilities—""artificial intelligence"" in Madoff's words—that attracted massive order flow and boosted the business by providing insights into market activity. ""I had all these major banks coming down, entertaining me,"" Madoff told Fishman. ""It was a head trip.""
8
He and four other Wall Street mainstays processed half of the
New York Stock Exchange
's order flow—controversially, he paid for much of it—and by the late 1980s, Madoff was making in the vicinity of $100 million a year.
Madoff would become chair of the Nasdaq exchange in 1990, and also served in that role in 1991 and 1993.
9
Scandal, Scheme, and Crime
At some point, Madoff attracted investors by claiming to generate large, steady returns through an investing strategy called split-strike conversion, a
legitimate trading strategy
.
What Madoff was really doing was depositing client funds into a single bank account that he used to pay existing clients who wanted to cash out. He funded the
redemptions
by attracting new investors and their capital. This is the classic Ponzi scheme model: Take in a constant stream of new money while paying enough back to maintain the appearance of outsized gains.
Inevitably, the fraud unraveled when the market turned sharply lower in late 2008 and too many clients sought to withdraw their money.
On Dec. 10, 2008, he confessed his wrongdoing to his sons—who worked at his firm. The following day, they turned him over to the authorities. Bernie remained adamant that his sons and his wife were not aware of his scheme.
The fund's last statements indicated it had $64.8 billion in client assets.
2
The Players
It is not certain when Madoff's
Ponzi scheme
began. He testified in court that it started in the early 1990s but his account manager, Frank DiPascali, who had been working at the firm since 1975, said the fraud had been occurring ""for as long as I remember.""
10
11
Even less clear is why Madoff carried out the scheme at all. ""I had more than enough money to support any of my lifestyle and my family's lifestyle. I didn't need to do this for that,"" he told Fishman, adding, ""I don't know why.""
The legitimate wings of the business were extremely lucrative, and Madoff could have earned the Wall Street elites' respect solely as a market maker and electronic trading pioneer.
12
Madoff repeatedly suggested to Fishman that he was not entirely to blame for the fraud. ""I just allowed myself to be talked into something and that's my fault,"" he said, without making it clear who talked him into it. ""I thought I could extricate myself after a period of time. I thought it would be a very short period of time, but I just couldn't.""
13
Madoff put some of the blame on his clients. Several wealthy individuals and a number of fund managers funneled vast amounts of money into Madoff's firm. Some were ""feeder funds"" that essentially handed over their clients' entire assets to Madoff to manage.
""Everybody was greedy, everybody wanted to go on, and I just went along with it,"" Madoff told Fishman. He indicated that these investors, at least, must have had their suspicions about the returns he claimed to be producing. ""How can you be making 15 or 18% when everyone is making less money?"" Madoff said.
14
The Scheme
When clients sought to redeem their investments, Madoff funded the payouts with new capital, which he continued to attract through a reputation for unbelievable returns and by grooming his victims. Madoff cultivated an image of exclusivity, often initially turning clients away.
This model allowed roughly half of Madoff's investors to cash out at a profit. These investors have been required to pay into a victims' fund to compensate defrauded investors who lost money.
Madoff created a front of respectability and generosity, impressing investors with his activities on behalf of charities. In fact, many nonprofits were among his victims. About 10% of the money he swindled came from nonprofit organizations, according to the New York State Attorney General's Office.
15
Madoff's plausibility to investors was based on several factors:
His principal public portfolio appeared to stick to safe investments in blue-chip stocks.
He claimed to be using a
collar
strategy, also known as a split-strike conversion. A collar is a way of minimizing risk, protecting underlying shares by purchasing an out-of-the-money
put option
.
His returns were high (10 to 20% per annum) and consistent, but not outlandish. As the
Wall Street Journal
reported in a now-famous interview with Madoff, from 1992:
""[Madoff] insists the returns were really nothing special, given that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index generated an average annual return of 16.3% between November 1982 and November 1992. 'I would be surprised if anybody thought that matching the S&P over 10 years was anything outstanding,' he says.""
16
The Investigation
The
SEC
had been investigating Madoff and his securities firm off and on since 1992—a fact that frustrated many after he was finally prosecuted since it was felt that much of the damage could have been prevented if the initial investigations had been rigorous enough.
17
Financial analyst Harry Markopolos was one of the earliest
whistleblowers
. In 1999, he calculated in the space of an afternoon that Madoff had to be lying. He filed his first SEC complaint against Madoff in May 2000, but the regulator ignored him.
In a scathing 2005 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Markopolos wrote, ""Madoff Securities is the world's largest Ponzi Scheme. In this case, there is no SEC reward payment due to the whistle-blower so basically I'm turning this case in because it's the right thing to do.""
18
Important
Many felt that Madoff's worst damage could have been prevented if the SEC had been more rigorous in its initial investigations.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is an independent federal agency tasked with protecting investors and maintaining fair and efficient markets.
What Is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the federal agency that oversees investment offerings and financial markets. It is responsible for regulating
broker-dealers
,
investment advisors
,
exchanges
, and public companies to ensure that investors have accurate and transparent information. It also regulates the sale of securities, including
initial public offerings
.
Congress created the SEC in 1934 in response to the Great Depression. As the first federal regulator of the securities markets, the SEC was tasked with regulating the
bucket shops
and unethical trading practices that had contributed to the stock market crash of 1929.
Securities offered in the U.S. must be registered with the SEC before being sold to investors. Financial services firms such as broker-dealers, advisory firms, asset managers, and their professional representatives must also register with the SEC to do business.
Key Takeaways
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and protecting investors.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the SEC, mainly in response to the stock market crash of 1929 in the leadup to the Great Depression.
The SEC is responsible for regulating financial markets and approving securities for sale to the public.
The SEC brings civil action against those it alleges broke securities laws or regulations.
The SEC also refers criminal cases to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
Investopedia / Julie Bang
How the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Works
The SEC oversees organizations and individuals in the securities markets, including securities exchanges, brokerage firms, dealers,
registered investment advisors
, and investment funds. Through established securities rules and regulations, the SEC promotes disclosure and sharing of market-related information, fair dealing, and protection against fraud. It provides investors access to registration statements, periodic financial reports, and other securities forms through its electronic data-gathering, analysis, and retrieval database, better known as
EDGAR
.
1
Important
The SEC was created in 1934 to help restore investor confidence in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash.
2
The SEC is headed by five commissioners appointed by the president, one of whom is the chair. The commissioners have a five-year term, but may serve an additional 18 months until a replacement is found. Present SEC chair Paul Atkins took office in April 2025.
3
The law requires that no more than three of the five commissioners come from the same political party to promote nonpartisanship.

The SEC consists of five divisions and 23 offices.
5
Their goals are to interpret and
enforce securities laws
, issue new rules, oversee securities institutions, and coordinate regulations among different parts of the government. The five divisions and their roles are as follows:
Division of Corporate Finance:
Ensures investors are provided with material information (that is, relevant to a company's financial prospects or price) as they make investment decisions.
6
Division of Enforcement:
In charge of enforcing SEC regulations by investigating cases and bringing civil suits in federal court and administrative proceedings.
7
It also works with law enforcement agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), various states' investigatory units, the U.S. Secret Service, and other entities involved in uncovering financial fraud. When necessary, it refers cases to the DOJ for criminal prosecution.
Division of Investment Management:
Regulates investment companies
, variable insurance products, and federally registered investment advisors.
8
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis:
The SEC's economics and data analytics unit.
9
Division of Trading and Markets:
Establishes and maintains standards for fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
10
How the SEC Enforces Securities Law
Since the 1930s, the SEC has enforced securities laws and regulations through two primary mechanisms, often in conjunction with criminal cases brought by DOJ and other prosecutorial authorities:
Civil action in federal court:
The SEC initiates lawsuits in the U.S. District Court, seeking remedies like court orders to halt illegal activities, monetary fines, and the return of illicit profits. Federal judges preside over these cases, giving the defendant the right to a jury trial.
Administrative proceedings:
These are internal hearings conducted by administrative law judges within the SEC. Administrative actions can lead to injunctions against the activity about which the SEC has concerns, bans on working in the securities industry, financial penalties, and the repayment of profits from an unlawful enterprise.

In civil suits, the SEC seeks three main sanctions:
Injunctions:
Orders that prohibit future violations. A person or company that ignores an injunction is subject to fines or imprisonment for contempt.
Fines
:
Civil money penalties
Disgorgement of illegal profits:
In certain cases, the SEC may also seek a court order barring or suspending individuals from acting as corporate officers or directors.
Below is a table of the most common results of the SEC's successful enforcement actions:
Common SEC Enforcement Outcomes
Punishment
Description
Likely Forum
Purpose
Bans and Suspensions
The SEC can seek to bar or suspend individuals from working in the securities industry if they are found to have committed serious violations.
SEC Administrative Courts
Prevent further violations by removing bad actors from the industry.
Civil Fines
Monetary penalties are imposed on individuals or companies found to have violated securities laws. The severity of fines can range from thousands to millions of dollars.
Federal Court
Punish violators, deter future violations, and provide compensation for losses.
Compliance and Other Restorative Remedies
The SEC may require companies to carry out compliance programs or appoint independent monitors.
SEC Administrative Courts
It prevents a company from going under while working to ensure problem practices end.
Criminal Penalties
The SEC often works with the FBI, DOJ, and other agencies. The SEC's enforcement division can make criminal referrals, which the DOJ can pursue, leading to fines, imprisonment, and restitution.
State and Federal Courts
Punish severe misconduct, deter future violations, and provide justice for victims.
Disgorgement
This involves forcing violators to give up any ill-gotten gains from illegal activities.
SEC Administrative Courts
Prevent wrongdoers from profiting from their misconduct and restore victims' losses.
Injunctions
The SEC seeks court orders prohibiting individuals or companies from engaging in activities it believes are leading to securities violations.
SEC Administrative Courts
Stop ongoing illegal activities and prevent future misconduct.
The potential forums for the SEC's enforcement actions changed significantly following a June 2024 Supreme Court decision in SEC v. Jarkesy.
12
The court ruled that the SEC's practice of imposing civil penalties through administrative proceedings in cases of securities fraud violates the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. The decision requires the SEC to pursue such penalties in federal court, potentially affecting the rapidity and scope of its enforcement actions.
Thus, while the SEC can still pursue some administrative actions (those involving nonmonetary damages), cases involving civil penalties for securities fraud and similar matters (insider trading, accounting fraud, and market manipulation) must now be brought in federal court.
Criminal cases continue to be referred to law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, DOJ, and any relevant agencies in states where crimes are alleged to have occurred.
The SEC also serves as the first level of appeal for actions sought by the securities industry's self-regulatory organizations, such as
FINRA
or the New York Stock Exchange.

What Is Deferred Compensation?
Deferred compensation is part of an employee's regular compensation that is set aside to be paid at a later date, usually at
retirement
. In many cases, taxes on this income are deferred (postponed) until it is paid out. There are many forms of deferred compensation, including
retirement plans
,
pension plans
, and
stock-option
plans.
There are qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. While qualified deferred compensation plans are available to many employees,
non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plans
cater mainly to
high-income earners
who want to put away funds for retirement and find the company
401(k) plan
inadequate for their needs.
Key Takeaways
Employers use deferred compensation plans to incentivize prospective and current employees.
Deferred compensation can be structured as either qualified or non-qualified under federal regulations.
Some deferred compensation is made available only to top employees, such as executives.
A risk of deferred compensation in a non-qualified plan is that the employee can lose the money if the company goes bankrupt.
1
How Deferred Compensation Works
An employee may negotiate for deferred compensation because it offers immediate tax benefits. In many cases, the taxes due on the income is deferred until the compensation is paid out, often when the employee reaches retirement age.
2
3
If employees expect to be in a lower
tax bracket
when retiring, they have a chance to reduce their tax burden.
Roth 401(k)
s are an exception, as they require the employee to pay taxes on income as it is earned. The balance in a Roth account is, however, normally tax-free when it is withdrawn.
4
It can be a better option for people who expect to be in a higher tax bracket when they retire.
Types of Deferred Compensation
There are two broad categories of deferred compensation: qualified and non-qualified. These differ in their legal treatment and the purpose they serve.

Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans
Qualified deferred compensation plans are governed by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
, a key set of federal regulations for retirement plans.
5
They include 401(k) plans and many
403(b) plans
.
6
7
Funds in qualified deferred compensation plans are for the sole benefit of their recipients. Creditors cannot access the funds if the company goes
bankrupt
. Contributions to the plans are capped by law.
8
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans
Non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plans are contractual agreements between employers and participants. Also known as
409(a) plans
or, in some cases,
golden handcuffs
, NQDCs take different forms, including bonus plans, equity (
stock
) arrangements, and
supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs)
, otherwise known as ""
top hat plans
.""
9
10
NQDC plans have no caps on contributions and are typically offered only to top-level employees and key talent that the company wants to retain. Independent contractors are eligible for NQDC plans.
11
(This isn't the case with qualified deferred compensation plans.)
Compensation is usually paid out when the employee retires, although there can be provisions for earlier payouts in case of certain events like a change in ownership of the company or a strictly-defined emergency. Depending on the terms of the contract, deferred compensation might be canceled by the company if the employee is fired, defects to a competitor, or otherwise forfeits the benefit.
From the participant's perspective, NQDC plans offer a reduced tax burden and a retirement savings bonus. This is especially valued by
highly compensated employees
because qualified 401(k) plans have annual contribution limits.
12
On the downside, the money in NQDC plans does not have the same protection as a 401(k) balance. If the company goes bankrupt, creditors can seize funds from NQDC plans.
10
For some companies, NQDC plans are a way to hire expensive talent without having to pay their full compensation immediately, meaning they can postpone funding the obligations. That approach, however, can be a gamble for the employee.
Important
The employee pays
Social Security
and
Medicare taxes
on the deferred income at the time of the deferral but does not pay
income tax
on it until the funds are actually received.
13
Deferred Compensation vs. 401(k)
A deferred compensation plan is generally an addition to a company 401(k) plan and may be offered only to a few executives and other key employees as an incentive. Generally, those employees participate in both plans. They max out their contributions to the company 401(k) while enjoying the bonus of a deferred compensation plan.
That said, a 401(k) plan that includes a matching contribution from an employer is technically a form of deferred compensation. It's part of a regular salary that is payable only after the employee leaves the company or retires, much like a type of non-qualified deferred compensation called a ""
golden parachute
"", which is reserved for highly-compensated employees.
9
However, the 401(k) is a qualified plan, meaning the employer must stick to federal regulations that ensure the integrity of such plans. Non-qualifying plans are less regulated.
Advantages of Deferred Compensation
Unlike 401(k)s or
individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
, there are no contribution limits to a deferred compensation plan. An eligible employee can, for example, earmark an annual bonus as retirement savings.
The money in both of these plans can grow tax-free until it is withdrawn. (The big exception is the Roth 401(k) or
Roth IRA
, where contributions are taxed when they are made and no further taxes are due on withdrawals.)
14
7
The absence of contribution limits can add a great deal of value to a deferred compensation plan for a highly-paid employee.
The plans also offer tax-deferred growth and a tax deduction for the period that the contributions are made.
Pros
No limits on contributions
Tax-deferred asset growth
Current-period tax deduction
Cons
Balances are not protected in case of company bankruptcy
The money is not available until retirement
No way to borrow against balance
There are, however, some drawbacks.
Disadvantages of Deferred Compensation
With a deferred compensation plan, you are effectively a creditor of the company, lending the company the salary you have deferred. If the company declares bankruptcy in the future, you can lose some or all of this money.
1
Even if the company remains solid, your money is locked up, in many cases, until retirement, meaning that you cannot access it easily.
Depending on the plan's structure, you also may find yourself with limited investment options. It may include only the company's stock, for example.
Unlike with a 401(k) plan, when funds are received from a deferred compensation plan they cannot be rolled over into an IRA account.
15
Is Deferred Compensation a Good Idea?
Nobody turns down a bonus, and that's what deferred compensation typically is.
A rare exception might be if an employee feels that the salary offer for a job is inadequate and merely looks sweeter when the deferred compensation is added in. In particular, a younger employee might be unimpressed with a bonus that won't be paid until decades down the road.
In any case, the downside is that deferred compensation cannot be accessed for years, normally until the employee retires.
For most employees, saving for retirement via a company's 401(k) is most appropriate. However, high-income employees may want to defer a greater amount of their income for retirement than the limits imposed by a 401(k) or IRA.
How Is Deferred Compensation Paid Out?
The distribution date may be at retirement or after a specified number of years. This must be designated at the time the plan is set up and typically cannot be changed.
It is generally better for the employee if the deferred income is distributed over several years. A large single payout can push the recipient into a higher tax bracket for the year.
Note that distributions cannot be rolled into a qualified retirement plan. That means the taxes are due for that year.
How Does Deferred Compensation Affect Your Taxes?
In a non-Roth scenario, those making contributions to a plan enjoy a
tax deduction
in that year.
The funds grow tax-deferred until the payout date.
If you retire in a lower tax bracket or a
lower-tax jurisdiction
, you will benefit from the tax deferral upon retirement.
The Bottom Line
Though a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution is technically a type of deferred compensation, most people are typically referring to the non-qualified form when they talk about deferred compensation.
Financial advisors usually suggest you only use a non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan after you've made the maximum possible contribution to your 401(k)—and only if your employer is very solid financially, because NQDC plans are not strictly regulated and your funds may not be protected in the case of company bankruptcy.
10
Deferred compensation plans are non-qualified, meaning they don't have to follow certain federal regulations. Tread carefully.

Definition
Real estate is property that consists of land and any permanent structures or improvements on it or made to it.
What Is Real Estate?
Real estate is defined as the land and any permanent structures, like a home, or improvements attached to the land, whether natural or artificial.
Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.
Key Takeaways
Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached to it or built on it, whether natural or artificial.
There are five main categories of real estate, which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use.
Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, a rental property, or land.
Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment.
Understanding Real Estate
The terms
land
,
real estate
, and
real property
are often used interchangeably, but there are distinctions.
Land
refers to the earth's surface down to the center of the planet, including the trees, minerals, and water. The physical characteristics of land include its immobility, indestructibility, and uniqueness, where each parcel of land differs geographically.
Real estate encompasses the land, plus any permanent artificial additions, such as houses and other buildings. Any additions or changes to the land that affect the property's value are called an improvement.
Once land is improved, the total capital and labor used to build the improvement represent a sizable fixed investment. Though a building can be razed, improvements like drainage, electricity, water, and sewer systems tend to be permanent.
Real property includes the land and additions to the land, plus the rights inherent to its ownership and usage.
Real Estate Agent
A real estate agent is a licensed professional who arranges real estate transactions, matching buyers and sellers and acting as their representatives in negotiations.
What Are Types of Real Estate?
Residential real estate
:
Any property used for residential purposes. Examples include single-family homes, condos, cooperatives, duplexes, townhouses, and multifamily residences.
Commercial real estate
:
Any property used exclusively for business purposes, such as apartment complexes, gas stations, grocery stores, hospitals, hotels, offices, parking facilities, restaurants, shopping centers, stores, and theaters.
Industrial real estate
:
Any property used for manufacturing, production, distribution, storage, and research and development.
Land
:
Includes
undeveloped property
, vacant land, and agricultural lands such as farms, orchards, ranches, and timberland.
Special purpose
:
Property used by the public, such as cemeteries, government buildings, libraries, parks, places of worship, and schools.
The Economics of Real Estate
Real estate is a critical driver of economic growth in the U.S.
Housing starts
, the number of new residential construction projects in any given month, released by the U.S. Census Bureau, is a key economic indicator. The report includes building permits, housing starts, and housing completions data for single-family homes, homes with two to four units, and multifamily buildings with five or more units, such as apartment complexes.
1
Investors and analysts keep a close eye on housing starts because the numbers can provide a general sense of economic direction. Moreover, the
types
of new housing starts can give clues about how the economy is developing.
If housing starts indicate fewer single-family and more multifamily starts, it could signal an impending supply shortage for single-family homes, driving up home prices. The following chart shows 20 years of housing starts, from Jan. 1, 2000, to Feb. 1, 2020.

How to Invest in Real Estate
Some of the most common ways to invest in real estate include homeownership,
investment or rental properties
, and house flipping. One type of real estate investor is a real estate wholesaler who contracts a home with a seller, then finds an interested party to buy it. Real estate wholesalers typically find and contract distressed properties, but they don't perform any renovations or additions.
The earnings from investing in real estate are generated from rent or leases, as well as an appreciation of the real estate's value. Real estate is dramatically affected by its location, and factors such as employment rates, the local economy, crime rates, transportation facilities, school quality, municipal services, and property taxes can affect the value of the real estate.
Pros
Offers steady income
Offers capital appreciation
Diversifies portfolio
Can be bought with leverage
Cons
Is usually illiquid
Highly influenced by local factors
Requires large initial capital outlay
May require active management and expertise
Investing in real estate indirectly is done through a
real estate investment trust
(REIT), a company that holds a portfolio of income-producing real estate. There are several types of REITs, including equity, mortgage, and hybrid REITs, which are classified based on how their shares are bought and sold. These classifications include publicly-traded REITs, public non-traded REITs, and private REITs.
The most popular way to invest in a REIT is to purchase shares that are publicly traded on a stock exchange. The shares trade like any other security traded on an exchange, making REITs very liquid and transparent. Income from REITs is earned through dividend payments and appreciation of the shares. In addition to individual REITs, investors can trade in real estate mutual funds and real estate exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Another option for investing in real estate is through mortgage-backed securities (MBS), such as the Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (
VMBS
), which comprises federal agency-backed MBS with a minimum pool size of $1 billion and a minimum maturity of one year.
3
The iShares MBS ETF (
MBB
) focuses on fixed-rate mortgage securities and tracks the Bloomberg U.S. MBS Index. Its holdings include bonds issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
4
Pros
Liquidity
Diversification
Steady dividends
Risk-adjusted returns
Cons
Low growth/low capital appreciation
Not tax-advantaged
Subject to market risk
High fees
Warning
Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take.
5
One such step is to file a report to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
or with the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD).
What Are the Best Ways to Finance a Real Estate Investment?
Real estate is commonly purchased with cash or financed with a mortgage through a private or commercial lender.
What Is Real Estate Development?
Real estate development, also known as property development, encompasses a range of activities that span from renovating existing buildings to acquiring raw land and selling developed land or parcels to others.
What Careers are Common in the Real Estate Industry?
Common careers found in the real estate industry include leasing agent,
foreclosure
specialist, title examiner, home inspector, real estate appraiser, real estate agent, and mortgage broker.
The Bottom Line
Real estate is land, any buildings or improvements on it, and any natural resources. There are various types of real estate, including commercial, land, industrial, and residential properties. You can own real estate or invest in it through real estate investment trusts, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds.

Definition
Systematic sampling happens when a random sample is selected from a larger population at a regular interval.
What Is Systematic Sampling?
Systematic sampling is a probability
sampling
method where samples from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This sampling interval is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
Key Takeaways
Systematic sampling is when you select a random sample from a larger population with a fixed periodic interval.
The fixed periodic interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
Advantages of this methodology include eliminating the phenomenon of clustered selection and a low probability of contaminating data.
Disadvantages include overrepresentation or underrepresentation of particular patterns and a greater risk of data manipulation.
There are three main types of systematic samples: random systematic samples, linear systematic samples, and circular systematic samples.
Nez Riaz / Investopedia
Understanding Systematic Sampling
When carried out correctly on a large population of a defined size, systematic sampling can help researchers, including
marketing
and sales professionals, obtain representative findings on a huge group of people without having to reach out to each and every one of them.
Since
simple random sampling
of a population can be inefficient and time-consuming,
statisticians
turn to other methods, such as systematic sampling. Choosing a sample size through a systematic approach can be done quickly. Once a fixed starting point has been identified, a constant interval is selected to facilitate participant selection.
Systematic sampling is preferable to simple random sampling when there is a low risk of data manipulation. If such a risk is high when a researcher can manipulate the interval length to obtain desired results, then a simple random sampling technique would be more appropriate.
Systematic sampling is popular with researchers and analysts because of its simplicity. Researchers generally assume the results are representative of most normal
populations
unless a random characteristic disproportionately exists with every nth data sample (which is unlikely). In other words, a population needs to exhibit a natural degree of randomness along with the chosen metric. If the population has a type of standardized pattern, then the risk of accidentally choosing very common cases is more apparent.
Within systematic sampling, as with other sampling methods, a target population must be selected prior to selecting participants. A population can be identified based on any number of desired characteristics that suit the purpose of the study being conducted. Some selection criteria may include age, gender, race, location, education level, or profession.
Important
There are several methods of sampling a population for statistical inference. Systematic sampling is one form of random sampling.
When To Use Systematic Sampling
One situation where systematic sampling may be best suited is when the population being studied exhibits a degree of order or regularity. For example, if you’re surveying customers entering a store, systematic sampling allows you to systematically select every nth customer, ensuring representation across different times of the day or week. This approach helps to avoid bias that may arise from selecting only customers who arrive during specific periods.
Another scenario where systematic sampling can work well is when the population size is known and relatively large. Instead of having to list and randomly select individuals from the entire population, systematic sampling simplifies the process by selecting samples at a set cadence. This is particularly useful in large-scale studies where time and resources are limited, meaning you don’t need to spend a large amount of energy planning out the sample.
Systematic sampling can be used when researchers want to ensure that the sample is evenly spread across the entire population. For example, a company could select every nth person from the company directory filtered by last name. Other forms of sampling may accidentally cluster similar populations (i.e., too many people from finance are selected based on how the sample is aggregated).
Additionally, systematic sampling offers the advantage of simplicity and ease of implementation compared to other sampling methods. It requires minimal computation and can be easily executed using simple
algorithms
, especially if the target sample size and total population size are known.
Steps To Create a Systematic Sample
You can use the following steps to create a systematic sample:
1
Define your population
:
This is the group from which you are sampling.
Settle on a sample size
:
How many subjects do you want/need to sample from the population?
Assign every member of the population a number
: If the group you’re looking at consists of, say, 10,000 people, start lining them up and giving them numbers.
Decide the sampling interval
:
This can be achieved by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
Choose a starting point
:
This can be done by selecting a random number.
Identify members of your sample
:
If you have a starting point of 15 and a sample interval of 100, the first member of the sample would be 115, and so forth.
Examples of Systematic Sampling
As a hypothetical example of systematic sampling, assume that, in a population of 10,000 people, a statistician selects every 100th person for sampling. The sampling intervals can also be systematic, such as choosing a new sample to draw from every 12 hours.
As another example, if you wanted to select a random group of 1,000 people from a population of 50,000 using systematic sampling, all the potential participants must be placed on a list and a starting point would be selected. Once the list is formed, every 50th person on the list (starting the count at the selected starting point) would be chosen as a participant, since 50,000 ÷ 1,000 = 50.
For example, if the selected starting point was 20, the 60th person on the list would be chosen followed by the 120th, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached and if additional participants are required, the count loops to the beginning of the list to finish the count.
Fast Fact
To conduct systematic sampling, you must first know the size of the target population.
Types of Systematic Sampling
Generally, there are three ways to generate a systematic sample: systematic random sampling, linear systematic sampling, and circular systematic sampling.
Systematic Random Sampling
This is the classic form of systematic sampling where the subject is selected at a predetermined interval. For example, if a researcher wants to select a sample of 100 students from a population of 1,000, they could use systematic random sampling by selecting every 10th student from a list sorted in random order. This approach ensures that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, while still maintaining a systematic sampling pattern.
Linear Systematic Sampling
Rather than randomly selecting the sampling interval, this is when a skip pattern is created following a linear path. This means that instead of selecting every nth member from the population, the selection process follows a predetermined sequence, such as selecting every fifth member, then every seventh member, then every ninth member, and so on. Linear systematic sampling can be useful in situations where there is a specific order or sequence to the population, such as geographical locations along a linear path.
Circular Systematic Sampling
This is when a sample starts again at the same point after ending. This means that once the sampling interval reaches the last member of the population, it wraps around to the beginning and continues the selection process. Circular systematic sampling is often used in situations where the population exhibits cyclical patterns or where there is no clear starting or ending point. For example, if researchers are studying tree growth in a forest, they could use circular systematic sampling by selecting trees at regular intervals along a circular path, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the forest area.
Systematic Sampling vs. Cluster Sampling

Investopedia,Heteroscedasticity Definition: Simple Meaning and Types Explained,"Close
What Is Heteroskedasticity?
In statistics, heteroskedasticity (or heteroscedasticity) happens when the standard deviations of a predicted variable, monitored over different values of an independent variable or as related to prior time periods, are non-constant. With heteroskedasticity, the tell-tale sign upon visual inspection of the residual errors is that they will tend to fan out over time, as depicted in the image below.
Heteroskedasticity often arises in two forms: conditional and unconditional. Conditional heteroskedasticity identifies nonconstant
volatility
related to prior period's (e.g., daily) volatility. Unconditional heteroskedasticity refers to general structural changes in volatility that are not related to prior period volatility. Unconditional heteroskedasticity is used when future periods of high and low volatility can be identified.

Key Takeaways
In statistics, heteroskedasticity (or heteroscedasticity) happens when the standard errors of a variable, monitored over a specific amount of time, are non-constant.
With heteroskedasticity, the tell-tale sign upon visual inspection of the residual errors is that they will tend to fan out over time, as depicted in the image above.
Heteroskedasticity is a violation of the assumptions for linear regression modeling, and so it can impact the validity of
econometric analysis
or financial models like CAPM.
Important
While heteroskedasticity does not cause bias in the coefficient estimates, it does make them less precise; lower precision increases the likelihood that the coefficient estimates are further from the correct population value.
The Basics of Heteroskedasticity
In finance, conditional heteroskedasticity is often seen in the prices of stocks and bonds.
The level of volatility
of these equities cannot be predicted over any period. Unconditional heteroskedasticity can be used when discussing variables that have identifiable seasonal variability, such as electricity usage.
As it relates to statistics, heteroskedasticity (also spelled
heteroscedasticity)
refers to the error variance, or dependence of scattering, within a minimum of one independent variable within a particular sample. These variations can be used to calculate the margin of error between data sets, such as expected results and actual results, as it provides a measure of the deviation of data points from the mean value.
For a dataset to be considered relevant, the majority of the data points must be within a particular number of standard deviations from the mean as described by Chebyshev’s theorem, also known as Chebyshev’s inequality. This provides guidelines regarding the probability of a random variable differing from the mean.

Based on the number of standard deviations specified, a random variable has a particular probability of existing within those points. For example, it may be required that a range of two standard deviations contain at least 75% of the data points to be considered valid. A common cause of variances outside the minimum requirement is often attributed to issues of data quality.
The opposite of heteroskedastic is
homoskedastic
. Homoskedasticity refers to a condition in which the variance of the residual term is constant or nearly so. Homoskedasticity is one assumption of linear regression modeling. It is needed to ensure that the estimates are accurate, that the prediction limits for the dependent variable are valid, and that confidence intervals and p-values for the parameters are valid.
The Types Heteroskedasticity
Unconditional
Unconditional heteroskedasticity is predictable and can relate to variables that are cyclical by nature. This can include higher retail sales reported during the traditional holiday shopping period or the increase in air conditioner repair calls during warmer months.
Changes within the variance can be tied directly to the occurrence of particular events or predictive markers if the shifts are not traditionally seasonal. This can be related to an increase in smartphone sales with the release of a new model as the activity is cyclical based on the event but not necessarily determined by the season.
Heteroskedasticity can also relate to cases where the data approach a boundary—where the variance must necessarily be smaller because of the boundary's restricting the range of the data.
Conditional
Conditional heteroskedasticity is not predictable by nature. There is no telltale sign that leads analysts to believe data will become more or less scattered at any point in time. Often, financial products are considered subject to conditional heteroskedasticity as not all changes can be attributed to specific events or seasonal changes.
A common application of conditional heteroskedasticity is to stock markets, where the volatility today is strongly related to volatility yesterday. This model explains periods of persistent high volatility and low volatility.
Special Considerations
Heteroskedasticity and Financial Modeling
Heteroskedasticity is an important concept in regression modeling, and in the investment world, regression models are used to explain the performance of securities and investment portfolios. The most well-known of these is the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
, which explains the performance of a stock in terms of its volatility relative to the market as a whole.
1
Extensions of this model have added other predictor variables such as size, momentum, quality, and style (value versus growth).
These predictor variables have been added because they explain or account for variance in the dependent variable. Portfolio performance is explained by CAPM. For example, developers of the CAPM model were aware that their model failed to explain an interesting anomaly: high-quality stocks, which were less volatile than low-quality stocks, tended to perform better than the CAPM model predicted. CAPM says that higher-risk stocks should outperform lower-risk stocks.
In other words, high-volatility stocks should beat lower-volatility stocks. But high-quality stocks, which are less volatile, tended to perform better than predicted by CAPM.
Later, other researchers extended the CAPM model (which had already been extended to include other predictor variables such as size, style, and momentum) to include quality as an additional predictor variable, also known as a ""factor."" With this factor now included in the model, the performance anomaly of low volatility stocks was accounted for. These models, known as
multi-factor models
, form the basis of factor investing and smart beta.

Pro rata is a term that describes the distribution or allocation of assets in equal portions.
What Is Pro Rata?
Pro rata is a Latin term that translates to ""in proportion."" Put simply, it is used to describe a proportionate allocation. It's a process in which an allocated asset is distributed in equal portions. An amount is assigned to one person according to their share of the whole if something is distributed to several people on a pro rata basis. A pro rata calculation is often used in business finance but can also determine the appropriate portions of any given whole.
Key Takeaways
Pro rata typically means that everyone gets their fair share.
It means proportionally, such as dividends awarded to investors based on their investment.
The concept of pro rata is rooted in fractions because proration attempts to make two fractions equal, but with different denominators.
The practice of prorating can be applied to billing for services, paying out dividends, or allocating business partnership income.
Pro rata is calculated by dividing the instance of an item by the maximum quantity of that item. This ratio can then be applied to any related item to find the same proportion.
Investopedia / Matthew Collins
Understanding Pro Rata
Pro rata typically means that each party or person receives their fair share in proportion to the whole. Pro rata calculations can be used in many areas, including determining
dividend
payments. These are cash payments by corporations made to shareholders.
Pro rata in the insurance industry is used to determine the amount of
premium
due for a policy that only covers a partial term. Allocating the appropriate portion of an annual interest rate to a shorter time frame can also be done on a pro rata basis.
Pro rata is also used to determine how much of a distribution from a qualified retirement account, such as an IRA, SEP, or
401(k)
, is taxable when the account contains before and after-tax dollars.
1
An account holder might have a 401(k) funded with 20% pre-tax dollars and 80% post-tax dollars. Withdrawals will consist of 20% taxable and 80% non-taxable money as a result.
How to Calculate Pro Rata
Pro rata is calculated based on three factors:

Advertiser Disclosure
×
The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
The number of items true, owned, or having been incurred.
The total quantity of that item or the maximum quantity possible.
The assigned quantity of a related item in the second factor above.
Pro Rata Share = Number of ""True"" Items ÷ Maximum Quantity Possible
Pro Rata Distribution = Pro Rata Share x Quantity of Related Item
Imagine an employee is set to receive a $10,000
bonus
this year. They'll receive a pro rata share of the bonus if they leave at any point. The employee leaves on March 20. The agreement awards the bonus based on the number of days worked, inclusive of the last day.
Divide the number of true items by the maximum quantity possible to calculate the pro rata share. The number of true items is the number of days worked. There are 79 days inclusive between January 1 and March 20, assuming it's not a leap year. The maximum number of days possible is 365.
Pro rata share = 79 ÷ 365 = 21.64%
Multiply the pro rata share by the related item to calculate the pro rata portion. The item we want to prorate is the annual bonus, in this case.
Pro rata distribution = 21.64% x $10,000 = $2,164
The employee will therefore receive a pro rata distribution of $2,164 by leaving on March 20, based on the prorated number of days worked for the year.
Fast Fact
Pro rata can be communicated as a percentage, such as a shareholder who owns a 10% share of the company's stock. It can also be expressed as a quantity, such as the shareholder who owns 100,000 of the company's one million shares.
Why Pro Rata Works
The mathematical concept of pro rata works because the proportion of one good is imposed on another. Pro rata entails taking a fraction of one item and conveying the same fraction on another base.
The root of pro rata is grounded in proportionally equal fractions with different denominators. The 79/365 fraction in our example is equal to the 2,164/10,000 fraction, ignoring rounding variances. Pro rata is, therefore, simply taking one fraction and finding its equal given a specific denominator. Pro rata attempts to solve for the numerator to make two fractions equal, given specific criteria.
Consider another example where you and a friend want to share four pieces of pizza proportionally. Each of you would receive 50% of the pizza if the slices were shared equally. This pro rata example is trying to determine which fraction with a denominator of four is equal to 1/2. Each of you gets two slices because 2/4 = 1/2.
Examples of Pro Rata
Pro Rata and Dividends Per Shareholder
Each investor is paid according to their holdings when a company pays dividends to its shareholders. The total amount of dividends paid would be $200 if a company has 100
shares outstanding
and issues a dividend of $2 per share. The total dividend payments can't exceed this limit, no matter how many shareholders there are. The pro rata calculation must be used to determine the appropriate portion of that $200 whole due to each shareholder.
Assume there are only four shareholders. They hold 50, 25, 15, and 10 shares, respectively. The amount due to each shareholder is their pro rata share. This is calculated by dividing the ownership of each person by the total number of shares and then multiplying the resulting fraction by the total amount of the dividend payment.
The
majority shareholder's
portion is therefore (50 ÷ 100) x $200 = $100. This makes sense because the shareholder owns half the shares and receives half the total dividends. The remaining shareholders get $50, $30, and $20, respectively.
Important
Be mindful of situations where weight isn't given to individuals. Every American citizen eligible to vote can cast a tally equal to every other citizen, regardless of their age, income, or any other factor. The pro rata value of the vote is equal to one divided by the total population that votes in this example.
Pro Rata for Insurance Premiums
Another common use is to determine the amount due for a partial
insurance
policy term. Most insurance policies are based on a 12-month term, so the insurance company must prorate the annual premium to determine the amount owed if a policy is needed for a shorter term. Divide the total premium by the number of days in a standard term and multiply by the number of days covered by the truncated policy to do this.
Assume an auto policy that typically covers a full year carries a premium of $1,000. The company must reduce the premium accordingly if the insured only requires the policy for 270 days. The pro rata premium due for this period is ($1,000 ÷ 365) x 270 = $739.73.
Pro Rata for Interest Rates
Pro rata calculations are also used to determine the amount of interest that will be earned on an investment. The pro rata amount earned for a shorter period is calculated by dividing the total amount of interest by the number of months in a year and multiplying by the number of months in the truncated period if an investment earns an annual interest rate. The amount of interest earned in two months on an investment that yields 10% interest each year is (10% ÷ 12) x 2 = 1.67%.
Payment on
accrued interest
on bonds is calculated on a pro rata basis. Accrued interest is the total interest that has accumulated on a bond since its last coupon payment. The bondholder is still entitled to the interest that accrues up until the time the bond is sold if they sell the bond before the next coupon date. The bond buyer, not the issuer, is responsible for paying the bond seller the accrued interest, which is added to the market price of the bond.

An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is an employee benefit plan that gives workers ownership interest in the company in the form of shares of stock.
What Is an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)?
An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) gives the sponsoring company—the selling
shareholder
—and participants various tax benefits. It's a
qualified retirement plan
. Employers often use them as a
corporate finance
strategy to align the interests of their employees with those of their shareholders.
An ESOP is usually formed to facilitate succession planning in a closely held company by allowing employees the opportunity to buy shares of the corporate
stock
. ESOPs are also offered as a
retirement
benefit.
Key Takeaways
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is an employee benefit that gives workers ownership interest in the company in the form of shares of stock.
ESOPs encourage employees to give their all as the company’s success translates into financial rewards.
They also help staff to feel more appreciated and better compensated for the work they do.
Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to vesting, which gives employees rights to employer-provided assets over time.
Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin
How Does an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Work?
ESOPs are set up as
trust funds
. They can be funded by companies putting newly-issued shares in them, by putting cash in to buy existing company shares, or by borrowing money through the entity to buy company shares. ESOPs are used by companies of all sizes, including a number of large, publicly traded corporations.
Companies with an ESOP must not discriminate and are required to appoint a trustee to act as the plan
fiduciary
.
Advantages of ESOPs
Since ESOP shares are part of the employee’s
remuneration
package, companies can use ESOPs to keep plan participants focused on corporate performance and share price appreciation.

Employees, meanwhile, are presented with a way to make more money, increase their compensation, and essentially be rewarded for their hard work and commitment.
Important
ESOPs incentivize employees to give their all and thus can favor all parties.
ESOP Up-Front Costs and Distributions
Companies often provide employees with such ownership with no up-front costs. The company may hold the provided shares in a trust for safety and growth until the employee retires or parts ways with the company.
Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to
vesting
, which gives employees rights to employer-provided assets over time. Typically, they earn an increasing proportion of shares for each year of their service.
Warning
Vesting can happen immediately, after a certain number of years (cliff), or gradually over time (graded).
When a
fully-vested
employee retires or leaves the company, the firm “purchases” the vested shares back from them. The money goes to the employee in a lump sum or equal periodic payments, depending on the plan.
Once the company purchases the shares and pays the employee, the company redistributes or voids the shares. Employees who leave the company voluntarily cannot take the shares of stock with them, only the cash payment.
How to Cash Out of an ESOP
Being vested doesn’t necessarily mean you can cash out of your ESOP. Generally, it’s only possible to redeem these shares if you terminate employment, retire, die, or become disabled.
Age is often an important factor. Distributions are rarely permitted to people under 59½, or 55 if they have left the company. Distributions before these ages are subject to a 10%
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
penalty. Specific information about how to cash out of an ESOP can be found in the terms listed in the plan’s guidelines.

Fast Fact
Some ESOPs may distribute
dividend
payments to employees who are still at the company. Other in-service distributions may be done by some plans as well.
Other Forms of Employee Ownership
Stock ownership plans provide packages that act as additional employee benefits. Other versions of employee ownership include direct-purchase programs, stock options,
restricted stock
,
phantom stock
, and stock appreciation rights.
Direct stock purchase plan
(DSPP) lets employees purchase shares of their companies with after-tax money. Some companies provide small discounts on the price of the stock as well. Tax-qualified plans are also sometimes offered.
Restricted stock
gives employees the right to receive shares as a gift or a purchased item after meeting particular restrictions, such as working for a specific period or hitting specific performance targets.
Stock options
provide employees the opportunity to buy shares at a fixed price during a specified time period known as the exercise window.
Phantom stock
provides
cash bonuses
for good performance. These bonuses equate to the value of a particular number of shares.
Stock appreciation rights
compensate employees based on how much the company's stock has appreciated in a given period.
What Does ESOP Stand for?
ESOP stands for employee stock ownership plan. An ESOP grants company stock to employees, often based on the duration of their employment. Typically, it is part of a compensation package, where shares will vest over a period of time. ESOPs are designed so that employees’ motivations and interests are aligned with those of the company’s shareholders. From a management perspective, ESOPs have certain tax advantages, along with incentivizing employees to focus on company performance.
How Does an ESOP Work?
First, an ESOP is set up as a trust fund. Here, companies may place newly-issued shares, borrow money to buy company shares, or fund the trust with cash to purchase company shares. Meanwhile, employees can accumulate a growing number of shares, an amount that can rise over time depending on their employment term. These shares are meant to be sold only at or after the time of retirement or employment termination. The employee is remunerated by receiving the cash value of their shares.
What Is an Example of an ESOP?
Consider an employee who has worked at a large tech firm for five years. Under the company’s ESOP, they have the right to receive 20 shares after the first year, and 100 shares total after five years. When the employee retires, they will receive the share value in cash. Other types of stock ownership plans may be offered instead of an ESOP. They include stock options, restricted shares, and stock appreciation rights, among others.
Are ESOPs Good for Employees?
Yes, ESOPs can generally be considered a benefit for workers. These programs tend to be adopted by companies that don’t change staff frequently. They often result in a bigger payout for employees.
The Bottom Line
ESOPs are generally a win-win for employers and employees, encouraging greater effort and commitment in exchange for bigger financial rewards. However, they are complex and can be difficult to understand.
Not all ESOPs are the same. Rules on actions such as vesting and withdrawals can vary. It’s important to be aware of them to make the most of this benefit and not potentially miss out on an extra bonus.

What Is a Letter of Intent (LOI)?
A letter of intent (LOI) is a document declaring the preliminary commitment of one party to do business with another. The letter outlines the chief terms of a prospective deal. Commonly used in major business transactions, LOIs are similar in content to
term sheets
. However, LOIs are presented in letter formats, while term sheets are structured as lists.
1
Key Takeaways
A letter of intent (LOI) is a document declaring the preliminary commitment of one party to do business with another.
An LOI outlines the chief terms of a prospective deal and is commonly used in business transactions.
LOIs are useful when two parties are initially brought together to determine the broad strokes of a deal before they resolve its finer points.
Terms included in an LOI are certain stipulations, requirements, timelines, and the parties involved.
Many LOIs include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and no-solicitation provisions.
Letters of intent are also used outside of the business world when two parties intend to work together or form a deal.
Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight
Understanding a Letter of Intent (LOI)
LOIs are useful when two parties are initially brought together to hammer out the broad strokes of a transaction before the finer points are resolved. LOIs often include provisions stating that a deal may only go through if financing has been secured by one or both parties, or that it may be cancelled if papers are not signed by a certain date.
Important
Since LOIs typically discuss potential points of deals that have yet to be cemented, they are almost universally intended to be
non-binding
.
LOIs can be iterative in nature. One party may present an LOI, to which the other party may either counter with a tweaked version of that LOI or draft a new document altogether. Ideally, by the time both parties come together to formalize a deal, there will be no surprises on either side of the table.
Many LOIs include
non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)
, which contractually stipulate the components of a deal both parties agree to keep confidential, and which details may be shared publicly. Many LOIs also feature no-solicitation provisions, which forbid one party from poaching the other party's employees.
A letter of intent is usually drafted and signed while negotiations between parties are ongoing so that the final terms of a deal might vary from what was agreed upon in the LOI.
Due diligence
is conducted by both parties before doing business. It is a prudent business practice to complete due diligence before signing an LOI.

Purpose of a Letter of Intent (LOI)
An LOI may be used by different parties for many purposes. Parties can use an LOI to outline some of the basic, fundamental terms of an agreement before they negotiate and finalize all the details. Furthermore, the LOI may be used to signal that two parties are negotiating a deal, such as a merger or
joint venture (JV)
.
Overall, LOIs aim to achieve the following:
Clarify which key points of a deal must be negotiated.
Protect all parties involved in the deal.
Announce the nature of the deal, such as a joint venture or a
merger
between two companies.
Applications of a Letter of Intent (LOI)
In the context of business deals, LOIs are typically drafted by a company's legal team, which outlines the details of the intended action. For example, in the
merger and acquisitions (M&A)
process, LOIs detail whether a firm plans to take over another company with cash or through a stock deal.
Letters of intent also have applications beyond the business world. For example, parents may use them to express the expectations they have for their children in the event both parents die. Although they aren't legal documents (like wills), LOIs may be considered by family court judges responsible for legislating what happens to the children under such circumstances.
LOIs are also used by those seeking
government grants
and by highly sought-after high school varsity athletes. These individuals frequently draft LOIs to declare their commitments to attend particular colleges or universities.
What Is the Purpose of a Letter of Intent to Purchase?
A letter of intent to purchase is a document that expresses a buyer's serious interest in purchasing a business. A letter of intent to purchase may also be called a letter of interest. Some of the main points included in a letter of intent to purchase include the purchase price, terms of payment, and the timeline for completing the sale.
What Is the Alternative to a Letter of Intent?
A letter of intent lays out the basics of a business deal, including cost, time frame, and any conditions that must be met for the deal to go through. Like an LOI, a
memorandum of understanding (MOU)
is a document declaring the preliminary commitment of one party to do business with another. The main difference between these two documents is that an LOI is not typically legally binding while an MOU is considered binding in some cases and it carries weight in a court of law.
What Are the 3 Purposes of Writing a Letter of Intert?
Two parties expected to engage in a business deal may use a letter of intent (LOI) to begin a conversation about the transaction. It is intended to show each party's serious commitment to the terms of the deal. It is also used to clarify the meaning and intent of the transaction.
The Bottom Line
Letters of intent (LOIs) are used in the business world when two parties intend to work together or form a deal. The purpose of an LOI is to clarify which key points of a deal must be negotiated, protect all parties involved in the deal, and announce the nature of the deal, such as a joint venture or a merger between two companies. Sometimes LOIs are used outside the business world. They may be used by those seeking government grants or by highly sought-after high school varsity athletes.

The accounting equation is a core concept of modern accounting that states that a company's assets are the sum of its liabilities and its shareholder equity.
What Is the Accounting Equation?
The accounting equation is a fundamental concept that states that a company’s total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and its shareholders’ equity. This straightforward relationship between assets, liabilities, and equity is the foundation of the
double-entry
accounting system.
The accounting equation ensures that the balance sheet remains balanced. Each entry made on the debit side has a corresponding entry or coverage on the credit side.
The accounting equation is also known as the basic accounting equation or the balance sheet equation.
Key Takeaways
The accounting equation is considered to be the foundation of the double-entry accounting system.
It shows on a company’s balance sheet that a company’s total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and shareholders’ equity.
Assets represent the valuable resources controlled by a company and the liabilities represent its obligations.
Both liabilities and shareholders’ equity show how the assets of a company are financed.
Financing through debt shows as a liability and financing through issuing equity shares appears in shareholders’ equity.
Daniel Fishel / Investopedia
How the Accounting Equation Works
The financial position of any business is based on two key components of the
balance sheet
: assets and liabilities. Owners’ equity or shareholders’ equity is the third section of the balance sheet. The accounting equation is a representation of how these three important components are associated with each other.
Assets represent the valuable resources controlled by a company and liabilities represent its obligations. Both liabilities and shareholders’ equity detail how the assets of a company are financed. It will show as a liability if it’s financed through debt but in shareholders' equity if it’s financed through issuing
equity
shares to investors.

Important
The accounting equation helps to assess whether business transactions carried out by the company are being accurately reflected in its books and accounts.
Assets
Assets include
cash and cash equivalents
or
liquid assets
. These may include Treasury bills and certificates of deposit (CDs).
Accounts receivable
lists the amounts of money owed to the company by its customers for the sale of its products. Inventory is also considered to be an asset.
The major and often largest value assets of most companies are their machinery, buildings, and property. These are fixed assets that are usually held for many years.
Liabilities
Liabilities are debts that a company owes and costs that it must pay to keep running. Debt is a liability whether it's a long-term loan or a bill that's due to be paid. Costs can include rent, taxes, utilities, salaries, wages, and
dividends
payable.
Shareholders’ Equity
The shareholders’ equity number is a company’s total assets minus its total liabilities. It can be defined as the total number of dollars that a company would have left if it liquidated all its assets and paid off all of its liabilities. This would then be distributed to the shareholders.
Retained earnings
are part of shareholders’ equity. This number is the sum of total earnings that weren't paid to shareholders as dividends.
Think of retained earnings as savings. It represents the total profits that have been saved and put aside or “retained” for future use.
Accounting Equation Formula and Calculation
The balance sheet holds the elements that contribute to the accounting equation:
1
Locate the company’s total assets on the balance sheet for the period.
Total all liabilities which should be a separate listing on the balance sheet.
Locate total shareholders’ equity and add the number to total liabilities.
Total assets will equal the sum of liabilities and total equity.
Assets
=
(
Liabilities
+
Owner’s Equity
)
\text{Assets}=(\text{Liabilities}+\text{Owner's Equity})
Assets
=
(
Liabilities
+
Owner’s Equity
)
Say leading retailer XYZ Corp reported the following on its balance sheet for its latest full
fiscal year
:
Total assets: $170 billion
Total liabilities: $120 billion
Total shareholders’ equity: $50 billion
We arrive at ($50 billion + $120 billion) = $170 billion if we calculate the right side of the accounting equation (equity + liabilities). This matches the value of the assets reported by the company.
What Is the Purpose of the Double-Entry System?
The accounting equation is a concise expression of the complex, expanded, and multi-item display of a balance sheet. The representation essentially equates all uses of capital or assets to all sources of capital where debt capital leads to liabilities and equity capital leads to shareholders’ equity.
Every business transaction will be represented in at least two of its accounts if a company is keeping accurate accounts. The borrowed money will be reflected in its balance sheet as both an increase in the company’s assets and an increase in its loan liability if a business takes a loan from a bank.
It will result in an increase in the company’s
inventory
which is an asset while reducing cash capital which is another asset if a business buys
raw materials
and pays in cash. Two or more accounts are affected by every transaction carried out by a company so the accounting system is referred to as double-entry accounting.
The double-entry practice ensures that the accounting equation always remains balanced. The left-side value of the equation will always match the right-side value. The total amount of all assets will always equal the sum of liabilities and shareholders’ equity.
2
The global adherence to the double-entry accounting system makes the account-keeping and -tallying processes more standardized and foolproof.
The accounting equation ensures that all entries in the books and records are vetted and a verifiable relationship exists between each liability or expense and its corresponding source or between each item of income or asset and its source.
Limits of the Accounting Equation
The balance sheet always balances out but the accounting equation can’t tell investors how well a company is performing. Investors must interpret the numbers and decide for themselves whether the company has too many or too few liabilities, not enough assets or perhaps too many assets, or whether its financing is sufficient to ensure its long-term growth.
Real-World Example of the Accounting Equation
This is a portion of Exxon Mobil Corp.’s (
XOM
) balance sheet in millions as of March 31, 2024:
Total assets were $377,918
Total liabilities were $164,866
Total equity was $213,052
3
The accounting equation is calculated as follows:
$164,866 (total liabilities) + $213,052 (equity) = $377,918 (which equals the total assets for the period)
Why Is the Accounting Equation Important?
The accounting equation captures the relationship between the three components of a balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity. A company’s equity will increase when its assets increase and vice versa. Adding liabilities will decrease equity and reducing liabilities such as by paying off debt will increase equity. These basic concepts are essential to modern accounting methods.
What Are the 3 Elements of the Accounting Equation?
The three elements of the accounting equation are assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity. The formula is straightforward: A company’s total assets are equal to its liabilities plus its shareholders’ equity. The double-entry bookkeeping system is designed to accurately reflect a company’s total assets.
What Is an Asset in the Accounting Equation?
An
asset
is anything with economic value that a company controls and can be used to benefit the business now or in the future. Assets include fixed assets such as machinery and buildings as well as financial assets such as investments in stocks and bonds. They may also be intangible assets like patents, trademarks, and goodwill.
What Is a Liability in the Accounting Equation?
A company’s
liabilities
include every debt it has incurred. These may include loans, accounts payable, mortgages, deferred revenues, bond issues, warranties, and accrued expenses.

Investopedia,Liquidity Coverage Ratio: Definition and How To Calculate,"Close
Definition
Mandated by the Basel Accords, the liquidity coverage ratio is the amount of liquid assets that financial institutions must have on hand to ensure they can meet their short-term obligations in the event of market turmoil.
Just like you might keep aside money for three to six months of expenses in case of unexpected emergencies, banks must maintain a stockpile of easily accessible assets to weather financial storms. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, was proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a group of central bankers and regulators from the world's major financial centers.
""The goal is to ensure that banks hold enough highly liquid assets to cover outflows of cash during a crisis,"" Laurence Ball, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, told Investopedia. ""The 2008 crises at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, etc., occurred because they ran out of cash due to a number of liquidity drains.""
These events led regulators to require banks to hold enough cash-like assets to survive 30 days of market chaos. The international standard, implemented in the U.S. by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2014, is one of the most significant reforms to emerge from the global financial crisis.

Key Takeaways
The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) acts as banks' financial safety net, requiring them to maintain enough easily sellable assets to cover 30 days of withdrawals and obligations.
The ratio helps protect everyday depositors by ensuring banks can handle sudden market disruptions or customer panic without freezing up.
Not all assets count equally—regulators rank them in three tiers based on how quickly they can be converted to cash.
While designed to prevent another 2008-style meltdown, the LCR's effectiveness has been called into question by bank runs and other crises since then.
What Is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?
The LCR is a result of updates to the
Basel Accords
, regulations created by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
3
The rule is designed to be a stress test that banks must pass every day, not just to protect the bank itself but also the financial and economic actors that rely on it.
The LCR requires financial institutions to maintain a precise mix of assets that can be quickly turned into cash—think Treasury bonds, not long-term loans or real estate—to tide them over for 30 days.
4
These assets are ranked in three tiers based on how easy they would be to use in a crisis.

Level 1 assets are counted at full value. These include cash, central
bank reserves
, and government securities that markets will always want to buy. Level 2A assets are high-quality but less liquid, so they get a 15% haircut when banks count them. Level 2B assets include corporate stocks and bonds, and banks can only count 50%-75% of their value toward their LCR.
5
The 30-day survival period wasn't chosen randomly. It's based on historical patterns of how financial crises unfold. Most banks that survived past crises managed to hold on for about a month before government intervention turned the tide.
6
Since implementation, many researchers have said these changes aren't enough. ""The requirement for liquidity in the LCR is based on a stress test that understates the likely outflows of cash in a crisis,"" Ball said.
Ball's research shows the rules may underestimate three important components of how banks would stay liquid in a crisis: how much money regular customers might withdraw, how much short-term funding from other banks might disappear, and how much cash banks might need to post as collateral for their financial contracts.
7
As such, he argued, ""The big U.S. banks are at risk of liquidity crises that threaten their survival even if they comply with the LCR rule.""
Important
In 2019, the Trump administration changed U.S. LCR requirements to cut compliance costs for midsized banks, act on industry arguments that smaller regional banks posed less systemic risk than global giants, and carry out the so-called
Crapo Bill
(Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018), which directed regulators to adjust requirements based on bank size and complexity.
8
2019 Changes To the LCR
Even before implementation, there was a push and pull between regulators and the banking community over the LCR, which has sought to weaken its requirements. That's because every dollar held in super-liquid assets isn't generating higher returns elsewhere.
7
Under the first Trump administration, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
issued its so-called ""tailoring rule"" in 2019, a significant rollback of post-2008 banking regulations. Under this change, banks with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion were no longer required to meet the LCR requirements, leaving only the largest U.S. banks required to do so.
9
Before the change, any bank with either 1) $250 billion or more in total assets or 2) $10 billion or more in foreign exposure had to maintain a 100% LCR ratio. Afterward, the requirements were as follows:
Banks with $700 billion-plus in assets or $75 billion-plus in cross-border activity faced the full LCR requirements.
Banks between $250 to $700 billion faced fewer such requirements.
Banks under $250 billion no longer faced requirements.
The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (
SVB
) in 2023 led many experts to question whether these changes were in part responsible since SVB would have been required to hold significantly more liquid assets under the pre-2019 rules.
7
""We learned from the 2023 bank runs that the stability of the financial system can be threatened by crises at somewhat smaller banks, such as SVB,"" Ball said.
How To Calculate the LCR
While the concept behind the LCR is straightforward, the actual calculation requires careful attention to detail. Banks must maintain a ratio of at least 100%, meaning their liquid assets must equal or exceed their expected cash outflows during a 30-day crisis. Here's the formula:
L
C
R
=
High quality liquid asset amount (HQLA)
Total net cash flow amount
LCR = \frac{\text{High quality liquid asset amount (HQLA)}}{\text{Total net cash flow amount}}
L
C
R
=
Total net cash flow amount
High quality liquid asset amount (HQLA)
​
Let's use an example. Suppose Major National Bank, with over $250 billion in assets, holds $85 billion in highly liquid assets, primarily
U.S. Treasury bonds
, central bank deposits, and other Level 1 assets. Its risk team projects that during a market crisis, it might need $68 billion to cover withdrawals, loan commitments, and other obligations over 30 days.
Its LCR would be as follows:
$85 billion / $68 billion = 125%
At 125%, Major National Bank would meet both the minimum requirement of 100%. However, calculating the components isn't as simple as it might appear. Large banks must do the following:
Assess each asset's quality tier and apply the required discounts
Project realistic cash outflows based on historical data and stress scenarios
Account for potential changes in collateral values
Consider the timing of incoming payments and outgoing obligations
Factor in the behavior of both retail and institutional depositors during stress periods
10
The LCR vs. Capital Requirements
A bank can be well-capitalized but face liquidity problems if its assets are illiquid, or liquid but undercapitalized if it lacks loss-absorbing capacity. During the
2008 financial crisis
, some banks failed due to liquidity issues despite having adequate capital. This led regulators to introduce both stronger
capital requirements
and new liquidity standards like the LCR.
While both aim to make banks more resilient, they protect against different risks. Liquidity requirements, like the LCR, focus on a bank's ability to meet short-term obligations such as deposit withdrawals without having to sell assets at fire-sale prices.
Capital requirements
focus on a bank's ability to absorb losses over the longer term. Capital is the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities, essentially its net worth. The more capital a bank has, the more resources it has to absorb losses while remaining solvent. The largest and most interconnected banks, designated as global systemically important banks (
G-SIBs
), have additional capital requirements due to the greater risk their failure would pose to the financial system.
For example, JPMorgan & Chase & Co. (
JPM
), as a G-SIB, must maintain the highest capital buffers of any bank in the world (see the table below), including a 2.5% G-SIB surcharge.
The Bottom Line
The LCR is a key post-2008 reform designed to prevent bank failures by requiring large financial institutions to maintain emergency funds. However, recent bank failures have shown that its effectiveness depends on which banks must follow the rules and how regulators enforce them. The LCR alone can't prevent all banking crises—indeed, experts like Ball have argued its assumptions are too rosy and that banks will need far more on hand in a crisis. For example, since the LCR, ""we've learned that uninsured deposits can leave banks extremely quickly,"" he said.
Still, LCR remains an important tool for measuring and maintaining financial system stability.

Investopedia,What Is Human Capital?,"Close
Definition
Human capital is the value employees bring to a company that translates to productivity or profitability.
What Is Human Capital?
Human capital is the
economic value
of a worker's experience and skills. Human capital is further enhanced by education, training, intelligence, skills, health, and other qualities employers value, such as loyalty and punctuality. Human capital is an intangible asset not listed on a company's
balance sheet
and perceived to increase productivity and profitability.
Key Takeaways
Human capital is an intangible asset not listed on a company's balance sheet.
Employers can improve human capital by investing in employee training, education, and benefits.
Human capital is perceived to add to a company's growth, productivity, and profitability.
Theories of Human Capital
In the 18th century, economist Adam Smith referred to the concept in his book ""An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations""
,
in which he explored a nation's
wealth
, knowledge, training, talents, and experiences. Adams suggested that improving human capital through training and education leads to a more profitable enterprise.
1
In the 1960s, economist
Theodore Schultz
analyzed the value of human capacities. Schultz compared human capital to other forms of capital that improve the quality and level of
production
, and companies must invest in the education, training, and enhanced benefits of an organization's employees.
2
The terms ""human capital"" and ""human resources"" have been criticized as they reduce employees to other workplace resources like utilities or technology. Some employment support organizations like ADP advise using terms like ""associates"" or ""people"" to discourage the anonymous tone that the phrase ""human capital"" means for individuals with families and personal lives who come into the office.
3
Investing In Employees
Employees are typically managed by an organization's
human resources
(HR) department, which oversees workforce acquisition, management, and optimization. Its other directives include workforce planning and strategy,
recruitment
, employee training and development, and reporting and analytics.

Since human capital is based on improving employee skills and knowledge through education, these investments can be easily calculated. Any
return on investment (ROI)
of human capital can be calculated by dividing the company’s total profits by its overall investments in human capital. All of this has great economic
value
for employers and the economy.
Companies that invest to improve employees and then show a profit can compare the ROI of human capital
year-over-year (YOY)
to track how profit is improved and whether it relates to their investments in its workforce.
Important
Job skills through employer training can attribute to 46% of the average employee's lifetime earnings.
4
Human Capital and Economic Growth
There is a strong relationship between
human capital and economic growth
. Companies that invest in employees retain talented workers and see consistent earnings compared to industry peers. People who participate in the workforce with higher education will often have larger salaries, which means they can spend more in the local economy.
4
Like anything else, human capital is not immune to
depreciation
. This is often measured in wages or the ability to stay in the workforce. The most common ways human capital can depreciate are
unemployment
, injury, or loss of a specialized skill.
Human capital tends to migrate, especially in global economies. That's why there is often a shift from developing places or rural areas to more developed and urban areas. Some economists have dubbed this a
brain drain
or human capital flight. This describes the process that keeps certain areas underdeveloped while others become even more developed.
5
What Improves Human Capital Retention?
Employers can improve human capital retention with training and education in communication, technical skills, problem-solving skills, and employee health benefits.
4
Why Is It Difficult to Quantify Human Capital?
Human capital is not easily measured like debt or equity. It equates more to intellectual property and
intellectual capital
. Human capital is commonly measured by the skills a company's workforce possesses.
What Is Workforce Risk?
Workforce risk refers to the gap between a company's employee requirements and the availability of the skills and talents needed to maintain its workforce. Workforce risk threats affect a company's operational and financial abilities.
6
The Bottom Line
Human capital is the economic value of a worker's abilities and skills. Companies can enhance their human capital through recruitment or training and by implementing management techniques that optimize the productivity of their existing workers. Maintaining and improving the value of human capital is usually the role of a company's HR department.

Investopedia,"51% Attack: Definition, Who Is At Risk, Example, and Cost","Close
What Is a 51% Attack?
A 51% attack is an attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by an entity or group that controls more than 50% of the network. If a party were to gain this much control of a network, it would have the power to alter the blockchain.
The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse non-confirmed transactions that were completed while they were in control. Reversing transactions could allow them to double-spend coins, one of the issues mechanisms like proof-of-work were created to prevent.
Key Takeaways
Blockchains are distributed ledgers that record every transaction made on a cryptocurrency's network.
A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain by an entity or group that controls more than 50% of the network.
Attackers with majority network control can interrupt the recording of new blocks by preventing other miners from completing blocks.
Changing historical blocks is impossible due to the chain of information stored in Bitcoin's blockchain.
Although a successful attack on Bitcoin or Ethereum is unlikely, smaller networks are frequent targets for 51% attacks.
Understanding a 51% Attack
A
blockchain
is a distributed ledger—essentially a database—that records transactions and information about them. The blockchain's network reaches a majority consensus about transactions through a validation process. The blocks where the data is stored are sealed. The blocks are linked together via cryptographic techniques where previous block information is recorded in each block. This makes the blocks nearly impossible to alter once they are confirmed enough times.
The 51% attack is an attack on the blockchain, where a group controls more than 50% of the hashing power—the computing that solves the cryptographic puzzle—of the network. This group then introduces an altered blockchain to the network at a very specific point in the blockchain, which is theoretically accepted by the network because the attackers would own most of it.
1
Changing historical blocks—transactions locked in before the start of the attack—would be extremely difficult even in the event of a 51% attack. The further back the transactions are, the more difficult it is to change them. It would be impossible to change transactions before a checkpoint, where transactions become permanent in Bitcoin's blockchain.
Attacks Are Prohibitively Expensive
A 51% attack is a very difficult and challenging task on a blockchain network with a large participation rate. In most cases, the group of attackers would need to be able to control the necessary 51% and have created an alternate blockchain that can be inserted at exactly the right moment. Then, they would need to out-hash the main network. The cost of doing this is one of the most significant factors that prevent a 51% attack.
For example, one of the most advanced application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners is the WhatsMiner M63S. It costs more than $10,000 (new) and has a
hash
rate of 406 terahashes per second (TH/s).
2
A single or smaller group of miners would not be able to alter and mine the Bitcoin blockchain with only a few of these machines. It would take thousands of these ASICs to get ahead of the Bitcoin network. Smaller networks could be out-hashed using these mining rigs, but the benefits of doing so wouldn't outweigh the costs of funding the attack and setting it up.
Fast Fact
Hashing power rental services provide attackers with lower costs, as they only need to rent as much hashing power as they need for the duration of the attack.
3
After Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake, a 51% attack on the Ethereum blockchain became even more expensive. To conduct this attack, a user or group would need to own 51% of the staked ETH on the network. It is possible for someone to own that much ETH, but it's unlikely.
According to Beaconchain, more than 32.3 million ETH were staked on May 8, 2024.
4
An entity would need to own and stake more than 16.5 million ETH (more than $49 billion as of May 8, 2024) to attempt an attack.
5
Once the attack started, the consensus mechanism would likely recognize it and immediately slash the staked ETH, costing the attacker an extraordinary amount of money. Additionally, the community can vote to restore the ""honest"" chain, so an attacker would lose all of their ETH just to see the damage repaired.
6
Attack Timing
In addition to the costs, a group attempting to attack the network using a 51% attack must not only control 51% of the network but also introduce the altered blockchain at a very precise time. Even if they own 51% of the network hashing rate, they still might not be able to keep up with the block creation rate or get their chain inserted before valid new blocks are created by the 'honest' blockchain network.
Again, this is possible on smaller cryptocurrency networks because there is less participation and lower hash rates. Large networks make it nearly impossible to introduce an altered blockchain.
Fast Fact
Despite the name, it is not necessary to have 51% of a network's mining power to launch an attack. However, such an attack would have a much lower chance of success.
Outcome of a Successful Attack
In the event of a successful attack, the attackers could block other users' transactions or reverse them and spend the same cryptocurrency again. This vulnerability, known as
double-spending
, is the digital equivalent of a perfect counterfeit. It is also the basic cryptographic hurdle blockchain consensus mechanisms were designed to overcome.
Successful 51% attackers may also implement a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, where they block the addresses of other miners for the period they control the network.
1
This keeps the ""honest"" miners from reacquiring control of the network before the dishonest chain becomes permanent.
Who Is at Risk of 51% Attack?
The type of mining equipment is also a factor, as
ASIC
-secured mining networks are less vulnerable than those that can be mined with GPUs; they are much faster. Cloud services such as NiceHash—which considers itself a ""hash-power broker""—theoretically make it possible to launch a 51% attack using only rented hash power, especially against smaller, GPU-only networks.
7
Bitcoin Gold has been a common target for attackers because it is a smaller cryptocurrency by hashrate. Since June 2019, the Michigan Institute for Technology's Digital Currency Initiative has detected, observed, or been notified of more than 40 51% attacks—also called chain reorganizations, or reorgs—on Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, and other smaller cryptocurrencies.
3
Are the Odds of a Bitcoin 51% Attack Growing?
On May 8, 2024, the Bitcoin network's total hashrate was 569.29 exahashes per second (EH/s). The top three
mining pools
by three-day hashrate were:
8
FoundryUSA, at 175.76 EH/s; 30.9% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate
AntPool, at 161.77 EH/s; 28.4% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate
ViaBTC, at 73.11 EH/s; 12.8% of the total network hashrate
Combined, these three pools made up 72.1% of the network hashrate, a whopping 486.9 EH/s (486.9 million TH/s—the CPU in your computer might be able to hash at about 15 kilo hashes per second). If Foundry and ViaBTC were to collude, they could take over 51% of the hashrate (248 EH/s).
Foundry and Antpool combined could control 69.3% of the network. Because these pools use platforms to connect pool members and manage workloads, if the managers decided to take control they could issue work orders to their pools to work on the altered chain. The pool's miners would have no idea which chain they were working on since their mining rigs automatically work on whatever task they are given.
Even more concerning is that these three pools also monopolize the majority of the network hash rates for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin SV.
These pools have been operating for several years without issue, but the fact remains that they already control most hashing power of the minable and profitable cryptocurrencies.
8
What Does a 51% Attack Do?
A 51% attack alters blocks that are being added to the blockchain, giving the attackers the ability to create or alter transactions for the period they are in control.
Has a 51% Attack Ever Happened?
Yes. Several blockchains have been attacked using this method, but they had small networks, were new, or had other vulnerabilities that made it possible.
How Much Would a 51% Attack on BTC Cost?
If a large mining pool was directed by its managers to conduct an attack, it wouldn't cost the managers much at the time of the attack. However, it would likely lose its honest miners once they found out about it. For a single person or group to conduct a 51% attack, they would need more than 304 EH/s of computing power. This is an enormous cost considering the fastest miner hashes 406 TH/s and costs more than $10,000 per unit (about 84,000 units).
The Bottom Line
A 51% attack is the unlikely event that a group will acquire more than 50% of the hashing power of a cryptocurrency network. These attacks happen on smaller crypto networks, but tend to fail on larger ones like Bitcoin because they are more secure.

Definition
ESG investing involves evaluating a company for a possible investment based on its performance relating to environmental, social, and governance criteria.
What Is ESG Investing?
ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. ESG investing refers to how companies score on these responsibility metrics and standards for
potential investments
. Environmental criteria gauge how a company safeguards the environment. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and communities. Governance measures a company’s leadership, executive pay,
audits
,
internal controls
, and shareholder rights.
Key Takeaways
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is used to screen investments based on corporate policies and to encourage companies to act responsibly.
Many brokerage firms offer investment products that employ ESG principles.
ESG investing can help portfolios avoid holding companies engaged in risky or unethical practices.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
How ESG Investing Works
ESG investing is sometimes referred to as
sustainable
investing, responsible investing,
impact investing
, or
socially responsible investing
(SRI). To assess a company based on ESG criteria, investors look at a broad range of behaviors and policies. ESG investors seek to ensure the companies they fund are responsible stewards of the environment, good corporate citizens, and led by accountable managers based on criteria including:
Environmental:
Investors evaluate corporate climate policies, energy use, waste, pollution, natural resource conservation, and treatment of animals. Considerations may include direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, management of toxic waste, and compliance with environmental regulations.
1
Social:
A company's relationships with internal and external
stakeholders
are evaluated.
2
Does the company donate a percentage of profits to the local community or encourage employees to volunteer? Do workplace conditions reflect a high regard for employees’ health and safety?
Governance:
Ensures a company uses accurate and transparent accounting methods, pursues integrity and diversity in selecting its leadership, and is accountable to shareholders.
3
ESG investors may require assurances that companies avoid
conflicts of interest
in their choice of board members and senior executives, don't use political contributions to obtain preferential treatment or engage in illegal conduct.
ESG investors help inform the investment choices of large institutional investors such as public pension funds. ESG-specific mutual funds and ETFs reached a record $480 billion AUM in 2023.
4
Brokerage and mutual fund companies offer
exchange-traded funds
(ETFs) and other financial products that follow ESG investing strategies.
Robo-advisors
including
Betterment
and
Wealthfront
have promoted these ESG-themed offerings to younger investors.
Important
Socially responsible investing
(SRI) is an investment strategy highlighting one facet of ESG. SRI investors seek companies that promote
ethical and socially conscious themes
including diversity, inclusion, community focus, social justice, corporate ethics, and racial, gender, and sexual discrimination.
ESG Metrics
Investment firms like Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, use a variety of ESG factors to help identify companies positioned for strong long-term performance. The criteria are set by analysts who identify the relevant issues facing specific sectors, industries, and companies.

Trillium's ESG criteria preclude investments in companies that operate in higher-risk areas or have exposure to coal or hard rock mining, nuclear or coal power, private prisons, agricultural biotechnology, tobacco, tar sands, or weapons and firearms. They do not invest in companies involved in major or recent controversies over human rights, animal welfare, environmental concerns, governance issues, or product safety.
5
Trillium's metrics include investments in companies that support the environment through renewable energy sources and published sustainability reports. Social metrics include companies that operate ethical supply chains and avoid overseas labor with questionable workplace or child labor policies. Metrics for governance require companies to embrace diversity on the board of directors and maintain corporate transparency.
5
Investors and ESG
As ESG business practices gain traction, investment firms track their performance. Financial services companies such as JPMorgan Chase (
JPM
), Wells Fargo (
WFC
), and Goldman Sachs (
GS
) publish annual reports that extensively review their ESG approaches and the bottom-line results.
6
7
8
The ultimate value of ESG investing depends on whether they encourage companies to drive real change for the common good, or merely check boxes and publish reports.
9
That, in turn, will depend on whether the investment flows follow ESG tenets that are realistic, measurable, and actionable.
Tobacco and defense are two industries avoided by many ESG investors, but historically produced above-average market returns and can buck recessionary trends. To support ESG, U.S. investors may be sacrificing returns in exchange for values. Many ESG investors are willing to make that tradeoff, though; according to a
survey
of
Investopedia
and
Treehugger
readers, nearly half of ESG investors said they’d be willing to take a 10% loss over five years to invest in a company that “aligns exceptionally against ESG standards.” But 74% of respondents said that valuation/price was “very or extremely important to them.”
How Is ESG Investing Different From Sustainable Investing?
ESG and sustainability are closely related. ESG investing screens
companies based on criteria
related to being pro-social, environmentally friendly, and with good corporate governance. Together, these features can lead to sustainability. ESG, therefore, looks at how a company's management and stakeholders make decisions; sustainability considers the impact of those decisions on the world.
What Does ESG Mean for a Business?
Adopting ESG principles means corporate strategy focuses on environment, social, and governance. This means taking measures to lower pollution, and CO
2
output, and reduce waste. It also means having a diverse and inclusive workforce, at the entry level and the board of directors.
How Do I Know Which Investments Are ESG?
Several financial firms have ESG ratings and scoring systems. For instance,
MSCI has a rating scheme
covering over 8,500 companies, giving them scores and letter grades based on their compliance with ESG standards and
initiatives
. Several other companies, like Morningstar and Bloomberg, have also created
criteria for scoring companies
on the ESG objectives.
The Bottom Line
ESG investing focuses on companies that follow positive environmental, social, and governance principles. Investors are increasingly eager to
align their portfolios with ESG-related companies
and fund providers, making it an area of growth with positive effects on society and the environment.

Definition
Unemployment is a key indicator of economic health that occurs when individuals who are actively seeking work are unable to find employment.
What Is Unemployment?
Unemployment refers to a situation where a person actively
searches for employment
but is unable to find work. Unemployment is considered to be a key measure of the health of the economy. The most frequently used measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate. It's calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the number of people in the labor force.
Key Takeaways
Unemployment occurs when workers who want to work are unable to find jobs.
High rates of unemployment signal economic distress while extremely low rates of unemployment may signal an overheated economy.
Unemployment can be classified as frictional, cyclical, structural, or institutional.
Unemployment data is collected and published by government agencies in a variety of ways.
Many governments offer unemployed individuals a small amount of income through unemployment insurance, as long as they meet certain requirements.
Michela Buttignol / Investopedia
Understanding Unemployment
Unemployment is a key
economic indicator
because it signals the ability (or inability) of workers to obtain gainful work and contribute to the productive output of the economy. More unemployed workers mean less total economic production.
The unemployment definition doesn't include people who leave the workforce for reasons such as
retirement
, higher education, and disability.
1
Sign of Economic Distress
Unemployed workers must maintain at least subsistence consumption during their period of unemployment. This means that an economy with high unemployment has lower output without a proportional decline in the need for basic consumption.
High, persistent unemployment can signal serious distress in an
economy
and even lead to social and political upheaval.
Sign of an Overheating Economy
A low unemployment rate, on the other hand, means that the economy is more likely to be producing near its full capacity, maximizing output, driving wage growth, and raising living standards over time.
However,
extremely low unemployment
can also be a cautionary sign of an overheating economy, inflationary pressures, and tight conditions for businesses in need of additional workers.
Categories of Unemployment
While the definition of unemployment is clear, economists divide unemployment into many different categories. The two broadest categories are voluntary and involuntary unemployment. When unemployment is voluntary, it means that a person left their job willingly in search of other employment. When it is involuntary, it means that a person was fired or laid off and must now look for another job.
2
Types of Unemployment
Voluntary and involuntary unemployment can be broken down into four types. We highlight them below.
Frictional Unemployment
This type of unemployment is usually short-lived. It is also the least problematic from an economic standpoint. It occurs when people voluntarily change jobs. After a person leaves a company, it naturally takes time to find another job. Similarly, graduates just starting to look for jobs to enter the workforce add to
frictional unemployment
.
Frictional unemployment is a natural result of the fact that
market
processes take time and information can be costly. Searching for a new job, recruiting new workers, and matching the right workers to the right jobs all take time and effort. This results in frictional unemployment.
Cyclical Unemployment
Cyclical unemployment
is the variation in the number of unemployed workers over the course of economic upturns and downturns, such as those related to changes in oil prices. Unemployment rises during recessionary periods and declines during periods of economic growth.
Preventing and alleviating cyclical unemployment during recessions is one of the key reasons for the study of economics and the various policy tools that governments employ to stimulate the economy on the downside of business cycles.
Structural Unemployment
Structural unemployment
comes about through a technological change in the structure of the economy in which labor markets operate. Technological changes can lead to unemployment among workers displaced from jobs that are no longer needed. Examples of such changes include the replacement of horse-drawn transport with automobiles and the automation of manufacturing.
Retraining these workers can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Displaced workers often end up either unemployed for extended periods or leaving the labor force entirely.
Institutional Unemployment
Institutional unemployment results from long-term or permanent institutional factors and incentives in the economy. The following can all contribute to institutional unemployment:
Government policies
, such as high minimum wage floors, generous social benefits programs, and restrictive occupational licensing laws
Labor market phenomena, including
efficiency wages
and discriminatory hiring
Labor market institutions, such as high rates of unionization
Important
Many governments offer unemployment insurance to certain unemployed individuals who meet eligibility requirements.
How to Measure Unemployment
The U.S. government uses surveys, census counts, and the number of
unemployment insurance
claims to track unemployment.
The U.S. Census conducts a monthly survey called the
Current Population Survey (CPS)
on behalf of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
to produce the primary estimate of the nation’s unemployment rate. This survey has been done every month since 1940.
1
The sample consists of about 60,000 eligible households. That translates to about 110,000 people each month. The Census changes a quarter of the sampled households each month so that no household is represented for more than four consecutive months. This is meant to strengthen the reliability of the estimates.
1
Many variations of the unemployment rate exist, with different definitions of who is an unemployed person and who is in the labor force.
The BLS commonly cites the
U-3 unemployment rate
(defined as the total unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force) as the official unemployment rate; however, this definition does not include discouraged unemployed workers who are no longer looking for work.
3
Other categories of unemployment include discouraged workers and part-time or underemployed workers who want to work full-time but, for economic reasons, are unable to do so.
4
History of Unemployment
Although the U.S. government
began tracking unemployment
in the 1940s, the highest rate of unemployment to date occurred during the Great Depression, when unemployment rose to 24.9% in 1933.
5
Between 1931 and 1940, the unemployment rate remained above 14% but subsequently dropped down to the single digits. It remained there until 1982 when it climbed above 10%.
6
In 2009, during the Great Recession, unemployment again rose to 10%. In April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment hit 14.8%. As of December 2024, the
unemployment rate
was 4.1%, a decrease of 0.1% from the previous month.
7
What Are the Main Causes of Unemployment?
There are many reasons for unemployment. These include recessions, depressions, technological improvements, job outsourcing, and voluntarily leaving one job to find another.
What Are the 3 Types of Unemployment?
Today's economists point to three main types of unemployment: frictional, structural, and cyclical. Frictional unemployment is the result of voluntary employment transitions within an economy. Frictional unemployment naturally occurs, even in a growing, stable economy as workers change jobs.
Structural unemployment can produce permanent disruptions due to fundamental and permanent changes that occur in the structure of the economy. These changes can marginalize a group of workers. They include technological changes, a lack of relevant skills, and jobs moving overseas to another country. Cyclical unemployment relates to the loss of jobs that occurs during changes in business cycles.
What Is the Strict Definition of Unemployment?
The official unemployment definition comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which states that ""people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and are currently available for work.""

Investopedia,Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP): Definition and Rules,"Close
What Is a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)?
A qualified institutional placement (QIP) is, at its core, a way for listed companies to raise capital without having to submit legal paperwork to market regulators. It is common in India and other Southeast Asian countries.
The
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
created the rule to avoid the dependence of companies on foreign capital resources.
Key Takeaways
Qualified institutional placements (QIPs) are a way to issue shares to the public without going through standard regulatory compliance.
QIPs instead follow a looser set of regulations but where allottees are more highly regulated.
The practice is mostly used in India and other Southeast Asian countries.
QIPs were created to avoid dependency on foreign resources for raising capital.
Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) are the only entities allowed to purchase QIPs.
How a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) Works
A qualified institutional placement (QIP) was initially a designation of a
securities
issue given by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The QIP allows an Indian-listed company to raise capital from domestic markets without the need to submit any pre-issue filings to market regulators. The SEBI limits companies to only raising money through issuing securities.
The SEBI put forth the guidelines for this unique avenue of Indian
financing
on May 8, 2006. The primary reason for developing QIPs was to keep India from depending too much on foreign capital to fund its economic growth.
Before the QIP, there was a growing concern from Indian regulators that its domestic companies were accessing international funding too readily via
American depositary receipts (ADRs)
,
foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs)
, and
global depositary receipts (GDRs)
, rather than by Indian-based capital sources. Authorities proposed the QIP guidelines to encourage Indian companies to raise funds domestically instead of tapping into overseas markets.
QIPs are helpful for a few reasons. Their use saves time as the issuance of QIPs and the access to capital are far quicker than through a
follow-on public offer (FPO)
. The speed is because QIPs have far fewer legal rules and regulations to follow, making them much more cost-efficient. Further, there are fewer legal fees, and there is no cost of listing overseas.
In India, 20 firms together raised 18.443 billion rupees ($221 billion) through QIPs in the first half of
fiscal year
2024.
1
Regulations for a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)
To be allowed to raise
capital
through a QIP, a firm must be listed on a
stock exchange
along with the minimum shareholding requirements as specified in their listing agreement. Also, the company must issue at least 10% of its issued securities to mutual funds or
allottees
.
Regulations also exist for the number of allottees on a QIP, depending on the specific factors within an issue. Additionally, no single allottee is allowed to own more than 50% of the total debt issue. Furthermore, allottees must not be related in any way to promoters of the issue. Several more regulations dictate who may or may not receive QIP securities issues.
Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs) and Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs)
The only parties eligible to purchase QIPs are
qualified institutional buyers (QIBs)
, which are accredited investors, as defined by whatever securities and exchange governing body preside over it. This limitation is due to the perception that QIBs are institutions with expertise and financial power that allows them to evaluate and participate in capital markets, at that level, without the legal assurances of a follow-on public offer (FPO).
Who Created the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)?
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) created the qualified institutional placement (QIP). The purpose was to avoid the dependence of companies on foreign capital resources.
What Are the Advantages of QIPs?
The use of QIPs saves time because the issuance of QIPs and the access to capital are far quicker than through a follow-on public offer (FPO). QIPs have far fewer legal rules and regulations to follow, making them not only faster but also more cost-efficient. Additionally, there are fewer legal fees and no cost of listing overseas.
What Are the Disadvantages of QIPs?
The disadvantages of QIPs include:
2
A limited
investor
base
Market dependency
3
Potential stake
dilution
The risk of
underpricing
The Bottom Line
Qualified institutional placements (QIPs) are a way for listed companies to raise capital without having to submit legal paperwork to market regulators. They follow a looser set of regulations, but in return, allottees are more highly regulated. QIPs are used mostly in India and other Southeast Asian countries.

What Is Fiat Money?
Fiat money is a government-issued currency that's not backed by a physical commodity such as gold or silver. It's backed by the government that issues it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government rather than the worth of a commodity backing it.
Most modern paper
currencies
are fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, and other major global currencies.
Key Takeaways
Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold.
Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control how much money is printed.
Most modern paper currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are fiat currencies.
One danger of fiat money is that governments can print too much of it, resulting in hyperinflation.
Investopedia / Ryan Oakley
Understanding Fiat Money
The term ""fiat"" is a Latin word that's often translated as ""it shall be"" or ""let it be done."" Fiat currencies only have value because the government maintains that value. There's no utility to fiat money in itself.
Governments would mint coins out of a valuable physical commodity such as gold or silver before fiat currency came about. They might have printed paper money that could be redeemed for a set amount of a physical commodity. Fiat is inconvertible, however. It can't be redeemed because there's no underlying commodity backing it.
Fiat money isn't linked to physical reserves such as a national stockpile of gold or silver so it risks losing value due to inflation. It might even become worthless in the event of
hyperinflation
. The rate of inflation can double in a single day in some of the
worst cases of hyperinflation
, such as in Hungary immediately after WWII.

The money will no longer hold value if people lose faith in a nation's currency unlike a currency backed by gold. This type of currency has intrinsic value because of the demand for gold in jewelry and decoration as well as in the manufacturing of electronic devices, computers, and aerospace vehicles.
History of Fiat Money in the U.S.
The U.S. dollar is considered to be both fiat money and legal tender. It's accepted for private and public debts. Legal tender is any currency that a government declares to be legal. Many governments issue a fiat currency and then make it legal tender by setting it as the standard for
debt
repayment.
The country's currency was backed by gold and in some cases
silver
earlier in U.S. history. The federal government stopped allowing citizens to exchange currency for government gold with the passage of the Emergency Banking Act of 1933. The
gold standard
backed U.S. currency with federal gold but it ended completely in 1971 when the U.S. also stopped issuing gold to foreign governments in exchange for U.S. currency.

U.S. dollars have been backed by the ""full faith and credit"" of the U.S. government since that time. They're ""legal tender for all debts, public and private"" but not ""redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury or at any Federal Reserve Bank,"" as the printing on U.S. dollar bills used to claim. U.S. dollars are ""legal tender"" rather than ""lawful money"" in this sense, which can be exchanged for gold, silver, or any other commodity.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Fiat Money
Advantages
Gives central banks greater control over the economy
Is cost-efficient to produce
Provides governments with flexibility
Disadvantages
Isn't a foolproof way to protect the economy
Creates an opportunity for a bubble
Provides risk of inflation
Advantages Explained
Fiat currencies gained prominence in the 20th century in part because governments and
central banks
sought to insulate their economies from the worst effects of the natural booms and busts of the business cycle.
Fiat money isn't a scarce or fixed resource like gold so central banks have much greater control over its supply. This gives them the power to manage economic variables such as credit supply, liquidity, interest rates, and money velocity. The
U.S. Federal Reserve
has the dual mandate to keep unemployment and inflation low and using fiat money can help it meet those goals.
5
Fiat money serves as a good currency if it can handle the roles that a nation's economy requires of its monetary unit: storing value, providing a numerical account, and facilitating exchange. It also has excellent
seigniorage
. It's more cost-efficient to produce than a currency that's directly tied to a commodity.
Disadvantages Explained
The
mortgage crisis of 2007
and subsequent financial meltdown tempered the belief that central banks could necessarily prevent depressions or serious
recessions
by regulating the money supply.
A currency tied to gold is generally more stable than fiat money because of the limited supply of gold.
Important
There are also more opportunities for the creation of bubbles with fiat money because of its unlimited supply.
Examples of Fiat Money
The U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the
Albanian lek
, and the Indian rupee are all examples of fiat money. It's a currency that's backed by an issuing government so fiat money usually provides some economic stability, but not always.
The African nation of Zimbabwe provided an example of the worst-case scenario in the early 2000s. The country's central bank began to print money at a staggering pace in response to serious economic problems, resulting in hyperinflation.
Experts suggest that the currency lost 99.9% of its value during this time. Prices rose rapidly and consumers carried bags full of money just to purchase basic staples. The government of Zimbabwe was forced to issue a 100-trillion Zimbabwean dollar note at the height of the crisis. Foreign currencies were eventually used more widely than the Zimbabwean dollar.

Why Is Fiat Money Valuable?
Fiat money is backed entirely by the full faith and trust in the government that issued it in contrast to commodity-based money such as gold coins or paper bills redeemable for precious metals. This has merit because governments demand that you pay taxes in the fiat money it issues. Everybody must pay taxes or face stiff penalties or prison so people will accept it in exchange. This is known as chartalism.
Other theories of money such as the credit theory suggest that all money has a credit-debt relation so it doesn't matter if money is backed by anything to maintain value.
Why Do Modern Economies Favor Fiat Money?
Most countries used some sort of gold standard or backing by a commodity before the 20th century. The limited amount of gold coming out of mines and in central bank vaults couldn't keep up with the value that was being created, however, as international trade and finance grew in scale and scope. This caused serious disruptions to global markets and commerce.
Fiat money gives governments greater flexibility to manage their currency, set monetary policy, and stabilize global markets. It also allows for
fractional reserve banking
which lets commercial banks multiply the amount of money on hand to meet demand from borrowers.
What Are Some Alternatives to Fiat Money?
Virtually every country has legal tender that's fiat money. You can buy and sell gold and gold coins but these are rarely used in exchange or for everyday purchases. They tend to be more of a collectible or speculative asset.
Cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin
have emerged
as a challenge
to the inflationary nature of fiat currencies. These virtual assets don't seem to approach being ""money"" in the traditional sense, however, despite increased interest and adoption.
Does Fiat Money Lead to Hyperinflation?
There's always the possibility of hyperinflation when a country prints its own currency but most developed countries have experienced only moderate bouts of inflation. A low level of inflation is seen as a positive driver of economic growth and investment because it encourages people to put their money to work rather than have it sit idle and lose purchasing power over time.
Having a relatively strong and stable currency isn't only a mandate of most modern central banks. A rapidly devalued currency is harmful to trade and in obtaining financing.

What Is R-Squared?
R-squared (R
2
) is defined as a number that tells you how well the independent variable(s) in a statistical model explains the variation in the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit of the model to the data.
The formula for calculating R-squared is:
R
2
=
1
−
Unexplained Variation
Total Variation
\begin{aligned} &\text{R}^2 = 1 - \frac{ \text{Unexplained Variation} }{ \text{Total Variation} } \\ \end{aligned}
​
R
2
=
1
−
Total Variation
Unexplained Variation
​
​
Key Takeaways
R-squared is a statistical measure that indicates how much of the variation of a dependent variable is explained by an independent variable in a regression model.
In investing, R-squared is generally interpreted as the percentage of a fund’s or security’s price movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index.
An R-squared of 100% means that all movements of a security (or other dependent variable) are completely explained by movements in the index (or whatever independent variable you are interested in).
Xiaojie Liu / Investopedia
How to Calculate R-Squared
The calculation of R-squared requires several steps. This includes taking the data points (observations) of dependent and independent variables and conducting
regression analysis
to find the
line of best fit
, often from a regression model. This regression line helps to visualize the relationship between the variables. From there, you would calculate predicted values, subtract actual values, and square the results. These coefficient estimates and predictions are crucial for understanding the relationship between the variables. This yields a list of errors squared, which is then summed and equals the unexplained variance (or ""unexplained variation"" in the formula above).
To calculate the total variance (or total variation), you would subtract the average actual value from each of the actual values, square the results, and sum them. This process helps in determining the total
sum of squares
, which is an important component in calculating R-squared. From there, following the formula, divide the first sum of errors (unexplained variance) by the second sum (total variance), subtract the result from one, and you have the R-squared.
How to Interpret R-Squared
R-squared represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A value of 1 implies that all the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables, while a value of 0 suggests that the independent variables do not explain any of the variability. R-squared should be interpreted alongside other statistics and context, as high R-squared values can sometimes be misleading if the model is overfitted.
Whereas correlation explains the strength of the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable, R-squared explains the extent to which the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable. So, if the R-squared of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model’s inputs.
How to Use R-Squared
In investing, R-squared is generally interpreted as the percentage of a fund’s or security’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. For example, an R-squared for a
fixed-income security
vs. a bond index identifies the security’s proportion of price movement that is predictable based on a price movement of the index.

The same can be applied to a stock vs. the S&P 500 Index or any other relevant index. It may also be known as the
co-efficient of determination
.
R-squared values range from 0 to 1 and are commonly stated as percentages from 0% to 100%. An R-squared of 100% means that all of the movements of a security (or another dependent variable) are completely explained by movements in the index (or whatever independent variable you are interested in).
In investing, a high R-squared, from 85% to 100%, indicates that the stock’s or fund’s performance moves relatively in line with the index. A fund with a low R-squared, at 70% or less, indicates that the fund does not generally follow the movements of the index. A higher R-squared value will indicate a more useful beta figure. For example, if a stock or fund has an R-squared value of close to 100%, but has a beta below 1, it is most likely offering higher
risk-adjusted returns
.
R-Squared vs. Adjusted R-Squared
R-squared only works as intended in a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable. With a multiple regression made up of several independent variables, the R-squared must be adjusted.
The
adjusted R-squared
compares the descriptive power of regression models that include diverse numbers of predictors. This is often assessed using measures like R-squared to evaluate the
goodness of fit
. Every predictor added to a model increases R-squared and never decreases it. Thus, a model with more terms may seem to have a better fit just for the fact that it has more terms, while the adjusted R-squared compensates for the addition of variables; it only increases if the new term enhances the model above what would be obtained by probability and decreases when a predictor enhances the model less than what is predicted by chance.
In an overfitting condition, an incorrectly high value of R-squared is obtained, even when the model actually has a decreased ability to predict. This is not the case with the adjusted R-squared.
R-Squared vs. Beta
Beta and R-squared are two related, but different, measures of correlation. Beta is a measure of relative riskiness. A mutual fund with a high R-squared correlates highly with a benchmark. If the beta is also high, it may produce higher returns than the benchmark, particularly in
bull markets
.
R-squared measures how closely each change in the price of an asset is correlated to a benchmark. Beta measures how large those price changes are relative to a benchmark. Used together, R-squared and beta can give investors a thorough picture of the performance of asset managers. A beta of exactly 1.0 means that the risk (volatility) of the asset is identical to that of its benchmark.
Essentially, R-squared is a statistical analysis technique for the practical use and trustworthiness of betas of securities.
Limitations of R-Squared
R-squared will give you an estimate of the relationship between movements of a dependent variable based on an independent variable’s movements. However, it doesn’t tell you whether your chosen model is good or bad, nor will it tell you whether the data and predictions are biased.
A high or low R-squared isn’t necessarily good or bad—it doesn’t convey the reliability of the model or whether you’ve chosen the right regression. You can get a low R-squared for a good model, or a high R-squared for a poorly fitted model, and vice versa.
Tips for Improving R-Squared
Improving R-squared often requires a nuanced approach to model optimization. One potential strategy involves careful consideration of feature selection and engineering. By identifying and including only the most relevant predictors in your model, you can increase the likelihood of explaining relationships. This process may involve conducting thorough exploratory data analysis or using techniques like stepwise regression or regularization to select the optimal set of variables.
Another way of enhancing R-squared is addressing
multicollinearity
. Multicollinearity is when independent variables are highly correlated with each other. However, they can distort coefficient estimates and reduce the accuracy of the model. Techniques like variance inflation factor analysis or principal component analysis can help identify and mitigate multicollinearity.
You can also improve r-squared by refining model specifications and considering
nonlinear relationships
between variables. This may involve exploring higher-order terms, interactions, or transforming variables in different ways to better capture the hidden relationships between data points. In some cases, you'll have to have strong domain knowledge to get able to get this type of insight outside of the model.

What Is an Underwriter?
An underwriter is any party, usually a member of a financial organization, that evaluates and assumes another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments for a fee, usually in the form of a commission, premium, spread, or interest.
Underwriters try to determine the likelihood that a borrower will pay as promised and that enough
collateral
is available if there's a
default
. In the case of insurance, underwriters seek to assess a policyholder's health and other factors and spread the potential risk among as many people as possible.
1
Key Takeaways
An underwriter is any party, usually a member of a financial organization, that evaluates and assumes, for a fee, another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments.
Underwriters work in many areas of finance, from the insurance industry to mortgage lending.
Underwriters determine the level of risk for lenders.
Underwriters are critical to the mortgage industry, insurance industry, equity markets, and common types of debt securities trading because of their ability to ascertain risk.
A book runner is another name for a lead underwriter.
What Do Underwriters Do?
Underwriters
play a critical role in many industries in the financial world, including the mortgage industry, the insurance industry, equity markets, and some common types of debt securities trading. An individual in the position of a lead underwriter is sometimes called a
book runner
.
Modern-day underwriters play a variety of roles, depending on the industry in which they work. In general, underwriters are tasked with determining the level of
risk
involved in a transaction or other kind of business decision. Risk is the likelihood that an outcome or investment’s actual gains will differ from an expected outcome or
return
.
Investors rely on underwriters because they determine if a business risk is worth taking. Underwriters also contribute to sales-type activities. For example, in an
initial public offering (IPO)
, the underwriter might purchase the entire IPO issue and sell it to investors. An IPO is a process through which a previously privately owned company sells its
shares
on a public stock exchange for the first time.
1
History of Underwriters
The term “underwriter” first emerged in the early days of marine insurance. Shipowners sought insurance for a ship and its cargo to protect themselves if the boat and its contents were lost. Shipowners would prepare a document that described their ship and its contents, crew, and destination.
An agreed-upon rate and terms were set out in the paper. Businesspeople who wished to assume some obligation or risk would sign their name at the bottom and indicate how much exposure they were willing to accept. These businesspeople became known as underwriters.
2
Types of Underwriters
Mortgage Underwriters
The most common type of underwriter is a mortgage loan underwriter. Mortgage loans are approved based on a combination of an applicant’s income, credit history, debt ratios, and overall savings.
3
Mortgage loan underwriters ensure that a loan applicant meets all of these requirements, and they subsequently approve or deny a loan. Underwriters also review a property’s appraisal to ensure that it is accurate and that the home is worth the
purchase price
and loan amount.
Mortgage loan underwriters have final approval for all mortgage loans. Loans that aren't approved can go through an appeal process, but the decision requires overwhelming evidence to be overturned.
Fast Fact
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of insurance underwriters is projected to decline 4% from 2021 to 2031.
4
Insurance Underwriters
Insurance underwriters, like mortgage underwriters, review applications for coverage and accept or reject an applicant based on risk analysis. Insurance brokers and other entities submit insurance applications on behalf of clients, and insurance underwriters review the application and decide whether to offer insurance coverage.
Insurance underwriters
advise on risk management issues, determine available coverage for specific individuals, and review existing clients for continued coverage analysis.
5
Equity Underwriters
Underwriters administer the public issuance and distribution of securities—in the form of common or preferred
stock
—from a corporation or other issuing body in the equity markets. Perhaps the most prominent role of an equity underwriter is in the IPO process.
IPO underwriters are financial specialists who work closely with the issuing body to determine the initial offering price of the securities, buy the securities from the issuer, and sell the securities to investors via the underwriter’s
distribution network
.
IPO underwriters are typically investment banks that have IPO specialists on staff. These
investment banks
work with a company to ensure that all regulatory requirements are satisfied.
To gauge interest in the investment, the IPO specialists contact a large network of investment organizations—such as mutual funds and insurance companies. The amount of interest received by these large institutional investors helps an underwriter set the IPO price of the company’s stock.
Fast Fact
The underwriter also guarantees that a specific number of shares will be sold at that initial price and purchase any surplus.
1
Debt Security Underwriters
Underwriters purchase debt securities—such as government bonds, corporate bonds,
municipal bonds
, or preferred stock—from the issuing body (usually a company or government agency) to resell them for a profit. This profit is known as the underwriting spread.
An
underwriter
may resell debt securities directly to the marketplace or to dealers (who will then sell them to other buyers). When the issuance of debt security requires more than one underwriter, the resulting group of underwriters is known as an
underwriter syndicate
.
6
Why Are Underwriters Important?
Investors need underwriters to determine if a business risk is worth investing in. In addition, underwriters also contribute to the success of sales activities.
What Are Some Common Types of Underwriters?
A mortgage loan underwriter is one of the most common types of underwriters. Their job is to ensure that a loan applicant meets all requirements before approving or denying the loan. Another common type is insurance underwriters, who review
applications
for coverage and, based on their findings, accept or reject an applicant. Underwriters who work in the equity market must administer the public issuance and distribution of securities from a corporation or other entity in the form of common or preferred stock.
What Is a Book Runner?
A book runner is a primary underwriter or lead coordinator in issuing new equity, debt, or securities instruments. These types of underwriters also may coordinate with others to mitigate their own risk, for example, those representing companies in large, leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Because they combine the duties of an underwriter while coordinating the efforts of multiple involved parties and information sources,
book runners
become the central point for all information regarding the potential offering or issue.
The Bottom Line
An underwriter is any party, usually part of a larger financial organization, that evaluates and assumes, for a fee, another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments. Underwriters work in many areas of finance, from the insurance industry to mortgage lending. They are critical to the mortgage industry, insurance industry, equity markets, and common types of debt securities trading because of their ability to ascertain risk.

What Is ZK-SNARK?
Zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.” It is cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove it possesses certain information without revealing that information. This proof is made possible using a secret key created before the transaction takes place. Zk-SNARK is used as part of the protocol for the cryptocurrency
Zcash
.
Key Takeaways
Zk-SNARK is a zero-knowledge proof protocol used in encryption and is an acronym for ""Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.""
This proof was first developed and introduced in the late 1980s and is now employed by the cryptocurrency Zcash to solve a perceived anonymity problem with Bitcoin-type blockchains.
Zk-SNARK proofs once relied on an initial ""trust system"" setup that was replaced in 2022 with a setup that doesn't require trust.
Understanding ZK-SNARK
For many original members of the cryptocurrency community—primarily the Bitcoin community—privacy was an assumed aim and feature of
cryptocurrencies
. However, privacy was always a second-order concern, given cryptocurrency's need to create a ""trustless"" system of guaranteeing the integrity of electronic currency and digital transactions.
In the early 2010s,
Bitcoin
users sometimes assumed that their transactions were anonymous because their offline identities weren't associated with users' public keys. But through the end of the decade, coordinated efforts by data scientists, hackers, and law enforcement proved that it is not only possible but relatively easy to re-identify people who had given pseudonymous data to multiple sources.
Because of the perceived lack of privacy of some of the original cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, developers started working on privacy-focused coins. The
most prominent
of these is
Zcash
, backed by a privacy concept known as zk-SNARKs.

(""Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge"") utilizes a concept known as a ""zero-knowledge proof."" Put simply, a zero-knowledge proof is a situation in which each of two parties in a transaction is able to verify to each other that they have a particular set of information, while at the same time not revealing what that information is.
Fast Fact
The idea behind these proofs was first developed in the 1980s.
For most other types of proof, at least one of the two parties must have access to all the information. A traditional proof can be compared to a password used to access an online network. The user submits the password, and the network itself checks the contents of the password to verify that it is correct. In order to do this, the network must also have access to the contents of the password.
A zero-knowledge proof version of this situation would involve the user demonstrating to the network (via mathematical proof) that they have the correct password without actually revealing the password itself. The
privacy
and security advantages in this situation are clear: If the network does not have the password stored somewhere for verification purposes, the password cannot be stolen.
The mathematical basis of zk-SNARKS is complex. Nonetheless, proofs of this type allow one party to demonstrate not only that a particular bit of information exists but also that the party in question has awareness of that information. In the case of Zcash, zk-SNARKs can be verified nearly instantly, and the protocol does not require any interaction between the prover and the verifier.
ZK-SNARK Example
Because zk-SNARKs are tough to comprehend, it's best to use a simple example of what they are. Imagine you have a safebox with a combination lock at a bank with a note in it. The note has a signature and printed name on it. You believe you're the only one that knows what it says. You're discussing it with a friend but have not revealed anything about the note other than it exists in that safebox.
The friend tells you they know what it says and then tells you the name on the note. They have provided proof that they know the combination and what's on the note without revealing it.
On a
blockchain
, it is much more complicated, but this is the general idea. Someone provides proof they know something without revealing it.
Criticism of ZK-SNARKs
There are, of course, concerns related to zk-SNARKs. For instance, if someone was able to access the private key that was used to create the parameters of the proof protocol, they could create false proofs that nonetheless looked valid to verifiers. This would allow that person to create new Zcash tokens through a counterfeiting process. In order to prevent this from happening, Zcash was designed to elaborate the proving protocols and spread them out over multiple parties.
While the construction of the Zcash proving process was completed in such a way as to minimize the possibility of counterfeiting tokens via false proofs, there is at least one other concern related to the cryptocurrency as well. Zcash was created with a 20% ""tax"" levied on all blocks created over the first several years of the token. This tax is known as the ""founder's tax,"" and it is used to compensate the developers of the cryptocurrency.
Critics have suggested that the founders could potentially use this facet of the system to create an infinite number of Zcash tokens without anyone else being aware of the existence of those tokens. For that reason, it's not entirely possible to know the exact number of Zcash tokens in existence at this point.
Since 2019, some developers have been working to improve zk-SNARKs by removing the trusted setup. In 2022, Zcash developers implemented the Halo 2 zero-knowledge system, eliminating one of the blockchain's most significant privacy issues. Halo 2 doesn't require a trust setup between users.

What Is an Example of a Zk-SNARK?
In blockchains, a zk-SNARK is a proof that an entity has something (knowledge, data, and so on) but didn't reveal it to another entity. For instance, if a blockchain requires a public and secret key for a transaction, a hashed solution could be generated by one party, and the other could generate a solution that falls within a specified range, proving they have the information needed.
What Is a ZK-SNARK Circuit?
An electronic circuit is sometimes used to describe how zk-SNARK works or when designing a zero-knowledge process because there are electronic terms like ""gates"" and ""chips"" used when creating workflows.
2
What Is the Difference Between ZK-SNARK and ZK-STARK?
Zk-STARK stands for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge and is much more efficient when more witnesses are involved than zk-SNARK.
The Bottom Line
Zk-SNARKs serve as proof that one user has information without revealing it. This is a confusing but computationally quick mathematical process used in blockchains to maintain user privacy.

What Is an Unsecured Loan?
An unsecured loan is a loan that doesn’t require any type of
collateral
. Instead of relying on a borrower’s assets as security, lenders approve unsecured loans based on a borrower’s
creditworthiness
.
1
Examples of unsecured loans include personal loans, student loans, and credit cards.
Key Takeaways
An unsecured loan is supported only by the borrower’s creditworthiness, rather than by any collateral, such as property or other assets.
Unsecured loans are riskier than secured loans for lenders, so they require higher credit scores for approval.
Credit cards, student loans, and personal loans are examples of unsecured loans.
If a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the lender may commission a collection agency to collect the debt or take the borrower to court.
Lenders can decide whether or not to approve an unsecured loan based on a borrower’s creditworthiness, but laws protect borrowers from discriminatory lending practices.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
How an Unsecured Loan Works
Unsecured loans—sometimes referred to as
signature loans
or personal loans—are approved without the use of property or other assets as collateral. The terms of these loans, including approval and receipt, are most often contingent on a borrower’s
credit score
. Typically, borrowers must have high credit scores to be approved for unsecured loans.
An unsecured loan stands in contrast to a
secured loan
, in which a borrower pledges some type of asset as collateral for the loan. The pledged assets increase the
lender
’s “security” for providing the loan. Examples of secured loans include mortgages and car loans.
Because unsecured loans require higher credit scores than secured loans, in some instances, lenders will allow loan applicants with insufficient credit to provide a
co-signer
. A co-signer takes on the legal obligation to fulfill a debt if the borrower
defaults
. This occurs when a borrower fails to repay the
interest
and
principal
payments of a loan or debt.
Important
Because unsecured loans are not backed by collateral, they are riskier for lenders. As a result, these loans typically come with higher
interest rates
.
If a borrower defaults on a secured loan, the lender can repossess the collateral to recoup the losses. In contrast, if a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the lender cannot claim any property. But the lender can take other actions, such as commissioning a collection agency to collect the
debt
or taking the borrower to court. If the court rules in the lender’s favor, the borrower’s wages may be
garnished
.
Also, a
lien
can be placed on the borrower’s home (if they own one), or the borrower may be otherwise ordered to pay the debt. Defaults can have consequences for borrowers, such as lower credit scores.
Types of Unsecured Loans
Unsecured loans include personal loans, student loans, and most credit cards—all of which can be
revolving
or
term loans
.
A revolving loan is a loan that has a credit limit that can be spent, repaid, and spent again. Examples of revolving unsecured loans include
credit cards
and personal
lines of credit
.
A term loan, in contrast, is a loan that the borrower repays in equal installments until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. While these types of loans are often affiliated with secured loans, there are also unsecured term loans. A
consolidation loan
to pay off credit card debt or a signature loan from a bank would also be considered unsecured term loans.
In recent years, the unsecured loan market has experienced growth, powered partly by
financial technology (fintech)
firms. The past decade, for example, has seen the rise of
peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
via online and mobile lenders.
$1.358 Trillion
The amount of U.S. consumer revolving debt in Oct. 2024, according to the Federal Reserve.
2
If you’re looking to take out an unsecured loan to pay for personal expenses, a
personal loan calculator
is an excellent tool for determining what the monthly payment and total interest should be for the amount you’re hoping to borrow.
Unsecured Loan vs. Payday Loan
Some lenders offer
flex loans for people who need access to cash
. Flex loans are a type of line of credit and carry higher interest rates. They are an option available to those with poor or no credit history.
Alternative lenders, such as payday lenders or companies that offer merchant
cash advances
, do not offer secured loans in the traditional sense. Their loans are not secured by tangible collateral in the way that mortgages and car loans are. However, these lenders take other measures to secure repayment.
Payday lenders
, for example, require that borrowers give them a postdated check or agree to an automatic withdrawal from their checking accounts to repay the loan. Many online merchant cash advance lenders require the borrower to pay a certain percentage of online sales through a payment-processing service such as PayPal. These loans are considered unsecured even though they are partially secured.
3
Warning
Payday loans may be considered
predatory loans
, as they have a reputation for extremely high interest and hidden terms that charge borrowers added fees. In fact, some states have banned them.
3
Special Considerations
While lenders can decide whether or not to approve an unsecured loan based on your creditworthiness, laws protect borrowers from
discriminatory lending practices
. The enactment of the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
in 1974, for example, made it illegal for lenders to use race, color, sex, religion, or other non-creditworthiness factors when evaluating a loan application, establishing terms of a loan, or any other aspect of a credit transaction.
While lending practices have gradually become more equitable in the United States, discrimination still occurs. In July 2020, the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
, which takes the lead in supervising compliance and enforcing the ECOA, issued a Request for Information soliciting public comments to identify opportunities for improving what the ECOA does to ensure nondiscriminatory access to credit. “Clear standards help protect African Americans and other minorities, but the CFPB must back them up with action to make sure lenders and others follow the law,” stated Kathleen L. Kraninger, then-director of the CFPB.
4
5
What Is Considered Collateral?
Collateral is any item that can be taken to satisfy the value of a loan. Common forms of collateral include real estate, automobiles, jewelry, and other items of value.
Is a Co-Signed Loan Considered Secured?
Although having a co-signer may help you get approved for a loan, it doesn’t make the loan secured. In the case of a default, the lender would require the co-signer to repay the loan.
Can Bankruptcy Eliminate all Unsecured Loans?
Declaring
bankruptcy
is a serious undertaking, but in most cases, it will clear your unsecured loans. There is one exception, though:
student loans
. To have student loans forgiven, the debtor must prove that the loans present an undue hardship during an
adversary proceeding
. Private student loans used to pay for living expenses are more likely to be forgiven, though a new streamlined adversary proceeding paperwork is making it easier for even federal student loans to be discharged.
6
The Bottom Line
Unsecured loans are common but can bear significant risk for both the lender and the borrower. Before taking out any unsecured loan, assess your financial health and your ability to repay the loan. Borrowing money that you can’t repay can result in garnishment of wages and tax returns and put the borrower on a difficult path back to solvency.

What Is Net Present Value (NPV)?
Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in
capital budgeting
and investment planning to analyze a project's projected profitability.
NPV is the result of calculations that find the
current value of a future stream of payments
using the proper discount rate. In general, projects with a positive NPV are worth undertaking, while those with a negative NPV are not.
1
Key Takeaways
Net present value (NPV) is used to calculate the current value of a future stream of payments from a company, project, or investment.
To calculate NPV, you need to estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows and pick a discount rate equal to the minimum acceptable rate of return.
The discount rate may reflect your cost of capital or the returns available on alternative investments of comparable risk.
If the NPV of a project or investment is positive, it means its rate of return will be above the discount rate.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Net Present Value (NPV) Formula
If there’s one cash flow from a project that will be paid one year from now, then the calculation for the NPV of the project is as follows:
N
P
V
=

(
1

i
)
t
−
initial investment
where:
i
=

t
=

\begin{aligned} &NPV = \frac{\text{Cash flow}}{(1 + i)^t} - \text{initial investment} \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &i=\text{Required return or discount rate}\\ &t=\text{Number of time periods}\\ \end{aligned}

What NPV Can Tell You
NPV accounts for the
time value of money
and can be used to compare the rates of return of different projects or to compare a projected rate of return with the
hurdle rate
required to approve an investment.
2
The time value of money is represented in the NPV formula by the discount rate, which might be a hurdle rate for a project based on a company’s cost of capital, such as the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
. No matter how the discount rate is determined, a negative NPV shows that the expected rate of return will fall short of it, meaning that the project will not create value.
1
3
In the context of evaluating corporate securities, the net present value calculation is often called
discounted cash flow (DCF)
analysis. It’s the method used by Warren Buffett to compare the NPV of a company’s future DCFs with its current price.
4
The discount rate is central to the formula. It accounts for the fact that, as long as interest rates are positive, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. Inflation erodes the value of money over time.
Meanwhile, today’s dollar can be invested in a safe asset like government bonds; investments riskier than Treasuries must offer a higher rate of return. However it’s determined, the discount rate is simply the baseline rate of
return that a project must exceed
to be worthwhile.
For example, an investor could receive $100 today or a year from now. Most investors would not be willing to postpone receiving $100 today. However, what if an investor could choose to receive $100 today or $105 in one year? The 5% rate of return might be worthwhile if comparable investments of equal risk offered less over the same period.
If, on the other hand, an investor could earn 8% with no risk over the next year, then the offer of $105 in a year would not suffice. In this case, 8% would be the discount rate.
Note
When the interest rate increases, the discount rate used in the NPV calculation also increases. This higher discount rate reduces the present value of future cash inflows, leading to a lower NPV. As a result, projects or investments become less attractive because their potential profitability appears diminished when evaluated against a higher required rate of return.
Positive NPV vs. Negative NPV
A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings generated by a project or investment—discounted for their present value—exceed the anticipated costs, also in today’s dollars. It is assumed that an investment with a positive NPV will be profitable.
An investment with a negative NPV will result in a net loss. This concept is the basis for the
net present value rule
, which says that only investments with a positive NPV should be considered.

How to Calculate NPV Using Excel
In Excel, there is an NPV function that can be used
to easily calculate the net present value of a series of cash flows. This is a common tool in financial modeling. The NPV function in Excel is simply ""NPV,"" and the full formula requirement is:
=NPV(discount rate, future cash flow) + initial investment
NPV Example, Excel.
In the example above, the formula entered into the gray NPV cell is:
=NPV(green cell, yellow cells) + blue cell
= NPV(C3, C6:C10) + C5
Example of Calculating NPV
Imagine a company can invest in equipment that would cost $1 million and is expected to generate $25,000 a month in revenue for five years. Alternatively, the company could invest that money in securities with an expected annual return of 8%. Management views the equipment and securities as comparable investment risks.
There are two key steps for calculating the NPV of the investment in equipment:
Step 1: NPV of the Initial Investment
Because the equipment is paid for upfront, this is the first cash flow included in the calculation. No elapsed time needs to be accounted for, so the immediate expenditure of $1 million doesn’t need to be discounted.
Step 2: NPV of Future Cash Flows
Identify the number of periods (t):
The equipment is expected to generate monthly cash flow for five years, which means that there will be 60 periods included in the calculation after multiplying the number of years of cash flows by the number of months in a year.
Identify the discount rate (i):
The alternative investment is expected to return 8% per year. However, because the equipment generates a monthly stream of cash flows, the annual discount rate needs to be turned into a periodic, or monthly, compound rate. Using the following formula, we find that the periodic monthly compound rate is 0.64%.

Assume the monthly cash flows are earned at the end of the month, with the first payment arriving exactly one month after the equipment has been purchased. This is a future payment, so it needs to be adjusted for the time value of money. An investor can perform this calculation easily with a spreadsheet or calculator. To illustrate the concept, the first five payments are displayed in the table below.

An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking device that allows customers to perform basic financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals and check deposits.
What Is an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)?
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs, either in the U.S. or other countries.
ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals,
bill payments
, and transfers between accounts.
Fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is located, by the operator of the ATM, or by both. Some or all of these fees can be avoided by using an ATM operated directly by the bank network that holds the account. Using an ATM abroad can cost more than using one in the U.S. due to exchange rates or transaction fees.

Key Takeaways
ATMS, or automated teller machines, are banking outlets where you can withdraw cash without going into a branch of their bank.
Some ATMs only dispense cash, while others allow transactions such as check deposits or balance transfers.
The first ATMs appeared in 1960s and now number more than 2 million worldwide.
Today’s ATMs are capable of accepting deposits as well as administering several other banking services.
To avoid ATM fees, try to use an ATM by your own bank.
History of ATMs
The first ATM appeared at a branch of Barclays Bank in London in 1967, though there are reports of a cash dispenser in use in Japan in the mid-1960s.

The interbank communications networks that allowed a consumer to use one bank’s card at another bank’s ATM followed in the 1970s.
Within a few years, ATMs had spread around the globe, securing a presence in every major country. They now can be found even in tiny island nations such as Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.

Types of ATMs
There are two main types of ATMs. Basic units only allow you to withdraw cash and receive updated account balances.
The more complex machines accept deposits, facilitate
line of credit
payments and transfers, and access account information. To access the advanced features of the complex units, you often must be an accountholder at the bank that operates the machine.

Tip
You can now buy and sell Bitcoin and other crypto tokens via
Bitcoin ATMs
, Bitcoin ATMsare internet-connected terminals that will dispense cash in return for crypto. They may also accept cash or credit card to purchase crypto. There are now more than 28,000 Bitcoin ATMs located around the world.
7
ATM Design Elements
The design of each ATM may be different, but they all contain the same basic parts:
Card reader
: This part reads the chip on the front of your card or the magnetic stripe on the back.
Keypad
: The keypad is used to input information, including your
personal identification number (PIN)
, the type of transaction required, and the amount of the transaction.
Cash dispenser
: Bills are dispensed through a slot in the machine, which is connected to a safe at the bottom of the machine.
Printer
:
If required, you can request receipts that are printed out of the ATM. The receipt records the type of transaction, the amount, and the current account balance.
Screen
: The ATM issues prompts that guide you through the process of executing the transaction. Information about accounts and their balances is also transmitted on the screen.
Full-service machines often have slots for depositing paper checks or cash.
8
How To Use an ATM
To use an ATM, you typically insert your bank cards and follow the prompts to withdraw cash, which is dispensed through a slot. ATMs require you to use a plastic card—either a bank
debit card
or a credit card—to complete a transaction. Your identity is authenticated by a PIN before any transaction can be made.
Many cards come with a chip, which transmits data from the card to the machine. These work in the same way as a bar code that is scanned by a code reader.
Banks place ATMs inside and outside of their branches. Other ATMs are located in high-traffic areas such as shopping centers, grocery stores, convenience stores, airports, bus and railway stations, gas stations, casinos, restaurants, and other locations.
Fast Fact
Most ATMs in banks are multifunctional, while off-site ATMs are generally only for cash withdrawals.
ATM Fees
Account holders can typically use their bank’s ATMs at no charge, but an ATM owned by another bank usually charges a fee. According to MoneyRates.com, the average total fees to withdraw cash from an out-of-network ATM was $4.55 in 2022. Some banks will reimburse their customers for the fee, especially if there is no corresponding ATM available in the area.
9
ATM fees can add up for users who make withdrawals regularly. For example, if you make weekly withdrawals at an ATM that charges $4 and is not from your bank, you would pay more than $200 a year in ATM fees.
Using ATMs Outside the U.S.
ATMs make it easier for you to access your checking or savings accounts from almost anywhere in the world when you travel.
Travel experts recommend using foreign ATMs as a source of cash abroad, as they generally receive a more favorable
exchange rate
than they would at most currency exchange offices.
However, the accountholder’s bank may charge a
transaction fee
or a percentage of the amount exchanged. Many ATMs don't list the exchange rate on the receipt, making it difficult to track spending.
How Much Can You Withdraw from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)?
The amount that you can withdraw from an automated teller machine (ATM) per day, per week, or per month will vary based on your bank and account status at that bank. For instance, some banks limit daily cash withdrawals to $300. But most Citibank accounts allow up to $1,500, depending on your account.
10
You may be able to get around these limits by calling your bank to request permission or upgrading your banking status by depositing more funds.
How Do You Make a Deposit at an ATM?
If you are a bank’s customer, you may be able to deposit cash or checks via one of their ATMs. To do this, you may simply need to insert the checks or cash directly into the machine. Other machines may require you to fill out a deposit slip and put the money into an envelope before inserting it into the machine. Be sure to
endorse the back of any checks
and note “For Deposit Only” to be safer.
Which Bank Installed the First ATM in the U.S.?
The first ATM in the U.S. was installed by Chemical Bank in Rockville Center (Long Island), New York, in 1969 (two years after Barclays installed the first ATM in the U.K.). By the end of 1971, more than 1,000 ATMs were installed worldwide.
11
The Bottom Line
ATM, or automated teller machine, is a machine that lets you get cash from your bank account without visiting a teller. Some ATMs are simple cash dispensers, while others allow a variety of transactions such as check deposits, balance transfers, and bill payments. Before you make a withdrawal, make sure you understand what fees you will have to pay.

Investopedia,Unified Managed Account (UMA): Definition and Investment Types,"Close
What Is a Unified Managed Account?
A unified managed account (UMA) is a professionally managed private investment account that can include multiple types of investments all in a single account. Investments may include mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds. Unified managed accounts are often rebalanced on a specified schedule.
Key Takeaways
A unified managed account (UMA) is a privately managed investment account that can include a variety of investments, such as mutual funds, stocks, and bonds.
A UMA is typically rebalanced on a regular schedule, making sure the holdings reflect the correct balance of investments.
It's a type of account often favored by high net worth investors who want a greater range of investments than what they can get with a separately managed account.
UMA providers work with investors to design an integrated portfolio that includes multiple investments, provide support for tax planning, and create an effective rebalancing schedule.
Understanding Unified Managed Account (UMA)
The unified managed account is one of a few options a
high net worth investor
has for managing their assets. The unified managed account is an evolution of the separately managed account, which is similar in that it is a professionally managed account that is rebalanced often. However, separately managed accounts are typically not known for pooling multiple investments and investment vehicles with varying objectives. Separately managed accounts are a high net worth investment alternative, usually offered by an investment manager, that typically focuses on a targeted strategy managed as a separate account for the investor. If an investor wanted to invest across multiple strategies, they would likely have to open multiple separately managed accounts.
A unified managed account is often a better alternative for an investor seeking to combine multiple investments. The UMA removes the need to have more than one account and can combine all of an investor’s assets into one account.
Important
UMA investors pay annual management fees based on the total assets under management (AUM); fees drop as the AUM rise.
Investing Through a Unified Managed Account
The same banks and brokerage firms typically offer unified managed accounts as separately managed accounts. Their offering has also broadened to include registered investment advisors and private wealth managers. Technology has been a driving factor supporting their expansion. A unified managed account provider has a much greater overall fiduciary responsibility since they serve as the overseer for a multitude of investments, which can include stock positions, employee stock option plans, third-party separate account management, and more.
UMA providers work with high net worth investors to integrate all of a client’s assets. Once the assets have been aggregated, a UMA provider will work with the client in a number of ways. The UMA provider can examine the total portfolio for a comprehensive plan. UMA account planning can include an overlay strategy that seeks to manage the portfolio from a targeted asset allocation diversification approach. UMA providers also offer investors new options with affiliated companies and products that an investor may want to invest in over time. Often a UMA provider will analyze the portfolio to conform with modern portfolio theory given the comprehensive, efficient frontier for which the combined assets create. A UMA provider's alternative options may help a client to align their total portfolio for risk-return optimization better.

UMA investors typically pay annual management fees based on total assets under management. Fees usually decrease with greater

The Series 63 exam is a critical qualification for securities professionals in the U.S., focused on state-level securities laws and regulations.
The Series 63, officially known as the Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination, has been a staple of the financial industry for almost half a century. Managed by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), this exam aims to ensure that securities agents understand state-specific regulations and ethical practices.
1
The exam reflects the evolving landscape of financial regulation in the U.S. The Series 63 exam has been instrumental in shaping how securities are sold and who is allowed to sell them, ensuring that financial representatives adhere to ethical standards that protect investors. The exam was born out of necessity—an effort to unify a patchwork of state regulations that once made it almost impossible for brokers to operate across state lines.
Below, we take you through what you need to know about the Series 63, what's on it, and what it means for the professionals who have to take it.
Key Takeaways
Applicants taking the Series 63 license must pass an exam on ethical practices and fiduciary obligations.
Most U.S. states require all potential registered representatives to pass the exam, which covers the principles of state securities regulations and rules prohibiting dishonest or unethical practices.
Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico do not require the Series 63.
Investopedia / Zoe Hansen
Understanding the Series 63
In the late 1970s, as financial markets expanded rapidly, so did the complexity of the regulations governing them. Each state had its own rules, creating a labyrinthine legal environment for securities professionals. Brokers faced the daunting task of navigating inconsistent state laws, which often meant passing multiple exams just to conduct business in neighboring states. Recognizing the problem,
NASAA
introduced the Series 63 exam in 1979 as a standardized test for professionals to qualify across most states.
The Series 63 was more than just a convenience for
brokers
. It represented a significant shift toward regulatory consistency and investor protection. The exam covers the principles of state securities regulation, focusing on rules that prevent fraud, promote transparency, and ensure fair dealing. As financial markets became more interconnected, the importance of a common regulatory framework grew, eventually making the Series 63 a cornerstone for broker registration.

Fast Fact
The Series exams are a group of securities licensing exams administered by FINRA and NASAA. Each is designed to test specific knowledge and skills required for different roles within the securities industry.
The exam tests knowledge of state securities regulations, particularly the rules governing ethical business practices and investor protection. Unlike other exams focusing on federal securities laws, the Series 63 exam emphasizes “blue sky laws” against
financial fraud
that regulate securities at the state level, ensuring that representatives understand the legal obligations they must uphold within individual states.
The exam consists of 60 multiple-choice questions on registration procedures, ethical practices, fiduciary duties, and the handling of client accounts. Candidates must correctly answer at least 43 questions to pass.
2
While the exam is shorter and less comprehensive than other securities exams, like the Series 7, its focus on the legal and ethical framework makes it crucial for those seeking to engage in the securities business across multiple states.
Passing the Series 63 is typically required in addition to other qualifications, like the
Series 6 or Series 7
, making it a foundational credential for anyone looking to sell securities or provide investment advice. The exam's emphasis on state-specific regulations helps ensure that securities professionals can navigate the complexities of different legal environments, ultimately protecting investors and promoting market integrity.
Important
Agents must acquire the Series 63 license, in addition to a Series 7 or Series 6 license, to sell securities.
Series 63 Requirements
Scheduling the Exam
FINRA administers the exam. Here's how you schedule it, depending on your employment:
For broker-dealer employees
: The firm must file an electronic Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer).
3
For individuals not part of a FINRA member firm
: Candidates can independently schedule the exam by opening an enrollment window on FINRA's website and paying a $147 fee.
4
Exam Format
The Series 63 exam consists of 65 multiple-choice questions with four possible answers for each. Of these, 60 are scored, while five are unscored pretest questions. To pass, candidates must correctly answer at least 43 of the 60 scored questions within a 75-minute time limit.
1
The exam is designed to measure a candidate's performance against a predetermined standard, rather than comparing their performance to that of other test-takers. In short, you understand going in what you need to know and how many questions you must get correct to pass.
1
The Series 63 exam employs a method known as ""on-the-fly testing"" to ensure fairness, security, and consistency. Here's what that means:
Each exam is assembled in real time from a large pool of preapproved questions just before it begins.
Questions are selected to meet content specifications. This ensures all required topics are covered in the proportions outlined in the exam blueprint.
The exam is constructed to maintain the same overall difficulty level for all candidates.
Unlike adaptive tests, the Series 63 doesn't adjust the questions' difficulty based on the test-taker's performance.
Each candidate receives a different set of questions to maintain security.
All questions are presented in a fixed order once the exam begins.
The passing score remains constant: 43 out of 60 correct answers.
2
Fast Fact
The Series 63 tests knowledge of so-called ""blue sky laws."" These refer to state laws slowly developed before and during the Great Depression that regulate the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. The phrase derives from a passage in a U.S. Supreme Court case, Hall v. Geiger Jones Co. (1917), that described “speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of ‘blue sky.’""
Retake Policy
After a failed attempt at the Series 63 exam, the following waiting periods apply:
A minimum of 30 days must pass after failing the first exam before the second can be scheduled.
A minimum of 30 days must pass after failing the second attempt before the third can be scheduled.
A minimum of 180 days must pass after failing the third attempt before the fourth (and each subsequent) attempt can be scheduled.
5
Post-Exam Considerations
After passing the Series 63 exam, candidates have two years to obtain a state license; otherwise, the exam results will expire in FINRA's
Central Registration Depository
.
6
The exam remains valid as long as you're registered, with a two-year grace period between jobs. State regulators may grant waivers to individuals who continue working in the financial services industry in a different capacity. While passing the exam may fulfill part of a state's requirements, it doesn't grant the right to conduct business until you're licensed or registered by that state.
Should you need to leave a firm, your employer will file Form U5 to cancel the registration, and then you'll have two years to secure new employment and re-register. The new employer will submit Form U4 for re-registration.
7
Exam Topics
The Series 63 covers eight general subjects related to the professional responsibilities of broker-dealer agents. The subjects, weightings, and number of questions are as follows:

Investopedia,Gross Profit Margin: Formula and What It Tells You,"Close
Definition
Gross profit margin measures a company's profit after subtracting its costs of doing business.
What Is Gross Profit Margin?
Gross profit margin is a financial metric used by analysts to assess a company’s
financial health
. It's the profit remaining after subtracting the
cost of goods sold (COGS)
.
Gross profit margin shows the money a company makes after accounting for its business costs. This metric is usually expressed as a percentage of sales and is also known as the gross margin ratio. A typical profit margin falls between 5% and 10% but it varies widely by industry.
1
Key Takeaways
Gross profit margin is an analytical metric calculated as a company’s net sales minus the cost of goods sold (COGS).
It's often expressed as the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
The gross profit margin shows the profit made before deducting selling, general, and administrative costs which are considered when calculating the firm’s net profit margin.
Gross profit reflects a company's total profit after deducting the costs of doing business.
How Gross Profit Margin Works
Gross profit
is a company's total profit after deducting the cost of doing business, specifically its COGS. It's expressed as a dollar value. Gross profit margin is this profit expressed as a percentage.
Gross profit margin is one of the key metrics that analysts and investors use to assess a company's financial health and efficiency. Companies use gross profit margin to identify areas for cost-cutting and sales improvement. A high gross profit margin indicates efficient operations. A low margin suggests areas needing improvement.
Product pricing
adjustments may influence
gross profit margins. Selling products at a premium typically increases gross margins. High prices may reduce
market share
if fewer customers buy the product, however. This can be a delicate balancing act, requiring careful management to avoid losing customers while maintaining profitability.

Fast Fact
Fluctuating margins might indicate poor management or product issues but they can also reflect justified operational changes such as initial high costs for automation that eventually reduce overall expenses.
Temporary
volatility
shouldn’t be a concern. The initial investment in automating
supply chain
formations might be high but the cost of goods will eventually decrease due to reduced labor costs associated with the automation.
Formula and Calculation of Gross Profit Margin
A company’s
gross profit margin is calculated
using this formula:
2
Gross Profit Margin
=
Net Sales
−
COGS
Net Sales
\begin{aligned} &\text{Gross Profit Margin}=\frac{\text{Net Sales }-\text{ COGS}}{\text{Net Sales}}\\ \end{aligned}
​
Gross Profit Margin
=
Net Sales
Net Sales
−
COGS
​
​
First, subtract the COGS from a company’s net sales. This is its gross revenues minus returns, allowances, and discounts. Then divide this figure by net sales to calculate the gross profit margin as a percentage.
Important
Analysts use a company’s gross profit margin to compare its business model with its competitors. Business owners must understand not just gross profits but also other profit margins as well such as
operating profit margin
and
net profit margin
. This will help them assess their business's profitability after accounting for costs like inventory, salaries, and rent.
3
Gross Profit Margin vs. Other Margins
Gross profit margin is among the key profitability metrics that analysts and investors watch. The other two are net profit margin and operating profit margin.
Net Profit Margin
Net profit margin
is a key financial metric that indicates a company's financial health. It's also known as net margin. It shows the profit generated as a percentage of the company's revenue. Net profit margin is the ratio of its net profit to its revenues.
Management can use the net profit margin to identify business inefficiencies and evaluate the effectiveness of its current
business model
.
Subtract the COGS, operating expenses, other expenses, interest, and taxes from its revenue to calculate a company’s net profit margin. Then divide this figure by the total revenue for the period and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
4
Operating Profit Margin
A company’s operating profit margin or
operating profit
indicates how much profit it generates from its core operations after accounting for all operating expenses.
Subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses,
depreciation
, and
amortization
from total revenue to calculate the operating profit margin. You then express the result as a percentage by dividing by total revenue and multiplying by 100, similar to gross and net profit margins.
5
Example of Gross Profit Margin
Assume that Company ABC and Company XYZ produce widgets with identical characteristics and similar quality levels. Company ABC will command a higher gross margin due to its reduced cost of goods sold if it finds a way to manufacture its product at one-fifth of the cost.
This gives Company ABC a competitive edge in the market. Company XYZ decides to double its product price to compensate for its lower gross margin and boost revenue. This strategy by Company XYZ has a potential downside, however: It might backfire if customers are put off by the higher price. Company XYZ could lose both gross margin and market share in this case.
What Does Gross Profit Margin Indicate?
A company’s gross profit margin indicates how much profit it makes after accounting for the direct costs associated with doing business. It can tell you how well a company turns its sales into a profit. It's the
revenue less the cost
of goods sold which includes labor and materials and it's expressed as a percentage.
What’s the Difference Between a High and Low Gross Profit Margin?
Companies strive for high gross profit margins because they indicate greater degrees of profitability. It means that a company operates efficiently when it has a higher profit margin. It can keep itself at this level as long as its operating expenses remain in check.
A lower gross profit margin is a cause for concern. It can impact a company’s
bottom line
and it means that there are areas that can be improved.
How Does a Company Increase Its Gross Profit Margin?
A company can increase its gross profit margin and its profitability in several ways. These include:
Reducing its operating expenses without lowering sales prices
Increasing its prices without increasing the cost of doing business
Improving its productivity and efficiencies
Relying on its existing customers to increase its average order value
The Bottom Line
It's smart for
investors
to look at key financial metrics so they can make well-informed decisions about the companies they add to their
portfolios
. One important metric is the gross profit margin which you can calculate by subtracting the cost of goods sold from a company’s revenue. Both figures are available on a company's income statement.
A higher gross profit margin indicates a more profitable and efficient company. Comparing companies' margins within the same industry is essential, however, because this allows for a fair assessment due to similar operational variables.

What Are Fringe Benefits?
Fringe benefits are additions to compensation that employers offer workers to recruit, motivate, and retain high-quality talent. Examples include a company car, paid time off, and a gym membership.
Key Takeaways
Fringe benefits help employers recruit, motivate, and retain high-quality employees.
Employers competing for the most in-demand skills tend to offer the most benefits.
Some common benefits, like health and life insurance, are not taxable, but others are taxed at fair market value.
Investopedia / NoNo Flores
Understanding Fringe Benefits
Common fringe benefits are basic items that are often included in hiring packages. These include
health insurance
,
life insurance
, tuition assistance, childcare reimbursement, cafeteria subsidies, below-market loans, employee discounts,
employee stock options
, and use of a company-owned vehicle.
Uncommon fringe benefits may fit the company profile. PetSmart, for example, has a pet-friendly workplace. Ben & Jerry's rewards its workers with free ice cream.
1
The companies that compete for the best talent in highly competitive fields may offer the most extraordinary fringe benefits. Google's parent company, Alphabet, provides free commuter bus service and a free gourmet cafeteria.

Tax Considerations
Fringe benefits are taxable unless they are specifically exempted. If you receive
taxable fringe benefits
, you must include their
fair market value
in your taxable income for the year. The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
maintains a list called the
Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits
. The list of fringe benefits excluded from income taxes includes:
4
Accident and health benefits
Achievement awards (up to $1,600 for qualified awards)
Adoption assistance
Athletic facilities
Commuting benefits
De minimis (minimal) benefits
Dependent care assistance
Educational assistance
Employee discounts
Employee stock options
Employer-provided cell phones
Group-term life insurance coverage
Health savings accounts (HSAs)
Lodgings on business premises
Meals
No-additional-cost services
Retirement planning services
Tuition reduction
Working conditions benefits
All of these exemptions are subject to certain and often complex conditions. For example, achievement awards are only exempt up to a value of $1,600 for qualified plan awards and a value of $400 for non-qualified plan awards.
5
Qualified plan awards are open to all employees, not just highly paid employees. Other exemptions are not available to highly compensated employees if the benefits are given to them but not rank-and-file employees. These include employee discounts, adoption assistance, and dependent care assistance. Most but not all fringe benefits that are income tax-exempt are also exempt from Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes.

Fast Fact
The companies that compete for the best talent in highly competitive fields may offer the most extraordinary fringe benefits.
Valuing Fringe Benefits
Any fringe benefit not named above, or any of the benefits named above that does not conform to IRS rules for exemption, is taxable. The exemption rules are complex, also.
For example, working condition benefits are taxable to the extent that they are for personal use. If an employee is given a laptop, the taxable income would be the percentage of the laptop's fair market value devoted to personal use. If 80% of its use is personal, the taxable income is 80% of the value of the computer.
In general, fringe benefits are valued at fair market value. This is the amount the employee would pay for the same benefit at retail.
Are Fringe Benefits Taxable?
Any fringe benefit an employer provides is taxable and must be included in the recipient's pay unless the law expressly excludes it.
4
What Is a Cafeteria Plan?
A
cafeteria plan
refers to a suite of fringe benefits that allows employees to choose among them. Often, these benefits will come out of pre-tax dollars. They may include insurance plans and
retirement
benefits. The name cafeteria is used because it is akin to a menu of benefits that can be selected or passed over, like at a cafeteria buffet.
Is a Lifetime Achievement Award Given to an Employee Taxable?
An achievement award may be excluded from taxation as a fringe benefit if it meets specific criteria. For example, it must be worth less than $1,600 and cannot be cash or cash equivalents such as a gift certificate or a gift card. It also cannot be stocks, bonds, or other securities. The exclusion doesn't include vacations, meals, lodging, and tickets to theater or sporting events.
4
The Bottom Line
Fringe benefits are additional incentives that employers offer to attract and retain talent. They range widely, from gym memberships to pet-friendly workplaces.

Investopedia,"Yield Basis: What it Means, How it Works","Close
What Is Yield Basis?
The yield basis is a method of quoting the price of a
fixed-income security
as a yield percentage, rather than as a dollar value. This allows bonds with varying characteristics to be easily compared. The yield basis is calculated by dividing the coupon amount paid annually by the
bond
purchase price.
Key Takeaways
The yield basis method quotes the price of a fixed-income security (such as a bond) as a yield percentage instead of a dollar value.
The yield basis method helps bond buyers easily compare the characteristics of various bonds before making a purchase.
The yield quote tells the bond trader whether the bond is currently trading at a discount or premium compared to other bonds.
Purchasing a bond on a net yield basis means the yield also includes the broker's profit or markup for executing the trade.
Understanding Yield Basis
Unlike stocks, which are quoted in dollars, most bonds are quoted with a yield basis. For example, assume a company is listed with a 6.75%
coupon rate
and is set to mature 10 years from the date of issuance. The $1,000 par bond is trading at a dollar value of $940.
The yield basis can be calculated using the
current yield
formula presented as:
1
Coupon / Purchase Price
Following our example above, the coupon to be paid annually is 6.75% x $1,000 = $67.50. Therefore, the yield basis is $67.50 / $940 = 0.0718, or 7.18%. The bond will be quoted to investors as having a yield basis of 7.18%.
The yield quote tells a bond trader that the bond is currently trading
at a discount
because its yield basis is greater than its coupon rate (6.75%). If the yield basis is less than the coupon rate, this would indicate that the bond is trading
at a premium
since a higher coupon rate increases the value of the bond in the markets.
2
A bond trader could then compare the bond to others within a certain industry.
Bank Discount Yield
The yield basis of a pure discount instrument can be calculated using the
bank discount yield
formula, which is:
r = (Discount / Par Value) x (360/t) where
r = Annualized yield
Discount = Par value minus purchase price
t = time left to maturity
360 = Bank convention for the number of days in a year
Unlike the current yield, the bank discount yield takes the discount
value from par
and expresses it as a fraction of the par value, not the current price, of the bond. This method of calculating the yield basis assumes simple interest; that is, no compounding effect is factored in.
Treasury bills
are
quoted only on a bank discount basis
.
3
For example, assume a Treasury bill with a $1,000 face value is selling for $970. If its time to maturity is 180 days, the yield basis will be:
r = [($1,000 - $970)/$1,000] x (360/180)
r = ($30/$1,000) x 2
r = 0.06 or 6%
As Treasury bills pay no coupon, the bondholder will earn a dollar return equal to the discount if the bond is held until it matures.
Special Considerations
When purchasing bonds, it's important for the investor to understand the difference between the yield basis and the net yield basis. On the
secondary market
, you can purchase bonds through a broker/dealer, who could charge you a flat commission for this service. However, in lieu of a commission, your broker may opt to sell bonds on a net yield basis.
Net yield means the yield also includes the broker's profit for the transaction. This is the broker's
markup
, which is the difference between what the broker paid for the bonds and what the
broker sells
them for. If a broker offers bonds on a net yield basis, they've already included their markup. For example, if an online broker sells you a bond with a 3.75%
yield to maturity (YTM)
, their profit is embedded directly in the price you pay and there is no separate commission.
When comparing various bonds for a possible purchase, bond buyers should ask their broker if the bonds are on a net yield basis or if they charge a separate commission to execute the trade. Brokers might charge other fees, such as a broker-assisted fee for transactions not conducted online. Your overall cost for the trade may also include
accrued interest
, which is the interest accrued on the bond between the last payment and the settlement date.

Investopedia,"Volcker Rule: Definition, Purpose, How It Works, and Criticism","Close
What Is the Volcker Rule?
The Volcker Rule is a federal regulation that prohibits banks from conducting certain investment activities with their own accounts and limits their dealings with hedge funds and private equity funds. The rule was part of the larger set of reform legislation enacted in 2010 and known as the Dodd-Frank Act.
Key Takeaways
The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from using their own accounts for short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, as well as options on any of these instruments.
In June 2020, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) officials announced a loosening of the restrictions of the Volcker Rule, allowing banks to more easily make large investments into venture capital and similar funds.
1
Critics of the Volcker Rule argue that it reduces liquidity by restricting banks’ market-making activities.
Understanding the Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule aims to protect bank customers by preventing banks from making certain types of speculative investments that contributed to the 2007–2008
financial crisis
.
Essentially, it prohibits banks from using their own accounts for short-term
proprietary trading
of securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, as well as options on any of these instruments.
In August 2019, the U.S.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) voted to amend the Volcker Rule in an attempt to clarify what securities trading was and was not allowed by banks.

The Volcker Rule aims to protect bank customers by preventing banks from making certain types of speculative investments that contributed to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
In addition, banks will not have to set aside as much cash for
derivatives
trades among different units of the same firm. That requirement had been put in place in the original rule to ensure that banks wouldn’t get wiped out if speculative derivative bets went wrong.

The Volcker Rule is named after economist Paul Volcker, who was Federal Reserve chairman from 1979 to 1987. Volcker died on Dec. 8, 2019, at age 92.
4
The Volcker Rule refers to section 619 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
of 2010, which sets forth rules for implementing section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.
5
The Volcker Rule also bars banks from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in hedge funds or private equity funds, subject to certain exemptions.
6
The rule aims to discourage banks from taking too much risk by barring them from using their own funds to make these types of investments.
""Streamlining"" the Volcker Rule
The rule went into effect on April 1, 2014, with banks’ full compliance required by July 21, 2015—although the Fed has since set procedures for banks to request extended time to transition into full compliance for certain activities and investments.
7
On May 30, 2018, Fed board members, led by Chair Jerome Powell, voted unanimously to push forward a proposal to loosen the restrictions around the Volcker Rule and reduce the costs for banks that need to comply with it.
8
The goal, according to Powell, was “...to replace overly complex and inefficient requirements with a more streamlined set of requirements.”
9
The rule, as it exists, allows banks to continue
market making
,
underwriting
,
hedging
, trading government securities, engaging in insurance company activities, offering
hedge funds
and private equity funds, and acting as agents, brokers, or
custodians
.
Banks may continue to offer these services to their customers to generate profits. However, banks cannot engage in these activities if doing so would create a material
conflict of interest
, expose the institution to high-risk assets or trading strategies, or generate instability within the bank or the overall U.S. financial system.
Depending on their size, banks must meet varying levels of reporting requirements to disclose details of their trading activities to the government. Larger institutions must implement a program to ensure compliance with the new rules, and their programs are subject to independent testing and analysis. Smaller institutions are subject to lesser compliance and reporting requirements.
10
Enacting the Volcker Rule
The rule’s origins date back to 2009, when Volcker proposed a piece of regulation in response to the ongoing financial crisis, and after the nation’s largest banks accumulated large losses from their proprietary trading arms.
The proposed legislation aimed to prohibit banks from speculating in the markets. Volcker ultimately hoped to reestablish the divide between
commercial banking
and
investment banking
—a division that once existed but was legally dissolved by a partial repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act
in 1999.
Although not a part of then-President Barack Obama’s original proposal for financial overhaul, the Volcker Rule was endorsed by Obama and added to the proposal by Congress in January 2010.
11
In December 2013, five federal agencies—the Board of Governors of the Fed; the FDIC; the OCC; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—approved the final regulations that make up the Volcker Rule.
7
Important
A bank may be excluded from the Volcker Rule if it does not have more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and does not have total trading assets and liabilities of 5% or more of total consolidated assets.
Criticism of the Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule has been widely criticized from various angles. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce claimed in 2017 that a cost-benefit analysis was never done and that the costs associated with the Volcker Rule outweigh its benefits.
12
That same year, the top risk official of the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said that regulations to prevent speculative bets are hard to enforce and that the Volcker Rule could unintentionally diminish liquidity in the bond market.
13
The Fed’s Finance and Economics Discussion Series (FEDS) made a similar argument, saying that the Volcker Rule will reduce liquidity by reducing the banks’ market-making activities.
14
Meanwhile, several reports have cited a lighter-than-expected impact on the revenues of big banks in the years following the rule’s enactment.
Recent Developments
In February 2017, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to review existing financial system regulations.
15
In response to the order, Treasury officials released multiple reports proposing changes to Dodd-Frank, including a recommended proposal to allow banks greater exemptions under the Volcker Rule.
In one of the reports, released in June 2017, the Treasury said it recommended significant changes to the Volcker Rule while adding that it does not support its repeal and “supports in principle” the rule’s limitations on proprietary trading. The report notably recommends exempting from the Volcker Rule banks with less than $10 billion in assets.
The Treasury also cited regulatory compliance burdens created by the rule and suggested simplifying and refining the definitions of proprietary trading and covered funds on top of softening the regulation to allow banks to more easily hedge their risks.
16
In June 2020, bank regulators loosened one of the Volcker Rule provisions to allow lenders to invest in venture capital funds and other assets.
1
After taking office in 2020, newly-elected President Joseph
Biden set to work
to reverse the Trump administration's diminutions to the financial system regulations, though no significant changes to the Volcker Rule were finalized during his term.
With the return of Donald Trump to the presidency, the big banks were anticipating a ""general deregulatory environment,"" according to The Banker.
17
What Was the Goal of the Volcker Rule?
The purpose of the Volcker Rule was to prevent the banks from engaging in the kind of high-risk investing that led to the financial collapse of 2008-2009.
Essentially, it prohibits banks from using their own accounts (which consist of their customers' deposits) for short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, as well as options on any of these instruments.
6
Volcker ultimately hoped to reestablish the divide between commercial banking and investment banking—a division that had been dissolved by a partial repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999.
What Are the Main Criticisms of the Volcker Rule?
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce claimed in 2017 that the costs associated with the Volcker Rule outweigh its benefits.
12
The Fed’s Finance and Economics Discussion Series (FEDS) argued that the Volcker Rule will reduce liquidity due to a reduction in banks’ market-making activities. During the first Trump administration, the Treasury Department largely supported the retention of the Volcker Rule but recommended some loosening to make it less onerous to comply with.
14
What Was the Glass-Steagall Act?
The Glass-Steagall Act was a landmark piece of financial industry regulation that was spurred by the failure of almost 5,000 American banks during the
Great Depression
. Enacted as part of the Banking Act of 1933, the bill was sponsored by Sen. Carter Glass, a former Treasury secretary, and Rep. Henry Steagall, chair of the House Banking and Currency Committee.
Glass-Steagall prohibited commercial banks from participating in the investment banking business and vice versa.

Definition
The income statement is a financial report that summarizes a company's financial performance over a specific accounting period. It includes a company's revenue, expenses, and net income.
What Is an Income Statement?
An income statement is a financial report used by a business. It tracks the company's revenue, expenses, gains, and losses during a set period. Also known as the profit and loss (P&L) statement or the statement of revenue and expense, it provides valuable insights into a company's operations, the efficiency of its management, underperforming sectors, and its performance relative to industry peers.
The income statement is one of the three important financial statements used for reporting a company's financial performance over a set accounting period. The other two key statements are the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.
Key Takeaways
An income statement shows a business's revenue, expenses, gains, and losses, starting with revenue and ending with net income.
Other financial statements used by businesses are the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
An income statement provides insight into a company's operations, efficiency, management, and performance relative to others in the same sector.
The income statement can be presented in a single-step or multi-step format.
Mira Norian / Investopedia
Understanding the Income Statement
The income statement is an integral part of company performance reports. While the balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financials as of a particular date, the income statement reports income through a specific period, usually a quarter or a year.
Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi
The income statement gives an account of how the
net revenue
realized by the company is transformed into net earnings (profit or loss). This requires reporting four key items: revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. An income statement starts with the details of sales and then works down to compute net income and eventually earnings per share (EPS). In each line, the income statement does not differentiate between cash and non-cash receipts (sales in cash vs. sales on credit) or cash vs. non-cash payments/disbursements (purchases in cash vs. purchases on credit).
The period the income statement covers is indicated in its heading. For example, it could read: ""for the year ended January 31, 2024"", which would be the company's fiscal year, or ""three months ended March 31, 2024"", which means the first three months of the calendar year.

A publicly traded company must submit income statements to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC).
1
Parts of an Income Statement
The format of an income statement may vary, depending upon the local regulatory requirements, the diversified scope of the business, and the associated operating activities. However, regardless of format, certain information will be present.
Operating Revenue
Revenue realized through primary activities is often referred to as
operating revenue
. For a company manufacturing a product, or for a wholesaler, distributor, or retailer involved in the business of selling that product, the revenue from primary activities refers to revenue achieved from the sale of the product.
Similarly, for a company (or its franchisees) in the business of offering services, revenue from primary activities refers to the revenue or fees earned in exchange for offering those services.
Non-Operating Revenue
Revenue realized through secondary, noncore business activities is often referred to as nonoperating, recurring revenue. This revenue is sourced from the earnings that are outside the purchase and sale of goods and services, such as income from:
Interest earned on business capital in the bank
Renting business property
Strategic partnerships like royalty payments
Advertisements placed on business property
Gains
Also called
other sundry income
, gains indicate the net money made from other activities like the sale of long-term assets. These include the net income realized from one-time nonbusiness activities, such as a company selling its old transportation van, unused land, or a subsidiary company.
Revenue should not be confused with receipts. Payment is usually accounted for in the period when sales are made or services are delivered. Receipts are the cash received and are accounted for when the money is received.
For example, a customer may take goods or services from a company on September 28, which will result in revenue accounted for in September. The customer may be given a 30-day payment window due to their excellent credit and reputation, allowing until October 28 to make the payment, which is when the receipts are accounted for.
Fast Fact
A business's cost to continue operating and turning a profit is known as an expense. Some of these expenses may be written off on a tax return if they meet Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines.
Primary-Activity Expenses
These are all expenses incurred for earning the average operating revenue linked to the primary activity of the business. They include the cost of goods sold (COGS), selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, depreciation or amortization, and research and development (R&D) expenses. Typical items that make up the list are:
Employee wages
Sales commissions
Utilities
Transportation
Secondary-Activity Expenses
These are all expenses linked to non-core business activities, like
interest
paid on loan money. They may be recurring or happen only once.
Losses As Expenses
These are all expenses that go toward a loss-making sale of long-term assets, one-time or any other unusual costs, or expenses toward lawsuits.
Income Statement Structure
Mathematically, net income is calculated based on the following:
Net Income = (Revenue + Gains) - (Expenses + Losses)
To understand the above formula with some real numbers, let’s assume that a fictitious sports merchandise business, which additionally provides training, is reporting its income statement for a recent hypothetical quarter.
Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang
The company generated $25,800 from the sale of sports goods and $5,000 from training services for a total of $30,800 in revenue. However, that money didn't stay in its pocket. Generating that revenue cost a total of $10,650. Major expenses included procurement costs, rent, and wages.
The company also realized a net gain of $2,000 from the sale of an old van and incurred a loss of $800 for settling a dispute raised by a consumer.
If you subtract all the outgoings from the money the company received, you are left with $21,350. That's the company's net income for the given quarter.
Single-Step vs. Multiple-Step Income Statement
The above example is the simplest form of income statement that any standard business can generate. It is called the
single-step income statement
as it is based on a simple calculation that sums up revenue and gains and subtracts expenses and losses.
However, real-world companies often operate on a global scale, have diversified business segments offering a mix of products and services, and frequently get involved in mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships. Such a wide array of operations, diversified set of expenses, various business activities, and the need for reporting in a standard format per regulatory compliance lead to multiple and complex accounting entries in the income statement.
In a multi-step income statement for a large corporation, the measures of profitability are reported at four different levels in a business's operations: gross, operating, pretax, and after-tax. This segregation helps in identifying how the income and profitability are moving/changing from one level to the other. For instance, high gross profit but lower operating income indicates higher expenses, while higher pretax profit and lower post-tax profit indicate loss of earnings to taxes and other one-time, unusual expenses.
Listed companies follow the multiple-step income statement, which segregates the operating revenue, operating expenses, and gains from the nonoperating revenue, nonoperating expenses, and losses, as well as offering many more details.

What Is a Jumbo Loan?
A jumbo loan, also known as a jumbo mortgage, is a type of home mortgage that exceeds the lending limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for conventional mortgages. Unlike those mortgages, a jumbo loan is not eligible to be purchased, guaranteed, or
securitized
by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
1
Lenders offer jumbo loans to finance luxury properties and homes in very expensive local real estate markets and have more stringent
underwriting
requirements for them.
Key Takeaways
A jumbo loan, also known as a jumbo mortgage, is a type of financing that exceeds the limits set by the
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
and cannot be purchased, guaranteed, or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
Borrowers must meet more rigorous credit requirements than those who apply for a conventional loan.
Approval requires a stellar credit score and a very low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
The average annual percentage rate (APR) for a jumbo mortgage is often on par with conventional mortgages.
Advantages and Disadvantages of a Jumbo Loan
The primary advantage of a jumbo loan is that it allows borrowers to take out a
mortgage
that exceeds the
conforming loan limits
put in place by the FHFA.
The conforming loan limit for single-family homes in 2024 is $766,550 in most of the U.S. but as high as $1,149,825 in some places.
2
3
If you have your sights set on a home that costs close to a million dollars or more—and you don't have that much cash sitting in a bank account—you'll probably need a jumbo mortgage.
Higher Loan Limits, Higher Costs
However, if you're trying to obtain a jumbo loan, you'll face more exacting credit requirements than homeowners applying for a conventional loan. That's because jumbo mortgages carry more risk for the lender since there is no guarantee by
Fannie Mae
or
Freddie Mac
. There's also more risk simply because more money is involved.
Jumbo loans are also more expensive to acquire. For example,
closing costs
and origination fees are typically calculated on a percentage of the sale, which adds up quickly on higher-priced properties.
4
5
Borrowers also get fewer tax breaks on larger mortgages. In 2024, the mortgage interest deduction cap was $750,000 for properties purchased after Dec. 16, 2017. If you hold a mortgage worth $1 million or more, you'll only be able to deduct interest on the first $750,000 of the loan.
6
Pros and Cons of a Jumbo Loan
Pros
Higher loan amounts
Similar interest rates to conforming loans
Less hassle than obtaining multiple mortgages
Cons
More stringent credit and financial requirements
Higher closing costs
Mortgage interest deduction limited to first $750,000
How a Jumbo Loan Works
Like traditional mortgages, the credit requirements for obtaining a jumbo mortgage have become increasingly stringent since the financial crisis of 2008. To get approved, you'll need a stellar
credit score
—700 or above—and a favorable
debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
. Although they are
nonconforming mortgages
, jumbos still must meet the guidelines of what
Regulation Z
of the federal Truth in Lending Act defines as a ""qualified mortgage,"" based on the borrower's DTI and other factors.
7
You'll need to prove that you have sufficient income and cash reserves to cover your payments. The specifics will depend on the size of the loan, but all borrowers are likely to need to provide at least 30 days of recent pay stubs, 60 days of recent bank statements, and two years of annual tax returns and W-2 forms. If you're self-employed, the documentation requirements can be greater.
8
The borrower also needs sufficient provable
liquid assets
to qualify, in addition to cash reserves equal to six to 12 months of the mortgage payments. They must also provide documentation of their nonliquid assets (like other real estate) and of any other loans they hold.
Jumbo Loan Interest Rates
While jumbo mortgages used to carry significantly
higher interest rates
than conventional mortgages, the gap has been closing in recent years. Today, the average
annual percentage rate (APR)
for a jumbo mortgage is often on a par with conventional mortgages—and in some cases, actually lower. As of Sept 20, 2024, the
average 30-year fixed-rate conventional loan
offered an APR of 6.01%, while the same term in a jumbo loan averaged 6.32%.
Note
Even though the
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't handle them, jumbo loans are often securitized by other financial institutions for sale to investors.
Down Payments on Jumbo Loans
Down payment
requirements on jumbo loans have also loosened over the years. At one time, lenders routinely required 30% down payments, compared with 20% or less for conventional mortgages. Now, that figure has fallen to as low as 10% in some cases.
9
As with any mortgage, there can be advantages to making a higher down payment—among them avoiding avoid the cost of
private mortgage insurance (PMI)
, which lenders require for loans with down payments under 20%.
Good Candidates for Jumbo Loans
These mortgages are considered most appropriate for high-income earners who make at least $250,000 to $500,000 a year but lack the cash to buy an expensive home outright. This segment is sometimes referred to as HENRYs, an acronym for
high earners, not rich yet
.
These are just the sorts of individuals that financial institutions love to sign up for long-term products, partly because they often need (and will pay for) additional
wealth management
services. Plus, it's more economical for a bank to administer a single $2 million mortgage than 10 loans valued at $200,000 apiece.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What Is Considered a Jumbo Loan?
A loan is considered jumbo if it exceeds the maximum loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming loans—currently $766,550 for single-family homes in most parts of the U.S. but up to $1,149,825 in certain more expensive areas.
3
What Are the Requirements to Get a Jumbo Loan?
To be approved, you'll typically need a high credit score—700 or above—a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, and evidence of sufficient income and assets to keep up with the payments.
What Is the Down Payment on a Jumbo Loan?
In some cases you may be able to obtain a jumbo loan with a down payment as low as 10%. In others, a lender might require 25% or 30%.
The Bottom Line
A jumbo loan, also known as a jumbo mortgage, is a type of financing that exceeds the conventional loan limits set by the government for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Would-be borrowers face more rigorous credit requirements than those applying for a conventional loan, including an excellent credit score and a very low DTI ratio. Jumbo loans can make sense for borrowers with substantial incomes who lack the cash to buy an expensive home outright or would rather use their cash for other purposes.

Investopedia,"Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return Definition, Types, and Use","Close
What Is Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return?
Individual taxpayers use Form 1040, a standard
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
form, to file their annual income tax returns. Form 1040 is divided into sections that let you report your taxable income for the year, as well as your deductions, in order to calculate how much you owe in taxes or receive as a refund.
Key Takeaways
Form 1040 is what individual taxpayers use to file their taxes with the IRS.
The form determines if additional taxes are due or if the filer will receive a tax refund.
Taxpayers must include personal information on Form 1040, such as name, address, Social Security number, and the number of dependents.
A filer also needs to report wages, salary, taxable interest, capital gains, pensions, Social Security benefits, and other types of income.
Taxpayers may need to file supplemental tax 1040 forms depending on their situation.
Who Can File Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return?
Form 1040 needs to be filed with the IRS by April 15 in most years. Everyone who earns income over a certain threshold must file an
income tax
return with the IRS. Keep in mind that businesses have different forms to report their profits.
1
2
If a United States citizen wants or needs to file a federal income tax return, they need to file Form 1040 or a variation of Form 1040 (see ""Types of Form 1040,"" below). Who must file is dependent upon three general conditions.
First, the IRS requires individuals with certain levels of
gross income
to file taxes. This threshold varies based on the individual's filing status and age. The table below lists the income limits for individuals under 65 years old.
3
4
Keep in mind that older taxpayers tend to have higher thresholds, and the threshold changes if neither, one, or both individuals in a marriage are 65 or older.
5
2024 Gross Income Thresholds (Filed in 2025)
Filing Status
Gross Income
Single
$14,600
Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow(er)
$29,200
Head of Household
$21,900
Individuals with gross income above these amounts are required to file 2024 federal income taxes.
2025 Gross Income Thresholds (Filed in 2026)
Filing Status
Gross Income
Single
$15,000
Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow(er)
$30,000
Head of Household
$22,500
Individuals with the gross income amounts above are required to file 2025 federal income taxes.
Second, children and dependents may not be required to file if they can be claimed as a dependent. In 2024, if the dependent's unearned income is greater than $1,300 ($1,350
in 2025) but under $13,000 ($13,500 in 2025); their earned income is greater than $14,600 ($15,000 in 2025); or gross income meets certain thresholds, the dependent must file their own Form 1040.
6
7
These rules are slightly different for single dependents as opposed to dependents who are married.
8
Third, some specific situations require an individual to file Form 1040. Regardless of their income or dependency status, some of those situations include but are not limited to:
9
You owe additional special taxes such as alternative minimum tax
You receive
health savings account (HSA)
or other health account distributions
You had net earnings from self-employment of at least $400
You met the income threshold limits for
wages earned from a church
How to File Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return
Form 1040 is available on the IRS website and has two pages that must be filled out. Form 1040 can be mailed in or e-filed. Tax filers are asked for their
filing status
along with their personal information, such as their name, address, Social Security number (some information on one's spouse may also be needed), and the number of their dependents.
10
The form also asks whether the taxpayer wishes to contribute $3 to presidential campaign funds.
10
The 1040 income section asks the filer to report wages, salary, taxable interest, capital gains, pensions, Social Security benefits, and other types of income. Tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017
eliminated many deductions
, including unreimbursed employee expenses, tax-preparation fees, and the cost of moving for a job (except for military on active duty).
11
12
The form uses what the IRS terms a building block approach and allows taxpayers to add only the
schedules
they need to their tax returns. Some individuals may need to file one or more of six supplemental schedules with their 1040 in addition to long-standing schedules for items like
business income
or loss.
13
This depends on whether they're claiming tax credits or owe additional taxes. Many individual taxpayers, however, only need to file a 1040 and no schedules
.
IRS
IRS Form 1040
Types of Form 1040
Taxpayers in certain situations may need to file a different variant of the 1040 form instead of the standard version. Below are the options.
Form 1040-NR
Certain
nonresident aliens
or their representatives need to file this form, including:
14
Those who are engaged in trade or business in the United States
Representatives of a deceased person who would have had to file a Form 1040-NR
Those who represent an
estate or trust
that had to file a 1040-NR
The IRS also produces the 1040-SS and 1040-PR. The 1040-SS is for residents of American Samoa, the CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands who have net
self-employment
income and do not have to file Form 1040 with the U.S. Form 1040-PR is the Spanish-language equivalent of Form 1040-SS.
15
16
Form 1040-ES
This form is used to determine and pay estimated quarterly taxes. The estimated tax applies to income that isn’t subject to withholding, which includes earnings from self-employment, interest, dividends, and rents. This may also include
unemployment
compensation, pension income, and the taxable portion of Social Security benefits.
17
Form 1040-V
This is a statement accompanying a taxpayer's payment for any balance on the ""Amount you owe"" line of the 1040 or 1040-NR.
18
Form 1040-X
If a filer makes a mistake or forgets to include information on any 1040 form,
Form 1040-X
is used for making changes to previously filed 1040s.
19
Form 1040-SR
The IRS introduced a new 1040 form in 2019,
Form 1040-SR
, which is designed for taxpayers over the age of 65. Changes include a larger font, no shading (shaded sections can be hard to read), and a standard deduction chart that includes the extra standard deduction for taxpayers over 65. Taxpayers in this age bracket who fill out their taxes online won't see a difference, but those who do it on paper will.
20
Standard Deductions on Form 1040
The 1040 income section asks taxpayers for their filing status. This determines the taxpayer's
standard deduction
. The table below highlights the deductions for the 2024 and 2025 tax years. Keep in mind that you file 2024 taxes in 2025 and 2025 taxes in 2026.
21
22
Standard Deductions
Filing Status
2024
2025
Single or Married Filing Separately
$14,600
$15,000
Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow(er)
$29,200
$30,000
Head of Household
$21,900
$22,500
An additional deduction may be taken by those
who are age 65 or older or blind
. Just like the standard deduction, these figures are adjusted annually for inflation.
Aged or blind: $1,550 in 2024 increased to $1,950 if the individual is also unmarried and not a surviving spouse. These amounts increase to $1,600 and $2,000, respectively, in 2025.
23
24
Important
The standard deduction cannot be taken by an estate or trust, an individual who is filing a short return due to a change in accounting periods, an individual who was a nonresident alien part of the tax year, or a married individual whose spouse is filing separately and itemizing.
25
Additional Schedules
As noted above, Form 1040 uses a variety of additional schedules to help taxpayers report their tax obligations. The following schedules are used to compile financial information away from Form 1040 to later use with Form 1040 as the primary source of reporting.
Schedule 1
Schedule 1 is used to report additional income or adjustments to income. This may include
alimony
, disposition proceeds from the sale of a business, educator expenses, health savings account (HSA) contributions, or unemployment compensation.
26
It's important to note that:
10
Other Income from Schedule 1: This is reported on Line 8 of Form 1040
Adjustments to Income from Schedule 1: This is reported on Line 10 of Form 1040
Schedule 2
Schedule 2 is used to report additional taxes. One part of Schedule 2 reports alternative minimum tax and repayment of excess premium tax credits for insurance bought through
health insurance marketplaces
.
27
Another part of Schedule 2 is used to report self-employment taxes, Medicare taxes, taxes on
individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
, household employment taxes, and other taxes. These two parts from Schedule 2 are reported on Line 17 and Line 23 on Form 1040.
10
27
Schedule 3
Schedule 3 is used to report additional tax credits and payments. These credits include dependent care expense credits,
residential energy credits
, excess Social Security taxes previously remitted, and excess federal income taxes previously remitted.
28
Nonrefundable credits from Schedule 3 are reported on Line 20 of Form 1040, while refundable credits from Schedule 3 are reported on Line 31 of Form 1040.
10
28
Schedule A (Itemized Deductions)
Schedule A is used to figure out a taxpayer's
itemized deduction
. A taxpayer's federal income liability is most often minimized when choosing the larger of their standard deduction or itemized deduction.
29
The itemized deduction calculation includes medical expenses, dental expenses, certain taxes, certain interest assessments, theft losses, and other expenses. Any input from Schedule A is entered into Line 12a on Form 1040.
10
29
Schedule B (Interest and Ordinary Dividends)
Schedule B is used for taxpayers who received greater than $1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends. It is also used to report interest from a
seller-financed mortgage
, accrued interest from a b",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp
Investopedia,What Is a White Paper?,"Close
Definition
White papers can be used to launch a product, highlight a problem to solicit solutions, or provide technical specifications.
What Is a White Paper?
A white paper is an informational document issued by a company or not-for-profit organization to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service that it offers or will introduce. A
startup
, a large corporation, or a government agency will use white papers differently.
Key Takeaways
A white paper promotes a certain product, service, or methodology to influence current and prospective customers or investors.
Three types of white papers include backgrounders, numbered lists, and problem/solution white papers.
White papers are commonly designed for business-to-business (B2B) marketing purposes between a manufacturer and a wholesaler, or between a wholesaler and a retailer.
Using a White Paper
White papers are sales and marketing documents used to entice or persuade potential customers to explore a particular product, service, technology, or methodology. A white paper may communicate an organization’s philosophy or present research findings related to an industry.
White papers are commonly designed for
business-to-business (B2B)
marketing purposes between a manufacturer and a
wholesaler
, or between a wholesaler and a retailer. The information presented in white papers is often backed by research and statistics from reliable sources and may include charts, graphs, tables, and other ways of visualizing data.
Types
Backgrounders
: Detail the technical features of a new product or service. Designed to simplify complicated technical information, they are used to support a technical evaluation, launch a product, or promote a product or industry leader.
Numbered lists
: Highlight the key takeaways of a new product or service, and are often formatted with headings and bullet points, or with formats like ""3 Questions to Ask,"" or ""5 Things You Need to Know.""
Problem/solution papers
: Identify specific problems faced by potential customers and suggest a data-driven argument about how a featured product or service provides a solution to generate new sales, educate salespeople on product characteristics, or build industry interest.
Fast Fact
White papers are commonly 2,500 words or more in length and written in an academic style.
1
Writing a White Paper
White papers differ from other
marketing
materials, such as brochures. Brochures and traditional marketing materials might be flashy and obvious, but a white paper is intended to provide factual evidence that solves a problem or challenge.

A white paper should provide well-researched information that is not found with a simple Internet search and has a compelling narrative to keep the reader’s attention. The author of a white paper should:
Research and fully define the topic
Create an accurate outline of information
Write an attention-grabbing introduction
Format the paper for easy reading
Revise and proofread
Examples
All of the documents listed below and publicly available on Microsoft’s website focus on aspects of the company’s suite of cloud services. In contrast with brochures, these white papers don’t have a clear sales pitch. Instead, they dive into relevant topics, such as cloud security, hybrid clouds, and the economic benefits of adopting cloud computing.
Digital Transformation and the Art of the Possible
Harvard Business Review Analytic Services: Drive Agility and Innovation with ERP in the Cloud
IDC: The Business Value of Migrating and Modernizing with Azure
How Have New Industries Used White Papers?
Cryptocurrencies have published white papers during
initial coin offerings (ICOs)
to entice users and investors. Bitcoin launched a few months after the pseudonymous Satoshi
Nakamoto issued its famous white paper
online in October 2008.
2
Why Is It Called a White Paper?
White papers may have developed from the use of “Blue Papers” in 19th-century Britain, where a Parliament report cover was blue. When a topic for the government was less serious, the blue cover was discarded and published with white covers. These reports were called White Papers. In the U.S., government white papers are commonly a background report or guidance.
3
What Topics Might Be Included in a Government White Paper?
Government white papers are written and used by legislators or policymakers to examine a problem and present solutions to elected officials, non-profit organizations,
think tanks
, corporations, and citizens.
4
The Bottom Line
White papers may be several pages long and include information backed by research and statistics from reliable sources. They are commonly written in one of three formats: backgrounders, numbered lists, and problem/solution papers.

A SWOT analysis identifies a company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
What Is a SWOT Analysis?
A SWOT analysis helps define a company's competitive position, assesses internal and external issues, and evaluates its current and future potential. It is a realistic, fact-based, data-driven analysis of an organization.
Key Takeaways
A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique.
It evaluates information from all sources that may have uncontrollable impacts on a company's decisions.
A SWOT analysis works when diverse groups within an organization provide realistic data points rather than prescribed messaging.
Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu
Understanding SWOT Analyses
A SWOT analysis is a technique for assessing the performance, competition, risk, and potential of a business, as well as a part of a business, such as a product line or division, an industry, or other entity.
Using internal and external data, the technique can guide businesses toward strategies more likely to be successful, and away from those in which they have been (or are likely to be) less successful. Independent SWOT analysts, investors, or competitors can also guide them on whether a company, product line, or industry might be strong or weak and why.
Important
The SWOT analysis was first used to analyze businesses. Now, it's often used by governments, nonprofits, and individuals, including investors and entrepreneurs. There are seemingly limitless applications to the SWOT analysis.
Components of SWOT Analysis
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Every SWOT analysis includes four categories. Though the elements and discoveries within these categories will vary from company to company, a SWOT analysis is not complete without each of the following elements.
Strengths:
Strengths describe what an organization excels at and what separates it from the competition: a strong brand, loyal customer base, a strong
balance sheet
, unique technology, and so on. For example, a hedge fund may have developed a proprietary trading strategy that returns market-beating results. It must then decide how to use those results to attract new investors.
Weaknesses:
Weaknesses stop an organization from performing at its optimum level. These are areas where the business needs to improve to remain competitive: a weak brand, higher-than-average turnover, high levels of debt, an inadequate supply chain, or lack of capital.
Opportunities:
Opportunities are favorable external factors that could give an organization a competitive advantage. For example, if a country cuts tariffs, a car manufacturer can export its cars into a new market, increasing sales and market share.
Threats:
Threats
refer to factors that can potentially harm an organization. For example, a drought is a threat to a wheat-producing company, as it may destroy or reduce the crop yield. Other common threats include things like rising costs for materials, increasing competition, tight labor supply, and so on.

SWOT Table
Analysts present a SWOT analysis as a square segmented into four quadrants, each dedicated to an element of SWOT. This visual arrangement provides a quick overview of the company’s position. Although all the points under a particular heading may not be of equal importance, they all should represent key insights into the balance of opportunities and threats, advantages and disadvantages, and so forth.
The SWOT table is often laid out with the internal factors on the top row and the external factors on the bottom row. In addition, the items on the left side of the table are more positive/favorable aspects, while the items on the right are more concerning/negative elements.
How to Do a SWOT Analysis
A SWOT analysis can be broken into several steps with actionable items before and after analyzing the four components. A SWOT analysis generally involves the following steps.
Step 1: Determine Your Objective
A SWOT analysis can be broad, though more value will likely be generated if the analysis is pointed directly at an objective. For example, the objective of a SWOT analysis may be focused only on whether or not to perform a new product
rollout
.
With an objective in mind, a company will have guidance on what it hopes to achieve at the end of the process. In this example, the SWOT analysis should help determine whether or not the product should be introduced.
Step 2: Gather Resources
Every SWOT analysis varies and a company may need different data sets to support pulling together different SWOT analysis tables. A company should begin by understanding what information it has access to, what data limitations it faces, and how reliable its external data sources are.
A company must also have the right combination of personnel involved in the analysis. Some staff may be more connected with external forces, while others within the
manufacturing
or sales departments may have a better grasp of what is going on internally. Having a broad set of perspectives is also more likely to yield diverse, value-adding contributions.
Step 3: Compile Ideas
The group of people assigned to perform the analysis should begin listing ideas within each category. Examples of questions to ask or consider for each group are in the table below.
Internal factors serve as a great source of information for the strengths and weaknesses categories of the SWOT analysis. Examples include financial and
human resources
, tangible and intangible (brand name) assets, and operational efficiencies.
Potential questions to list internal factors are:
(Strength) What are we doing well?
(Strength) What is our strongest asset?
(Weakness) What are our detractors?
(Weakness) What are our lowest-performing product lines?
External factors are equally important to a company's success as internal factors. Influences like
monetary policies
, market changes, and access to suppliers are categories to pull from to create a list of opportunities and weaknesses.
1
Potential questions to list external factors are:
(Opportunity) What trends are evident in the marketplace?
(Opportunity) What demographics are we not targeting?
(Threat) How many competitors exist, and what is their market share?
(Threat) Are there new regulations that potentially could harm our operations or products?
Strengths
1. What is our competitive advantage?
2. What resources do we have?
3. What products are performing well?
Weaknesses
1. Where can we improve?
2. What products are underperforming?
3. Where are we lacking resources?
Opportunities
1. What new technology can we use?
2. Can we expand our operations?
3. What new segments can we test?
Threats
1. What regulations are changing?
2. What are competitors doing?
3. How are consumer trends changing?
Companies may consider performing this step as a white boarding or sticky note session. The idea is there is no right or wrong answer; all participants should be encouraged to share whatever thoughts they have. These ideas can later be discarded; in the meantime, the goal should be to come up with as many items as possible to invoke creativity and inspiration in others.
Step 4: Refine Findings
Clean up the ideas. By refining the thoughts that everyone had, a company can focus on only the best ideas or the largest risks to the company. This stage may require substantial debate among analysis participants, including bringing in
upper management
to help rank priorities.
Step 5: Develop the Strategy
Convert the SWOT analysis into a strategic plan. Members of the analysis team take the bulleted list of items within each category and create a synthesized plan that guides the original objective.
For example, the company debating whether to release a new product may have identified that it is the market leader for its existing product, and there is an opportunity to expand to new markets. However, increased material costs, strained distribution lines, the need for additional staff, and unpredictable product demand may outweigh the strengths and opportunities.
The analysis team develops the strategy to revisit the decision in six months, in hopes that costs decline and market demand becomes more transparent.

Yield to worst represents the lowest yield a bondholder might receive if the bond is redeemed before maturity while still complying to agreement terms.
What Is Yield to Worst (YTW)?
Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible
yield
that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract. It is a type of yield that is referenced when a bond has provisions that would allow the issuer to close it out before it matures. YTW helps investors manage risks and ensure that specific income requirements will still be met even in the worst scenarios.
Key Takeaways
Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond with an early retirement provision.
It assumes the bond is paid off at the earliest date allowed by its terms, such as through a call or early redemption.
Yield to worst is often the same as yield to call.
Yield to worst must always be less than yield to maturity because it represents a return for a shortened investment period.
The opposite of Yield to Worst is Yield to Best, which represents the highest possible yield an investor could receive from a bond.
Investopedia / Eliana Rodgers
Understanding Yield to Worst (YTW)
A
bond's
YTW is calculated based on the earliest call or retirement date. It is assumed that a prepayment of principal occurs if a bond issuer uses the call option. After the call, principal is usually returned and coupon payments are stopped. An issuer will likely exercise their callable option if yields are falling and the issuer can obtain a lower
coupon rate
through new issuance in the current market environment.
The YTW may also be known as the
yield to call (YTC)
. In order to identify the YTW, yield to call and yield to maturity should both be calculated. In general, YTW may be the same as yield to maturity, but it can never be higher since it represents yield for the investor at an earlier prepayment date than the full maturity. YTW is the lowest possible return an investor can achieve from holding a particular bond that fully operates within its contract without defaulting.
1
YTW is not associated with defaults, which are different scenarios altogether.
The Mechanics
The yield to call is an annual rate of return, assuming a bond is redeemed by the issuer at the earliest allowable callable date. A bond is callable if the issuer has the right to redeem it prior to the maturity date. YTW is the lower of the yield to call or yield to maturity.
2
A
put provision
gives the investor the right to sell the bond back to the company at a certain price at a specified date. There is a yield to put, but this doesn't factor into the YTW because it is the investor's option on whether to sell the bond. Bond investors will also review similar-duration securities'
spread-to-worst (STW)
values. STW calculates the difference between the YTW of a bond and a U.S. Treasury security.
The equation for calculating YTC is the following:

YTC
= (coupon interest payment + (call price - market value) ÷ number of years until call) ÷ (( call price + market value ) ÷ 2 )
Analyzing Yields
Yields are typically always reported in annual terms. If a bond is not
callable
, the yield to maturity is the most important and appropriate yield for investors to use because there is no yield to call.
Yield to maturity
is calculated from the following equation:

If a bond is callable, it becomes important to look at the YTW. The
yield to maturity will always be higher than the YTW
because the investor earns more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important though because it provides deeper due diligence on a bond with a
call provision
. The shorter time frame a bond is held for, the less the investor earns. YTW provides a clear calculation of this potential scenario showing the lowest yield possible.
Some
other types of yield
that an investor might also want to consider include: running yield and nominal yield.

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical indicator that calculates a security's average price for the day, weighted by trading volume, to analyze price trends and liquidity.
What Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)?
The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical analysis indicator used on intraday charts that resets at the start of every new trading session. It's the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.
VWAP is important because it provides traders with insight into both the price trend and value of a security.
Key Takeaways
The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) appears as a single line on intraday charts.
It looks similar to a moving average line, but is smoother.
VWAP represents a view of price action throughout a single day's trading session.
Retail and professional traders may use the VWAP to help them determine intraday price trends.
VWAP is a trading
benchmark
that typically is most useful to short-term traders.
Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou
Understanding the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
VWAP is calculated by totaling the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the
volume
) and then dividing by the total shares traded. This can be described in a formula such as the following:
VWAP = (Sum of (Tick Price ×Tick Volume)) / Trading Volume
However, not all traders have a data source that gives them this level of information. Traders and chart vendors often use a substitute formula designed to get close to VWAP.

​
How to Calculate VWAP
By adding the VWAP indicator to a streaming chart, the calculation will be made automatically. However, to calculate the VWAP yourself, follow the steps below.
Assume a five-minute chart. The calculation is the same regardless of what intraday time frame is used.
Find the average price the stock traded at over the first five-minute period of the day. To do this, add the
high, low, and close, then divide by three
. Multiply this by the volume for that period. Record the result in a spreadsheet, under column PV (price, volume).
Divide PV by the volume for that period. This will produce the VWAP.
To maintain the VWAP throughout the day, continue to add the PV value from each period to the prior values. Divide this total by the total volume up to that point.
To make Step 3 easier in a spreadsheet, create columns for cumulative PV and cumulative volume and apply the formula to these figures.
TradingView.
How Is VWAP Used?
VWAP is used in different ways by traders. Traders may use it as
a trend confirmation tool
and build trading rules around it. For instance, they may consider stocks with prices below VWAP as undervalued and those with prices above it as overvalued. If prices below VWAP move above it, traders may
go long
on the stock. If prices above VWAP move below it, they may sell their positions or initiate
short positions
.
Institutional buyers (including mutual funds) use VWAP to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when they can, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP or sell above it. This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.
Note
VWAP's incorporation of volume is valuable to traders for what it can indicate about the degree of trading activity during short periods of time—whether the competition is taking or exiting positions.
VWAP vs. Simple Moving Average
On a chart, VWAP and a
simple moving average (SMA)
may look similar. However, these two indicators are calculated differently and represent different results.
VWAP is calculated by multiplying the typical price by volume and then dividing by total volume.
A simple moving average incorporates price but not volume. The SMA is calculated by totaling
closing prices
over a certain period (say, 10 days) and then dividing the total by the number of periods (e.g., 10).
Limitations of VWAP
1.
VWAP is a single-day indicator and restarts at the opening of each new trading day. Attempting to create an average VWAP over many days could distort it and result in an incorrect indicator.
2.
While some institutions may prefer to buy when the price of a security is below the VWAP or sell when it is above, VWAP is not the only factor to consider.
In strong uptrends, the price may continue to move higher for many days without dropping below the VWAP at all or only occasionally. Therefore, waiting for the price to fall below VWAP could mean a missed opportunity if prices are rising quickly.
3.
VWAP is based on historical values and does not inherently have predictive qualities or calculations. VWAP is anchored to the opening price range of the day. Therefore, the indicator increases its lag as the day goes on.
This can be seen in the way a one-minute period VWAP calculation after 330 minutes (the length of a typical trading session) will often resemble a 390-minute moving average at the end of the trading day.
What Does the VWAP Tell You?
The VWAP can inform traders about a stock's liquidity and indicate at what price buyers and sellers agree. Traders can use it to monitor a stock's price movement throughout the day.
Why Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price Important?
VWAP gives traders a smoothed-out indication of a security’s price adjusted for volume, over time. In addition, it is used by institutional traders to ensure that their trades do not move the price of the security they are trying to buy or sell too extremely.
For example, a hedge fund might refrain from submitting a buy order for a price above the security’s VWAP, in order to avoid artificially inflating the price of that security. Likewise, it might avoid submitting orders too far below the VWAP, so that the price is not dragged down by its sale.
Is VWAP a Leading Indicator?
No, VWAP is not a leading indicator. It is a lagging indicator because it uses historical data. No real-time data is used to calculate VWAP. Therefore, it only has specific uses and does not help traders who need up-to-the-minute data.
The Bottom Line
VWAP is a technical analysis indicator used by traders during single trading sessions to determine the average price of a security, which is based on price and volume. It can provide traders with insight about liquidity and price movement during the day.

Investopedia,"Mutually Exclusive: What It Means, With Examples","Close
Definition
Mutually exclusive events or factors cannot coexist in the same place and time.
What Is Mutually Exclusive?
The concept of mutually exclusive events or factors comes from the field of statistics, where it describes two or more things that cannot happen simultaneously. That is, one must supersede the others, like war and peace or making a left turn and a right turn at the same time.
Mutual exclusivity has been extended into the world of business and finance, where it informs the decision-making processes on opportunities to be pursued or dropped.
Key Takeaways
The concept of mutual exclusivity often arises in the business world in the processes of budgeting and dealmaking.
If considering mutually exclusive options, a company weighs the
opportunity cost
, or the benefits that will be lost if another option is chosen.
The
time value of money
(TVM) is also considered when choosing among mutually exclusive choices.
A choice is not mutually exclusive if two or more options can exist simultaneously.
Understanding Mutually Exclusive
Mutually exclusive events cannot happen simultaneously, but should not be considered independent events. Independent events have no impact on the viability of other options. For a basic example, consider the rolling of dice. You cannot roll a five and a three simultaneously on a single die. However, you can roll a five and a three on two dice.
The fact that one die cannot roll two different numbers means the outcome is mutually exclusive. Rolling a five on one and a three on the other means they are not mutually exclusive outcomes.
Opportunity Cost
When faced with a choice between mutually exclusive options, a company must consider the
opportunity cost
, which is what the company would be giving up to pursue each option. The concepts of opportunity cost and mutual exclusivity are inherently linked because each mutually exclusive option requires the sacrifice of whatever profits could have been generated by choosing the alternate option.

The
time value of money
(TVM) and other factors make mutually exclusive analysis a bit more complicated. For a more comprehensive comparison, companies use
net present value
(NPV) and
internal rate of return
(IRR) formulas to mathematically determine which project is most beneficial when choosing between two or more mutually exclusive options.
Example of Mutually Exclusive
The concept of mutual exclusivity is often applied in
capital budgeting
. Companies may have to choose between multiple projects that will add value to the company upon completion. Some of these projects are mutually exclusive.
For example, assume a company has a budget of $50,000 for expansion projects. If available Projects A and B each cost $40,000 and Project C costs only $10,000, then Projects A and B are mutually exclusive. If the company pursues A, it cannot also afford to pursue B and vice versa. Project C may be considered independent. Regardless of which other project is pursued, the company can still afford to pursue C as well. The acceptance of either A or B does not impact the viability of C, and the acceptance of C does not impact the viability of either of the other projects.
Moreover, when looking at opportunity costs, consider the analysis of Projects A and B. Assume that Project A has a potential return of $100,000, while Project B will only return $80,000. Since A and B are mutually exclusive, the opportunity cost of choosing B is equal to the profit of the most lucrative option (in this case, A) minus the profits generated by the selected option (B); that is, $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000. Because option A is the most lucrative option, the opportunity cost of going for option A is $0.
What Is Meant by Mutually Exclusive?
Mutually exclusive means two events that cannot simultaneously occur. For example, in corporate finance, a company might consider spending a certain amount of capital on one of two projects. Because of the cost and available funds, only one project can be spent on, making them mutually exclusive.
What's the Difference Between Mutually Exclusive and Independent?
Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time, while independent events have no influence on each other's occurrence.
What Is an Example of Mutually Exclusive in Everyday Life?
Consider a road. You can choose to go left or right at a fork, but not both.
The Bottom Line
Things that are mutually exclusive are not able to occur simultaneously. In business, this is typically concerning the undertaking of projects or allocating a budget. If two things are not mutually exclusive, it means the existence and occurrence of one does not necessarily mean the other cannot coexist.

Definition
A correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two financial assets or variables.
What Is a Correlation?
A correlation tells you how two financial variables move together. Financial variables can be assets like stock prices, and bond yields or economic indicators like interest rates. The direction in which they move can be either positive (the same direction) or negative (the opposite direction). Correlations can be used in advanced
portfolio management
and range from +1.0 or the perfect positive correlation to -1.0 or the perfect negative correlation. As an investor, correlations can help you make better investment decisions, minimize your risk, and build a diversified portfolio.
Key Takeaways
A correlation tells you how two financial variables move in relation to one another.
Correlations can be positive or negative.
In finance, the correlation can measure the movement of a stock with that of a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500.
Correlation is closely tied to diversification, the concept that certain types of risk can be mitigated by investing in assets that are not correlated.
Statistical tools like correlation play a big role in finance because they help investors analyze financial data.
Investopedia / Sydney Saporito
What Correlation Can Tell You
Correlation shows the strength of a relationship between two variables and is expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient's values range between -1.0 and 1.0.
A perfect
positive correlation
means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. A perfect
negative correlation
means that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.
For example, large-cap mutual funds generally have a high positive correlation to the
Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index
or nearly one. Small-cap stocks tend to have a positive correlation to the S&P, but it's not as high or approximately 0.8.
However,
put option
prices and their underlying stock prices will tend to have a negative correlation. A put option gives the owner the right but not the obligation to sell a specific amount of an
underlying security
at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame.
1
Put option contracts become more profitable when the underlying stock price decreases. In other words, as the stock price increases, the put option prices go down, which is a direct and high-magnitude negative correlation.
How to Calculate Correlation
There are several methods of calculating correlation. The most common method, the Pearson product-moment correlation, is discussed further in this article. The Pearson product-moment correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables. It can be used for any data set that has a finite covariance matrix. Here are the steps to calculate correlation.
Gather data for your ""x-variable"" and ""y variable.
Find the mean for the x-variable and find the mean for the y-variable.
Subtract the mean of the x-variable from each value of the x-variable. Repeat this step for the y-variable.
Multiply each difference between the x-variable mean and x-variable value by the corresponding difference related to the y-variable.
Square each of these differences and add the results.
Determine the square root of the value obtained in Step 5.
Divide the value in Step 4 by the value obtained in Step 6.
Important
To avoid the complex manual calculation, consider using the CORREL function in Excel.

Example of Correlation
Investment managers, traders, and analysts find it very important to calculate correlation because the
risk reduction benefits of diversification
rely on this statistic. Financial spreadsheets and software can calculate the value of correlation quickly.
As a hypothetical example, assume that an analyst needs to calculate the correlation for the following two data sets:
X:
(41, 19, 23, 40, 55, 57, 33)
Y:
(94, 60, 74, 71, 82, 76, 61)
There are three steps involved in finding the correlation. The first is to add up all the X values to find SUM(X), add up all the Y values to fund SUM(Y) and multiply each X value with its corresponding Y value and sum them to find SUM(X,Y):
SUM(X) = (41 + 19 + 23 + 40 + 55 + 57 + 33) = 268
SUM(Y) = (94 + 60 + 74 + 71 + 82 + 76 + 61) = 518
SUM(X,Y) = (41 x 94) + (19 x 60) + (23 x 74) + ... (33 x 61) = 20,391
The next step is to take each X value, square it, and sum up all these values to find SUM(x^2). The same must be done for the Y values:
SUM(X^2) = (41^2) + (19^2) + (23^2) + ... (33^2) = 11,534
SUM(Y^2) = (94^2) + (60^2) + (74^2) + ... (61^2) = 39,174
Noting that there are seven observations, n, the following formula can be used to find the correlation coefficient, r:

Correlation and Portfolio Diversification
In investing, correlation is most important in relation to a diversified portfolio. Investors who wish to mitigate risk can do so by investing in non-correlated assets. For example, consider an investor who owns airline stock. If the airline industry is found to have a low correlation to the social media industry, the investor may choose to invest in a social media stock understanding that an negative impact to one industry may not impact the other.
This is often the approach when considering investing across asset classes. Stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, cryptocurrency, commodities, and other types of investments each have different relationships to each other. While some may be heavily correlated, others may act as a hedge to diversify risk if they are not correlated.
Fast Fact
Risk that can be diversified away is called unsystematic risk. This type of risk is specific to a company, industry, or asset class. Investing in different assets can reduce your portfolio's correlation and reduce your exposure to unsystematic risk.
Special Considerations
Correlation is often dictated and related to other statistical considerations. It is common to see correlation cited when statistics is used to analyze variables.
P-Value
In statistics, a p-value is used to indicate whether the findings are statistically significant. It is possible to determine that two variables are correlated, but there may not be enough supporting evidence to state this as a strong claim. A high p-value indicates there is enough evidence to meaningfully conclude that the population correlation coefficient is different from zero.
Scatterplots
The easiest way to visualize whether two variables are correlated is to graphically depict them using a scatterplot. Each point on a scatterplot represents one sample item. The x-axis of the scatterplot represents one of the variables being tested, while the y-axis of the scatter plot represents the other.
The correlation coefficient of the two variables is depicted graphically often as a linear line mapped to show the relationship o",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp
Investopedia,What Is Net Profit Margin? Formula and Examples,"Close
Definition
Net profit margin is a metric that includes all factors of a company’s operation and predicts profits based on current revenue.
What Is Net Profit Margin?
Net profit margin (otherwise known as net margin) is a measure of how much profit (or
net income
) a business generates. Most often, the net profit margin is shown as a percentage but it may also be represented by a decimal.
The net profit margin shows how much of each dollar a business earns actually translates into profit. It’s calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its total revenue and multiplying that figure by 100.
We’ll take a deeper dive into the net profit margin formula, including both hypothetical and real examples later in this article.
Key Takeaways
Net profit margin is a true measure of a business’s profit represented as a percentage of its revenue.
Net profit margin is a crucial metric in determining the overall financial standing of a business.
Investors often rely on net profit margin as a key indicator of a company’s financial health and potential for growth.
Tip
Take a look at a company’s net profit margin as a first assessment of its overall value.
How Net Profit Margin Works
Net profit margin is one of the most comprehensive profitability metrics, as it includes all factors of a company’s operation. Carefully tracking fluctuations in net profit margin allows businesses to determine whether their current strategy is effective and accurately predict
profits
based on current revenue.
Since net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage, it’s simple to compare the profitability of two or more companies even if they vary in size and scope.

Net profit margin includes all the below factors in a business's operations:
1
Total
revenue
Cost of goods sold (COGS)
and various additional expenses
Investment income
and any income earned from secondary operations
Any interest expenses incurred on
debt
Corporate tax expenses
Timely payments for unusual events, such as business structuring or legal expenses
A business’s net profit margin is an important metric for investors to determine the profitability of a company and whether or not the business is a good investment. Generally, if a business has a growing revenue, but its operating expenses are increasing, its net profit margin will decrease. Maintaining a strong record of increasing profit margins coupled with shrinking expenses may make a business more attractive to prospective
investors
.
Tip
A company can regularly review costs and pricing strategies to optimize revenue and increase its net profit margin.

​
Where:
Net Income
= Revenue - all costs and expenses (including COGS, operating expenses, taxes, interest, and any other costs).
Total Revenue
= The total sales or revenue generated by the company.
Subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS),
operating expenses
and other expenses,
interest
owed, and any applicable taxes from the total revenue.
Divide that result by total revenue.
Turn that figure into a percentage by multiplying it by 100.
Examples of Net Profit Margin
Here’s a hypothetical example of net profit margin for Company X:
Revenue: $150,000
COGS or cost of goods sold: $30,000
Operating costs: $30,000
Interest: $5,000
Tax liability: $18,000
Net profits: $67,000
In this case, Company X’s net profit margin is 44.6% ($67,000 ÷ $150,000 x 100). A 44.6% profit margin indicates that a business earns around 44 to 45 cents in profit for every dollar it collects.
Here’s a real-world example of net profit margin:
Source: Microsoft
2
Pictured above is the financial statement for Microsoft Corporation for the three months ending Sept. 30, 2024 (left column labeled 2024):
2
Net sales
(total revenue) was $65.6 billion (top section of the chart).
Net income was $24.7 billion for the period (bottom section of the chart).
Microsoft’s net profit margin is calculated by dividing its total net income of $24.7 billion by its net sales (total revenue) of $65.6 billion and multiplying that figure by 100.
So, Microsoft’s net profit margin for the period was 37.7% ($24.7 billion ÷ $65.6 billion × 100).
Net Profit Margin vs. Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin
is how much money is left over from total revenue after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS measures the direct costs associated with the production of goods and services. It may include elements such as labor costs and material costs, and it is deducted from the total revenue to calculate profit.
However, it doesn’t include a company’s
overhead
costs, including employee salaries or advertising expenses, for example. It often appears as a second line item on a company’s income statement, after the sales revenue.
Gross profit margin is calculated by subtracting net sales from the COGS (which equals the gross margin) and dividing that figure by the net sales.
3
Here’s how to calculate the gross profit margin:
It’s represented as a percentage of net income remaining as profit after accounting for the COGS. Unlike net profit margin, gross profit margin helps determine how much profit is generated from a business’s goods and services since it does not include overhead costs whereas net profit margin does.
Pros and Cons of Net Profit Margin
Pros
Cons
May help with understanding whether the current business strategy is working.
Does not focus on sales revenue from a business’s goods and services.
Can be used to effectively measure and compare the profitability between two companies.
Pros and Cons of Gross Profit Margin
Pros
Cons
Can help determine how much profit is generated directly from a business’s goods and services.
Does not include a business’s total overhead costs in its calculation, such as employee salaries or advertising costs.
May help identify areas of improvement in business strategy.
How Does Net Profit Margin Differ From Gross Profit Margin?
Net profit margin includes all expenses like employee salaries, debt payments, and
taxes
whereas gross profit margin identifies how much revenue is directly generated from a business’s goods and services but excludes overhead costs. Net profit margin may be considered a more holistic overview of a company’s profitability.
Why Should Investors Consider a Company’s Net Profit Margin?
Investors should consider a company’s net profit margin because it’s a key indicator of a company’s
profitability
and whether investing in it is a wise decision. If a business shows increasing profits and decreased expenses over time, this may make it more worthwhile and profitable to potential investors.
How Can a Company Positively Impact Its Net Profit Margin?
A company can positively impact its net profit margin by increasing its revenue, whether through price increases or an increased sale volume, while simultaneously eliminating unnecessary expenses and increasing efficiencies.
However, it’s important to recognize that cutting expenses may negatively impact profits if the cuts are too dramatic. For example, if a company
lays off
half its staff to save on salary costs, it may be more difficult to drive company profits with fewer workers. Alternatively, if a company finds cheaper supplies for its materials, perhaps that may result in producing a lower quality product which, in turn, could decrease sales.
The Bottom Line
The net profit margin indicates a business’s profits as a percentage of total revenue. In addition to other measures, the net margin is a key indicator of a company’s profitability and can be used to determine whether a business’s strategy is working or whether changes to increase profitability are needed. For investors, a healthy and stable net profit margin is a positive sign of financial strength and operational efficiency.

Investopedia,Roth IRA: What It Is and How to Open One,"Close
What Is a Roth IRA?
A Roth IRA is a type of tax-advantaged
individual retirement account
to which you can contribute after-tax dollars toward your retirement. Known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS, the primary benefit of a Roth IRA is that your contributions and the earnings on those contributions can grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free after age 59½, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. In other words, you pay taxes on money going into your Roth IRA, and then all future withdrawals are tax-free. The features of a Roth IRA account can vary between providers and you should compare the
best Roth IRA accounts
before making a choice.
Roth IRAs are similar to
traditional IRAs
, with the biggest distinction being how the two are taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Unlike a traditional IRA, the contributions are not tax-deductible, but once you start withdrawing funds, the money you take out is tax-free.
Key Takeaways
A Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement account (IRA) where you pay taxes on money going into your account, and then all future withdrawals of earnings are free from tax and penalty once you reach age 59½ and the Roth IRA has been open for at least five years.
Compared to earnings, you can withdraw contributions tax and penalty-free at any time.
Roth IRAs are best if you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is right now.
Single tax filers cannot contribute to a Roth IRA in 2024 if their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is more than $161,000 ($165,000 in 2025), while for married couples filing jointly, the limit is $240,000 ($246,000 in 2025).
The 2024 and 2025 contribution limit is $7,000, with catch-up contributions of $1,000 allowed for those aged 50 and up.
Most financial institutions, banks, and brokerage ﬁrms, both brick-and-mortar and online, offer a Roth IRA.

How Does a Roth IRA Work?
You can put money you've already paid taxes on into a Roth IRA. When you withdraw earnings once you retire at age 59½ or later and after owning the Roth IRA for five years, you won't have to pay any further taxes. You can withdraw contributions without tax or penalty at any time.
A Roth IRA can be funded from a number of sources:

All
Roth IRA contributions
must be made in cash (which includes checks and money orders) unless they are rollover contributions.

They can’t be in the form of securities or property. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limits how much can be deposited annually in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs. These limits apply across all your IRAs, so even if you have multiple accounts you can't contribute more than the maximum.
Similar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money
invested in a Roth IRA
grows tax-free. However, a Roth IRA is less restrictive than other accounts. The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely. There are no
required minimum distributions (RMDs)
during their lifetime, as there are with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.
Conversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars. You usually
get a tax deduction on your contribution
and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.
Allowable Investments in a Roth IRA
Once you have contributed money to a Roth IRA, you can put it to work by investing in a variety of securities, including
mutual funds
, stocks, bonds,
exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market funds.
Prohibited investments
include life insurance, collectibles, coins (except certain coins minted by the U.S. Treasury), and S-corp stock. “There is no rule against investing your IRA in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency,"" Ed Slott, founder of IRAHelp.com, told Investopedia.
If you want the broadest range of investment options, you need to open a Roth
self-directed IRA (SDIRA)
, a special category of Roth IRA in which the investor, not the financial institution, manages their investments. These unlock a universe of possible investments, including directly investing in digital assets.
“Roth IRAs that can hold cryptocurrency, as well as other unusual assets, are typically available through certain self-directed IRA custodians,"" said Eric Satz, founder and chief executive of Alto, a self-directed IRA platform that provides access to alternative assets. Those specialized self-directed custodians are equipped to manage the unique custody and compliance requirements associated with cryptocurrency investments and provide access to the 24x7 liquidity markets as expected by most crypto investors.”
In addition to the standard investments (stocks, bonds, cash,
money market funds
, and mutual funds), you can hold assets that aren’t typically part of a retirement portfolio in such self-directed Roth IRAs. Some of these include gold, investment real estate, partnerships, and tax liens—even a franchise business.
But just because you’re allowed to invest in cryptocurrency does not make it a good idea. In a traditional IRA, cryptocurrency can generate distributions that get taxed a short-term ordinary income, Slott said. That entails a higher tax rate than long-term capital gains.
Equally bad, if the IRA owner is under age 59½, an additional 10% early distribution penalty can apply, Slott said.
“Crypto makes more sense in a Roth IRA,"" Slott said. ""With Roth IRAs, if the holding rules are followed, any earnings can be distributed tax-free. If a crypto investment appreciates significantly, that could be a substantial tax-free windfall for a Roth IRA owner’s golden years.
“Nevertheless, there are serious concerns that must be addressed when it comes to investing an IRA in crypto. First, IRA owners cannot contribute crypto to an IRA. They must contribute cash. Then the crypto would be purchased within the IRA. Additionally, investments in cryptocurrency face the same issues that other alternative IRA investments encounter. Most IRA custodians will limit available investment choices to firm-approved stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs.”
So your IRA custodian—the Fidelitys and Vanguards of the investment world—could bar digital assets from your Roth or traditional IRA.

Opening a Roth IRA
A
Roth IRA must be established with an institution
that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. These include banks,
brokerage companies
, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations. Generally, individuals open IRAs with brokers.
A
Roth IRA can be established
anytime. However,
contributions for a tax year
must be made by the IRA owner’s tax-filing deadline, which is normally April 15 of the following year.
Two basic documents must be provided to the IRA owner when an IRA is established:
IRA disclosure statement
IRA adoption agreement and plan document
These provide an explanation of the rules and regulations under which the Roth IRA must operate, and they establish an agreement between the IRA owner and the IRA custodian/trustee
.
Not all financial institutions are created equal. Some IRA providers have an expansive list of investment options, while others are more restrictive. Almost
every institution has a different fee structure
for Roth IRAs, which can have a
significant impact on investment returns
.
Your risk tolerance and investment preferences will play a role in choosing a
Roth IRA provider
. If you plan on being an active investor and making lots of trades, you want to find a provider that has lower trading costs
.
On the other hand, certain providers charge you an account inactivity fee if you leave your investments alone for too long. Some providers have more
diverse stock or ETF offerings
than others; it all depends on what type of investments you want in your account.
Pay attention to the specific account requirements as well. Some providers have higher minimum account balances than others. If you plan on banking with the same institution, see if your Roth IRA account comes with additional banking products. If you’re looking at
opening a Roth IRA
at a bank or brokerage where you already have an account, see whether existing customers receive any IRA fee discounts.
Most IRA providers offer only regular IRA (traditional or Roth) accounts. For a self-directed IRA, you’ll need a qualified self-directed IRA custodian who specializes in that type of account, which allows assets beyond the typical stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.

Investopedia,Income: What It Means and How It's Taxed With Examples,"Close
Definition
Income is almost anything you receive in exchange for sales or services and most of it is taxable but there are a few exceptions.
What Is Income?
The term income refers to any type of compensation or benefit received in exchange for work performed or for capital invested. Income can come in the form of the money you receive from your employer or the payments you receive on your investments. Income can be divided into several categories, including gross versus net income and earned versus unearned income.
Key Takeaways
Income is a form of compensation or benefits received for work performed or from investments.
Money earned from an employer and dividends/interest are all forms of income.
Gross income is money received before deductions while net income is take-home pay after all deductions.
Earned income is money you work for while unearned income is a form of passive income, such as investment income.
Federal governments and some states in the U.S. tax income at different rates.
How Income Works
Income is any compensation you receive in exchange for performing services, selling goods, or investing your money. Compensation is usually in the form of money, but it can also come in other forms. The paycheck you receive from your employer is considered income. Dividends and interest from your investments are also considered a form of income.
Federal and most state governments want to collect a percentage of these transactions and they do so in the form of taxation. According to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
, income is ""money, property, goods or services."" It indicates that most income is taxable even if you don't use it right away or if it's paid to someone else on your behalf.
1
Most people think of their weekly, biweekly, or monthly paychecks when they hear the word income but it can go beyond that. Income includes distributions from investments and retirement plans, and even that bottle of wine you might have accepted for walking your neighbor's dog for them. In most cases, you must report it to the IRS and pay taxes on it.
Types of Income
Gross Income vs. Net Income
Your employer may pay you a salary of $2,000 weekly but it's highly unlikely that they'll hand you a paycheck in that amount. They'll make several deductions from this amount for taxes and other obligations such as contributions you might make to a retirement plan or insurance premiums.
The initial amount before deductions is your gross income. What remains after deductions are made is referred to as your net income.
Unearned Income vs. Earned Income
Unearned income
is typically derived from investments. As the name implies, it is money you didn't work for, although you may have worked for the dollars you invested. This includes
dividends
, taxable interest, capital gains, and retirement plan distributions. It also includes benefits such as the taxable portion of any Social Security you might collect or unemployment compensation.
Earned income
is paid to you in exchange for working or performing a service. You're required to complete and submit a Form W-4 when you begin a new job, detailing personal factors like your marital status and how many dependents you have. This information affects how much your employer will withhold in the way of income taxes and send to the government on your behalf.
Ordinary Income vs. Capital Gains
Earned and unearned income fall into the category of ordinary income.
Capital gains
are income received from the sale of capital assets such as real estate or stocks.
Assume you purchased a parcel of land years ago for $100,000. It's since appreciated in value and you sell it for $200,000. You've realized a $100,000 capital gain and you must pay tax on that gain but not at the same rate that applies to your ordinary income. Some capital gains have their own tax rates and they can be much kinder than ordinary income tax rates depending on your overall income. The rates increase as your income increases.
Most capital gains are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% but some exceptions exist for items like collectibles and qualified small business stock. These are taxed at a rate of 28% as of 2025. You can subtract
capital losses
from this type of income as well if you lose money on an investment subject to more rules.
2
Compare this to ordinary income tax rates ranging from 10% to 37% as of 2025.
3
Capital gains tax rates apply only if you own the asset in question for more than one year before you sell it. You must pay tax at your ordinary income tax rate if you own the asset for one year or less. The difference can be that one single day that exceeds a year.
2
How Income Is Taxed
Several types of income are categorized in the
Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
and each can be subject to its own tax terms, obligations, and rules. In the United States, the payor and the recipient must report their income by filing
W-2 forms
and various
1099 forms
with the IRS as well as to the recipient's state government if applicable.
Working outside the U.S. won't spare you even if you also live outside the U.S. but you're an American citizen. You must file a tax return and pay taxes on the income you receive.
4
The IRC allows you to
exclude some foreign income
—up to $130,000 as of 2025. You can exclude $126,500 for tax year 2024.
3
Important
Not all states impose a tax on income, however. Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming don't. New Hampshire taxes only dividend and interest income and Washington taxes only capital gains. The recipient must then pay taxes on the income.
5
FICA
Social Security tax is withheld from your gross income at the rate of 6.2% of earnings up to $176,100 a year as of 2025. Your employer must match that by contributing an additional 6.2%. The same arrangement works with Medicare but the rate is 1.45% each for you and your employer.
6
Self-employed individuals
must pay both halves because the government takes the position that they're both employee and employee. They're obligated to make payments voluntarily every quarter.
7
Some taxpayers whose
modified adjusted gross incomes (MAGIs)
after claiming tax deductions and credits exceed certain thresholds must also pay a
net investment income
tax at a rate of 3.8%. The MAGI thresholds range from $125,000 to $250,000 depending on your filing status. You can pay the percentage on your net investment income if it's less, however.
8
Gift and Estate Taxes
The monetary value of gifts is typically taxable but the federal
gift tax
is paid by the donor—not the recipient. Connecticut is the only state that imposes this type of tax at the state level.
9
An
estate tax
is imposed when property or money owned by an individual is transferred to living beneficiaries after the individual's death. The federal government allows estates to transfer up to $13.99 million in money and property to beneficiaries without taxation as of 2025, however.
10
Only 12 states and the District of Columbia impose an estate tax at the state level.
11
Tax Breaks on Ordinary Income
The IRS isn't as heartless as most people believe. The IRC is laden with
tax deductions and tax credits
you can claim to reduce either your taxable income or the amount of tax you owe.
Tax credits
subtract directly from the tax you owe and some are even refundable. The IRS will send you the money if any is left over after erasing your tax obligation.
12
Tax deductions
are amounts you can subtract from your income. You're obligated to pay tax on only the balance that remains. The standard deduction is an example. It's based on your filing status and ranges from $15,000 to $30,000 in tax year 2025.
3
Your other option is to itemize your deductions, subtracting expenses you've paid all year, such as mortgage interest, state and local income taxes,
property taxes
, or donations to qualifying charities. You can't do both, however. Itemizing or claiming the standard deduction is an either/or decision.
13
The Bottom Line
Income is virtually anything you receive from working, investing, or selling property. The more income you have, the more you'll pay in taxes, at least in the United States. And it's not just about taxes. Your income determines your standard of living and quality of life.

Investopedia,"Uniform Distribution: Definition, How It Works, and Examples","Close
Definition
A uniform distribution is a probability distribution where each outcome in a range has an equal chance of occurring.
What Is a Uniform Distribution?
In
statistics
, probability distributions can help you decide the probability of a future event—that is, the likelihood of something happening. A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution where the probability remains constant across the entire range of possible values (i.e., all outcomes are equally likely).
A deck of cards is expected to have a uniform distribution because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution expectation because the odds of getting either heads or tails are the same.
A uniform distribution can be visualized as a straight horizontal line. For a coin flip, heads or tails each has a probability of occurring 50% of the time (p = 0.50), so it would be plotted on a chart with a line from the y-axis at 0.50.
Key Takeaways
In a uniform distribution, all possible outcomes are equally probable.
In a discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have the same likelihood.
In a continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite.
In a normal distribution, data around the mean (average) occur more frequently than occurrences farther from it.
Uniform distributions can be plotted on charts.
Understanding Uniform Distributions
There are two types of uniform distributions:
discrete
and continuous.
Discrete Uniform Distributions
The possible results of rolling a die provide an example of a discrete uniform distribution. It is possible to roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but it is not possible to roll, for example, a 2.3, 4.7, or 5.5. Therefore, the roll of a die generates a discrete distribution with the probability of 1/6 for each outcome. There are only six possible values to return and nothing in between. The possibilities are finite.
Fast Fact
The term “discrete” in statistics refers to variables with singular, countable, and limited possible values.
Continuous Uniform Distributions
Continuous uniform distributions have infinite distribution possibilities. An idealized random number generator would be considered a continuous uniform distribution. With this type of distribution, every point in the continuous range between 0.0 and 1.0 has an equal opportunity of appearing, yet there is an infinite number of points between 0.0 and 1.0.
There are several other important continuous distributions, such as the
normal distribution
,
chi-square
, and Student’s
t-distribution
.
Distribution Analysis
There are also several data-generating or data-analyzing functions associated with distributions that help explain the variables and their
variance
within a dataset. These functions include
probability density function
, cumulative density, and moment generating functions.
Visualizing Uniform Distributions
A distribution is a simple way to visualize a dataset. It can be shown either as a graph or a list, and reveals which values of a random variable have lower or higher chances of happening.
In a uniform distribution, each value in the set of possible values has the same possibility of happening. When displayed as a
bar
or
line graph
, this distribution has the same height for each potential outcome. In this way, it can look like a
rectangle
and therefore is sometimes described as the rectangular distribution.
If you think about the possibility of drawing a particular suit from a deck of playing cards, there is a random yet equal chance of pulling a heart as there is for pulling a spade—that is, ¼ or 25%. (There are four suits.)
The roll of a die yields one of six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Because there are only 6 possible outcomes, the probability of you landing on any one of them is 16.67% (1/6). When plotted on a graph, the distribution is represented as a horizontal line, with each possible outcome captured on the x-axis, at the fixed point of probability along the y-axis.

Example of a Uniform Distribution
There are 52 cards in a traditional deck of cards. Also in that deck are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains an ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, jack, queen, and a king. The deck contains two jokers as well. However, we’ll ignore the jokers and face cards for this example, and focus only on number cards replicated in each suit. As a result, we are left with 40 cards, a set of discrete data.
Suppose you want to know the probability of pulling a two of hearts from the modified deck. The probability of pulling a two of hearts is 1/40 or 2.5%. Each card is unique. Therefore, the likelihood that you will pull any one of the cards in the deck is the same.
Now, let’s consider the likelihood of pulling a heart from the deck. The probability is significantly higher. Why? We are now only concerned with the suits in the deck. Since there are four suits and each suit has the same number of cards, pulling a heart yields a probability of ¼ or 25%.
Uniform Distribution vs. Normal Distribution
Some of the most common probability distributions are:
Discrete uniform
Binomial
Continuous uniform
Normal
Exponential
Normal
One of the most widely used distributions is the
normal distribution
, which is often depicted as a
bell curve
. Normal distributions show how continuous data is distributed and depict most of the data as concentrated on the
mean
(average).
In a normal distribution, the area under the curve equals one. 68.27% of all data falls within one standard deviation (how dispersed the numbers are) from the mean. 95.45% of all data falls within two standard deviations from the mean, and approximately 99.73% of all data falls within three standard deviations from the mean.
1
As the data points move away from the mean, the frequency of data occurring decreases.
Uniform
Discrete uniform distribution shows that variables in a range have the same probability of occurring. There are no variations in probable outcomes, and the data is discrete, rather than continuous. Its shape resembles a rectangle, rather than the normal distribution’s bell. Like a normal distribution, however, the area under the graph is equal to one.
Explain Like I’m 5 Years Old
With a uniform distribution, you’re just as likely to get one outcome as another. Take a die with six sides, for example. You’re just as likely to roll a 1 as you are to roll a 2 (or 3, 4, 5, or 6).
What Is the Formula for a Uniform Distribution?
The formula for a discrete uniform distribution is
P
x
=
1
n
where:
P
x
=
Probability of a discrete value
n
=
Number of values in the range
\begin{aligned}&P_x = \frac{ 1 }{ n } \\&\textbf{where:} \\&P_x = \text{Probability of a discrete value} \\&n = \text{Number of values in the range} \\\end{aligned}
​
P
x
​
=
n
1
​
where:
P
x
​
=
Probability of a discrete value
n
=
Number of values in the range
​
Is a Uniform Distribution Normal?
No, a uniform distribution is not normal. Normal, which refers to the way data is distributed about the mean (average), shows that the probability of a variable occurring around the mean is higher than for a variable occurring far away from the mean. The occurrence probability is not uniform with normal data, whereas it is constant with a uniform distribution.
What Is the Expectation of a Uniform Distribution?
The expectation with a uniform distribution is that all possible outcomes have the same probability. The probability for one variable is the same as that for another.
The Bottom Line
A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution that is used in statistics. A uniform, or rectangular, distribution is one where all possible outcomes are finite and equally likely to occur. For example, the roll of a single die presents just six possible results, and each result has a 1/6 chance of taking place.

What Is a Zero-Lot-Line House?
A zero-lot-line house is a piece of residential
real estate
in which the structure comes up to, or very near to, the edge of the property line. Rowhouses, garden homes, patio homes, and townhomes are all types of properties that may be zero-lot-line homes. They may be attached (as in a townhouse) or a detached single story or multistory residence.
key takeaways
A zero-lot-line house is a piece of residential real estate in which the structure comes up to, or very near to, the edge of the property line.
Zero-lot-line houses can be attached or detached, and are especially popular in urban areas.
Noise and proximity to neighbors can be disadvantages to zero-lot-line homes.
Low maintenance and lower prices are advantages of zero-lot-line homes.
Understanding a Zero-Lot-Line House
Zero-lot-line houses are built very close to their boundary lines to create more usable space for the residence. Because there is virtually no space left over they are called ""zero lot."" With a zero-lot-line house, the buyer only has to pay for a lot large enough to hold the house. Such a home confers savings to purchasers who cannot afford a larger lot or do not feel they need one enough to justify the expense.
These homes are especially popular in urban renewal settings. In places with high population density, such as the urban core of a large metropolitan area, zero-lot-line houses impart buyers with options beyond the typical lofts and condos while maintaining the ability to provide housing for large numbers of people in a tightly circumscribed area.
Zero-Lot-Line House Advantages
Though they cost less than homes with lots of extra acreage, zero-lot-line homes are not just for low-income homebuyers; they are an attractive option for anyone who doesn't have the time or inclination to maintain landscaping. Not leaving room in the property plot for a yard allows for maximum square footage in the home. Zero-lot homes offer many of the advantages of actual
houses—without the time-consuming demands of upkeep and the expense of
large backyards or front lawns.
These homes are also an appealing alternative to
condos
because they offer greater privacy and independence while still being low-maintenance. A common complaint in condominium settings is that a homeowner shares walls with as many as five neighbors, increasing the chances of noise disturbances from neighbors and eroding any sense of privacy. While certain zero-lot-line homes, such as townhouses and rowhouses, still include shared walls, there are fewer of them. Other zero-lot-line options, such as garden homes, offer homeowners the freedom of a standalone structure.
Because zero lot developments often incorporate shared spaces into their design—features such as shared back alleys and front porches right at the street—many of these home encourage a real sense of community among neighbors.
Zero-Lot-Line House Disadvantages
Window placement, noise, and a lack of privacy can be issues with these types of homes since there is little to no buffer zone surrounding them. Moreover, because zero-lot-line homes typically feature less setback from the road compared to homes on larger lots, noise from passing cars may be of constant concern, particularly if the home is situated on a busy thoroughfare.
Zero-lot-line houses can create challenges among neighbors, especially in areas where people are used to having larger buffer zones. In traditionally dense neighborhoods where residents are used to living in close quarters, smaller buffer zones are less of a challenge.
Finally, zero-lot-line homes might fetch less on the real estate market, especially in boom times. Lots of land around a home still connote luxury and value, and provide homeowners with flexibility to expand. To some, a zero-lot-line home could represent the worst of all worlds: all the noise and lack of privacy of an apartment, with the upkeep of a free-standing structure, but without compensatory acreage and space.

The 4 Ps of marketing are product, price, place, and promotion which are essential elements for successfully marketing a product or service.
What Are the 4 Ps of Marketing?
The four Ps or marketing are a “marketing mix” comprised of four key elements—product, price, place, and promotion.
These are the key factors that are involved in introducing a product or service to the public. Often referred to as a
marketing mix
, they provide a framework that companies can use to successfully market a product or service to consumers. Since the four Ps were introduced in the 1950s, more Ps have been added to the mix, including people, process, and physical evidence.
Key Takeaways
The four Ps are the four essential factors involved in marketing a product or service to the public.
The four Ps are product, price, place, and promotion.
The concept of the four Ps has been around since the 1950s. As the marketing industry has evolved, other Ps have been identified: people, process, and physical evidence.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding the 4 Ps of Marketing
Neil Borden, an advertising professor at Harvard, popularized the idea of the marketing mix—and the concepts that would later be known primarily as the four Ps—in the 1950s. His 1964 article ""The Concept of the Marketing Mix"" demonstrated the ways that companies could use advertising tactics to engage their consumers.
1
Decades later, the concepts that Borden popularized are still being used by companies to advertise their goods and services.
Borden's ideas were developed and refined over a number of years by other key players in the industry. E. Jerome McCarthy, a marketing professor at Michigan State University, refined the concepts in Borden's article and named them the ""four Ps"" of marketing. McCarthy co-wrote the book
Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach
, further popularizing the idea.

At the time the concept was introduced, it helped companies breach the physical barriers that could hamper widespread product adoption. Today, the Internet has helped businesses to overcome some of these barriers.
People, process, and physical evidence are extensions of the original Four Ps and are relevant to current trends in marketing.
Tip
Any successful marketing strategy should be revisited from time to time. The marketing mix you create is not intended to be static. It needs to be adjusted and refined as your product grows and your
customer base changes
.
1. Product
Creating a marketing campaign starts with an understanding of the product itself. Who needs it and why? What does it do that no competitor's product can do? Perhaps it's a new thing altogether and is so compelling in its design or function that consumers will have to have it when they see it.
The job of the marketer is to define the product and its qualities and introduce it to the consumer—the basic marketing of a product (or service).
Defining the product also is key to its distribution.
Marketers
need to understand the
life cycle of a product
, and business executives need to have a plan for dealing with products at every stage of the life cycle.
The type of product also dictates in part how much it will cost, where it should be placed, and how it should be promoted.
Many of the most successful products have been the first in their category. For example, Apple was the first to create a touchscreen smartphone that could play music, browse the internet, and make phone calls. Apple reported total sales of the iPhone for FY 2022 at $205.4 billion.
3
In 2021, it hit the milestone of two billion iPhones sold.
4
2. Price
Price is the amount that consumers will be willing to pay for a product. Marketers must link the price point to the product's real and perceived value, while also considering supply costs, seasonal discounts, competitors' prices, and retail markup.
In some cases, business decision-makers may raise the price of a product to give it the appearance of luxury or exclusivity. Or, they may lower the price so more consumers will try it.
Marketers also need to determine when and if discounting is appropriate. A discount can draw in more customers, but it can also give the impression that the product is less desirable than it was.
UNIQLO, headquartered in Japan, is a global manufacturer of casual wear. Like its competitors Gap and Zara, UNIQLO creates low-priced, fashion-forward garments for younger buyers.
What makes UNIQLO unique is that its products are innovative and high-quality. It accomplishes this by purchasing fabric in large volumes, continually seeking the highest-quality and lowest-cost materials in the world. The company also directly negotiates with its manufacturers and has built strategic partnerships with innovative Japanese manufacturers.
UNIQLO also outsources its production to partner factories. That gives it the flexibility to change production partners as its needs change.
Finally, the company employs a team of skilled textile artisans that it sends to its partner factories all over the world for quality control. Production managers visit factories once a week to resolve quality problems.
5
3. Place
Place is the consideration of where the product should be available—in brick-and-mortar stores and online—and how it will be displayed.
The decision is key: The makers of a luxury cosmetic product would want to be displayed in Sephora and Neiman Marcus, not in Walmart or Family Dollar. The goal of business executives is always to get their products in front of the consumers who are the most likely to buy them.
That means placing a product only in certain stores and getting it displayed to the best advantage.
The term placement also refers to advertising the product in the right media to get the attention of its target audience of consumers.
For example, the 1995 movie
GoldenEye
was the 17th installment in the James Bond movie franchise and the first that did not feature an Aston Martin car. Instead, Bond actor Pierce Brosnan got into a BMW Z3. Although the Z3 was not released until months after the film had left theaters, BMW received 9,000 orders for the car the month after the movie opened.
4. Promotion
The goal of promotion is to communicate to consumers that they need this product and that it is priced appropriately. Promotion encompasses advertising, public relations, and the overall media strategy for introducing a product.
Marketers tend to tie together promotion and placement elements to reach their core audiences. For example, in the digital age, the ""place"" and ""promotion"" factors are as much online as offline. Specifically, that means where a product appears on a company's web page or social media, as well as which types of search functions will trigger targeted ads for the product.
The Swedish vodka brand Absolut sold only 10,000 cases of its vodka in 1980. By 2000, the company had sold 4.5 million cases, thanks in part to its iconic advertising campaign. The images in the campaign featured the brand's signature bottle styled as a range of surreal images: a bottle with a halo, a bottle made of stone, or a bottle in the shape of the trees standing on a ski slope. To date, the Absolut campaign is one of the longest-running continuous campaigns of all time, from 1981 to 2005.

How to Use the 4 Ps of Marketing in Your Marketing Strategy
The four Ps provide a framework on which to build your marketing strategy. Think through each factor. And don't worry when the factors overlap. That's inevitable.
First, analyze the product you will be marketing. What are the characteristics that make it appealing? Consider similar products that are already on the market. Your product may be tougher, easier to use, more attractive, or longer-lasting. Its ingredients might be environmentally friendly or naturally sourced. Identify the qualities that will make it appealing to your target consumers.
Think through the appropriate price for the product. It's not simply the cost of production plus a profit margin. You may be positioning it as a premium or luxury product or as a bare-bones, lower-priced alternative.
Placement involves identifying the type of store, online and off, that stocks products like yours for consumers like yours.
Your promotion strategies can only be considered in the context of your target consumer. The prod",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-ps.asp

What Is Yield on Earning Assets?
The yield on earning assets is a popular financial
solvency ratio
that compares a financial institution’s
interest income
to its earning assets. Yield on earning assets indicates how well assets are performing by looking at how much income they bring in.
Key Takeaways
Yield on earning assets is a financial solvency ratio that compares an entity's interest income to its earning assets.
It is a measure of how much income assets are bringing in to the firm.
A higher yield on earning assets is preferred and indicates that a company is using its assets efficiently.
A high yield on earning assets also indicates that an entity is able to meet its short-term debt obligations and is not at risk of default or insolvency.
Banks have to strike a balance between the number of loans offered, the rates charged, and the duration of the loans when compared to assets to achieve the right ratio levels.
Increasing a low yield on earning assets would require a restructuring of an entity's pricing policy, approach to risk management, and investment strategy.
Understanding Yield on Earning Assets
Solvency ratios shed light on if a financial institution has the ability to stay in business by meeting its short-term obligations. The
yield
on earning assets is a way for regulators to determine how much money a financial institution is earning on its assets. Large cash yields are preferred, thereby indicating that a company can pay its short-term obligations and is not at risk of default or
insolvency
.
Banks and
financial institutions
that provide loans and other investment options that offer yields have to strike a balance between the different types of investment vehicles they offer, the interest rates charged, and the duration of those investments. These factors determine the amount of interest income a debt vehicle will bring in over a specific time frame. This interest income is then compared to the earning assets.
Generally speaking, the higher a company’s
loan
to asset ratio, the higher its yield on returning assets. This is because the more loans made the more interest income earned or because higher-yielding
investment vehicles
bring in more income relative to the amount of money loaned out.
High Yield vs. Low Yield
High yield on earning assets is an indicator that a company is bringing in a large amount of income from the loans and investments that it makes. This is often the result of good policies, such as ensuring that loans are appropriately priced, and investments are properly managed, as well as the company’s ability to garner a larger
share of the market
.
Financial institutions with a low yield on earning assets are at an increased risk of insolvency, which is the reason the yield on earning assets is of interest to regulators. A low ratio means that a company is providing loans that do not perform well since the amount of interest from those loans is approaching the value of the earning assets.
Regulators may take this as an indicator that a company’s policies are creating a scenario in which the company will not be able to cover losses, and could thus become insolvent.
As a measure of effectiveness, yield on earning assets can be useful for comparing different managers relative to their asset bases. Managers, or entire businesses, that can generate sizable yield with a small asset base are considered to be more efficient, and likely offer more value.
Increasing a Low Yield on Earning Assets
Increasing a low yield on earning assets often involves a review and
restructuring
of a company’s policies and approach to
risk management
, as well as a review of the general operations of how the company chooses which loans to provide to which markets.
Depending on the business or strategy, at times, yield on earning assets may need to be adjusted for various methods when compiling financial statements. For instance, certain
off-balance
sheet items could distort reported yield on assets when using financial statements that have not been adjusted to reflect these off-balance sheet items.
Furthermore, financial institutions could be charging low
interest rates
to remain competitive and gain business, which would result in a lower amount of income earned. In this case, a review of a company's pricing policy would be necessary.

The S&P 500 is a stock market index weighted by market capitalization that is made up of 500 of the largest public companies in the United States.
What Is the S&P 500 Index?
The S&P 500 Index is a list of 500 of the largest public companies in the U.S. These companies are the biggest and most important companies in the country, and represent a broad cross-section of the economy. It is managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a subsidiary of S&P Global. The index, which is weighted by market capitalization, is considered to be one of the best gauges of U.S. equities, the stock market, and the American economy. The index actually includes 503 components because three companies have two share classes listed.
1
Key Takeaways
The S&P 500 Index features 500 leading U.S. publicly traded companies with a primary emphasis on market capitalization.
The S&P 500 Index was launched in 1957 by the credit rating agency Standard and Poor's.
The S&P is a float-weighted index, which means the market caps of its components are adjusted by the number of tradable shares.
The index is considered a bellwether of the U.S. economy.
You can't invest directly in the S&P 500 because it's an index but you can invest in one of the many funds that use it as a benchmark and track its composition and performance.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Weighting Formula and Calculation of the S&P 500
The S&P 500 uses a
market-cap weighting method
that gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market capitalizations.
2
Company Weighting in S & P
=
Company market cap
Total of all market caps
\text{Company Weighting in S \& P}= \frac{\text{Company market cap}}{\text{Total of all market caps}}
Company Weighting in S & P
=
Total of all market caps
Company market cap
​
Determining the weighting of each component of the S&P 500 begins with calculating the total market cap for the index by adding together the market cap of every company in the index.
The market cap of a company is calculated by taking the current stock price and multiplying it by the company's
outstanding shares
. The total market cap for the S&P 500 as well as the market caps of individual companies are published frequently on financial websites, saving investors the need to calculate them.
The
weighting of each company
in the index is calculated by taking the company's market cap and dividing it by the total market cap of the index.
3
Other S&P Indices
The S&P 500 is a part of the S&P Global 1200 family of indices. Other indices include the
S&P MidCap 400
which represents the mid-cap range of companies and the
S&P SmallCap 600
which represents small-cap companies. The S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600 combine to cover 90% of all U.S. capitalization in an index known as the S&P Composite 1500.

shares, the shares that the public can trade, when calculating market cap. The S&P adjusts each company's market cap to compensate for new share issues or company mergers.
The value of the index is calculated by totaling the adjusted market caps of each company and dividing the result by a divisor. The divisor is proprietary information of the S&P and isn't released to the public. The S&P Index (SPX) isn't a total return index and
doesn't include cash dividend gains
for the companies listed.

You can nonetheless calculate a company's weighting in the index and this can provide investors with valuable information. You can get a sense as to whether it might have an impact on the overall index if a stock rises or falls. A company with a 10% weighting would have a greater impact on the value of the index than a company with a 2% weighting.
The S&P 500 is one of the most widely quoted American indexes because it represents the largest publicly traded corporations in the U.S. It focuses on the U.S. market's large-cap sector and it's also a float-weighted index which is a type of capitalization weighting. Company market caps are adjusted by the number of shares available for public trading.
2
Fast Fact
The S&P 500 was rebalanced on April 23, 2025.
7
In the first months of 2025, several companies have entered and exited the index. Coinbase Global, DoorDash, TKO Group Holdings, Williams-Sonoma, and Expand Energy all joined the index. Conversely, Discover Financial Services, BorgWarner, Teleflex, Celanese, and FMC were removed from the S&P 500.

S&P 500 Competitors
S&P 500 vs. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
Another common U.S. stock market benchmark is the
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
. The S&P 500 is often the institutional investor's preferred index given its depth and breadth. The DJIA has historically been associated with significant equities from the retail investor's point of view. Institutional investors perceive the S&P 500 as being more representative of U.S. equity markets because it includes more stocks across all sectors: 500 versus the Dow's 30.
The S&P 500 uses a market-cap weighting method that gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market caps. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that gives companies with higher stock prices a higher index weighting. The market-cap-weighted structure tends to be more common than the price-weighted index across U.S. indexes.

S&P 500 vs. Nasdaq
Nasdaq
is a global electronic marketplace for trading securities. Several equity market indexes include stocks traded on Nasdaq. A given stock included in the S&P 500 Index may also be in one or more of the various Nasdaq indexes.
Some of the most-watched Nasdaq stock indices include:
Nasdaq 100 Index
:
Includes 100 of the largest, most actively traded common equities listed on the Nasdaq
10
Nasdaq Composite Index
:
Often simply referred to as the Nasdaq by the media includes more than 2,500 common stocks that trade on the Nasdaq
11
Nasdaq Global Equity Index (NQGI):
Includes international stocks
12
PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX)
:
The leading barometer of stocks related to the semiconductor industry

OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30):
Includes the 30 largest and most actively traded stocks on the Stockholm Stock Exchange
14
S&P 500 vs. Russell Indexes
The S&P 500 is a member of a set of indexes created by Standard & Poor's. This set of indexes is like the Russell index family in that both are market-cap-weighted unless stated otherwise as in the case of
equal-weighted
indexes.
There are
two significant differences
between the construction of the S&P and the Russell families of indexes. Standard & Poor's chooses constituent companies via a committee.
Russell indexes
use a formula to select which stocks to include. There's no name overlap within S&P style indices such as growth versus value. Russell indexes will include the same company in both the value and growth style indexes.
15
16
S&P 500 vs. Vanguard 500 Fund
The
Vanguard 500 Index Fund
aims to track the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index by investing its total net assets in the stocks that make up the index and by holding each component with approximately the same weight as the S&P index. The fund barely deviates from the S&P, which it tracks.
17
Important
The S&P 500 is an index so it can't be traded directly. Anyone who wants to invest in the companies that are included in the S&P must invest in a mutual fund or
exchange-traded fund (ETF)
that tracks the index such as the
Vanguard 500 ETF
(
VOO
).
Limitations of the S&P 500 Index
One of the limitations of the S&P and other market-cap-weighted indexes occurs when
stocks in the index
become overvalued. They rise higher than their fundamentals warrant. The stock typically inflates the overall value or price of the index if it has a heavy weighting in the index while being overvalued.
A company's rising market cap isn't necessarily indicative of its fundamentals. It simply reflects the stock's increase in value relative to the shares outstanding. Equal-weighted indexes have become increasingly popular as a result. Each company's stock price movements have an equal impact on these indexes.

Definition
An organizational structure is a system that defines how activities are managed and directed to achieve an organization's goals.
What Is an Organizational Structure?
An organizational structure is a system that guides how certain activities are directed to achieve the goals of an organization. The organizational structure also determines how information flows between levels within the company. Decisions flow from the top down in a centralized structure. Decision-making power is distributed among various levels of the organization in a decentralized structure. Having an organizational structure in place allows companies to remain efficient and focused.
Key Takeaways
An organizational structure maps how certain tasks will lead to certain specific desired outcomes of a company.
Successful organizational structures define each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system.
A centralized structure has a defined chain of command. Decentralized structures give almost every employee a high level of personal agency.
Types of organizational structures include functional, divisional, flatarchy, and matrix structures.
Senior leaders should consider a variety of factors including the business's goals, industry, and culture before deciding which type of organization is best for their businesses.
Understanding an Organizational Structure
Businesses of all shapes and sizes heavily use organizational structures. They define a specific
hierarchy
within an organization. A successful organizational structure defines each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system. The organizational structure lays out who does what so the company can meet its objectives.
This structuring provides a company with a visual representation of how it's shaped and how it can best move forward in achieving its goals. Organizational structures are normally illustrated in some sort of chart or diagram like a pyramid where the most powerful members of the organization sit at the top and those with the least amount of power are at the bottom.
Not having a formal structure in place can prove difficult for certain organizations. Employees may have difficulty knowing to whom they should report. That can lead to uncertainty as to who is responsible for what in the organization.
Having a structure in place can help with
efficiency
and provide clarity for everyone at every level. An effective organizational structure should result in each department within the organization becoming more focused and productive.

Centralized vs. Decentralized Organizational Structures
An organizational structure is either centralized or decentralized. Organizations have traditionally been structured with centralized leadership and a defined chain of command. The military is an organization famous for its highly centralized structure with a long and specific hierarchy of superiors and subordinates. There are very clear responsibilities for each role in a centralized organizational system with subordinate roles defaulting to the guidance of their superiors.
More people play a role in decision-making with a decentralized organizational structure, Mid- and lower-level managers as well as regular employees have more of a say in what goes on and can help call the shots.
There's been a rise in decentralized organizations. This approach is popular among many technology
startups
and is viewed as enabling them to remain fast, agile, and adaptable with everyone able to throw ideas around.
Johnson & Johnson is renowned for its decentralized structure. As a large company with many business units and brands that function in sometimes very different industries, each operates autonomously. Another well-known company that gives employees a high level of personal agency is Spotify.
1
2
Important
Decentralized structures are becoming more common and are popular among tech startups.
Built-in hierarchies usually still exist in decentralized companies such as the chief operating officer operating at a higher level than an entry-level associate. Teams are empowered to make their own decisions and come to the best conclusion without necessarily getting ""approval"" from up top, however.
Types of Organizational Structures
Four types of common organizational structures are typically implemented.
Functional Structure
The first and most common is a functional structure. It's also referred to as a
bureaucratic organizational structure
. It breaks up a company based on the specialization of its workforce.
Most small-to-medium-sized businesses implement a functional structure. Dividing the firm into departments consisting of marketing, sales, and operations uses a bureaucratic organizational structure.
Divisional or Multidivisional Structure
This type is common among large companies with many business units. It's called the divisional or multidivisional (M-Form) structure.
A company that uses this method structures its leadership team based on the products, projects, or subsidiaries it operates. Johnson & Johnson is a good example of this structure. The company has thousands of products and lines of business. It structures itself so each business unit operates as its own company with its own president.
3
Divisions may also be designated geographically in addition to specialization. A global corporation might have a North American Division and a European Division.
Team-Based Structure
Team-based organizations segregate into close-knit teams of employees that serve particular goals and functions, similar to divisional or functional structures. Each team is a unit that contains both leaders and workers, however.
Flat (Flatarchy) Structure
Flatarchy, also known as a horizontal structure, is used among many startups. It flattens the hierarchy and chain of command as the name implies. It gives its employees a great deal of autonomy. Companies that use this type of structure have a high speed of implementation.
Matrix Structure
Firms can also have a matrix structure. This is the most confusing and the least used. It matrixes employees across different superiors, divisions, or departments. An employee working for a matrixed company may have duties in both sales and
customer service
.
Circular Structure
Circular structures are hierarchical but they're said to be circular because they place higher-level employees and managers at the center of the organization with concentric rings expanding outward. They contain lower-level employees and staff. Organizing this way is intended to encourage open communication and collaboration among the ranks.
Network Structure
The network structure organizes contractors and third-party vendors to carry out certain key functions. It features a relatively small headquarters with geographically dispersed satellite offices along with key functions outsourced to other firms and consultants.
Benefits of Organizational Structures
Putting an organizational structure in place can be very beneficial to a company. The structure not only defines a company's hierarchy but it allows the firm to lay out the pay structure for its employees. The firm can decide salary grades and ranges for each position by putting the organizational structure in place.
The structure also makes operations more efficient and much more effective. The company can seamlessly perform different operations at once by separating employees and functions into separate departments.
A very clear organizational structure also informs employees on how best to get their jobs done. Employees will have to work harder at buying favors or courting those with decision-making power in a hierarchical organization.
Employees must take on more initiative and bring creative problem-solving to the table in a decentralized organization. This can also help set expectations for how employees can track their growth within a company and emphasize a certain set of skills. It can help potential employees gauge whether such a company would be a good fit with their interests and work styles.
What Are Some Types of Organizational Structures?
Organizational structures take on many forms. Examples include functional, multi-divisional, flat, and matrix structures as well as circular, team-based, and network structures.
What Are the Key Elements of an Organizational Structure?
Key elements of an organizational structure include how certain activities are directed to achieve the goals of an organization. They include rules, roles, responsibilities, and how information flows between levels within the company.
What Is an Organizational Structure Example?
A decentralized structure is an example of an organizational structure. It gives individuals and teams high degrees of autonomy without requiring a core team to regularly approve business decisions. Spotify with its ""squads,"" ""tribes,"" and ""guilds,"" and Google with its independent companies are loosely run this way,

What Is an Organizational Structure Chart?
Organizational structures are normally illustrated in some sort of chart or diagram. A pyramid could be used in a centralized structure with the most powerful members of the organization sitting at the top and the least powerful at the bottom.
What Is the Best Organizational Structure?
There's no one best organizational structure. It depends on the nature of the company and the industry in which it operates.
The Bottom Line
Entire fields of study are based on how to optimize and best structure organizations to be the most effective and productive. Senior leaders should consider a variety of factors before deciding which type of organization is
best for their business
, including the business's goals, industry, and culture.

Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s to help investors and traders gauge market volatility and identify when securities are poised to rise or fall.
Bollinger Bands, a popular tool among investors and traders, helps gauge the volatility of stocks and other securities to determine if they are over- or undervalued. Developed in the 1980s by financial analyst John Bollinger, the bands appear on stock charts as three lines that move with the price. The center line is the stock price's 20-day simple moving average (SMA). The upper and lower bands are set at a certain number of standard deviations, usually two, above and below the middle line.
The bands widen when a stock's price becomes more volatile and contract when it is more stable. Many traders see stocks as overbought as their price nears the upper band and oversold as they approach the lower band, signaling an opportune time to trade.
1
While valuable, Bollinger Bands are a secondary indicator that is best used to confirm other analysis methods. Below, we guide you through how to interpret Bollinger Bands, when the tool is best used, and what other indicators are best matched with it.
Key Takeaways
Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool used to determine where prices are high and low relative to each other.
These bands are composed of three lines: a simple moving average (the middle band) and an upper and lower band.
The upper and lower bands are typically two standard deviations above or below a 20-period simple moving average (SMA).
The bands widen and narrow as the volatility of the underlying asset changes.

Who Is John Bollinger?
John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, has been a major influence in technical analysis and is best known for developing Bollinger Bands in the 1980s. Bollinger combined his background in mathematics and engineering with financial market analysis to create this tool, which uses a moving average and the statistical measure of standard deviation to assess the volatility and trends of stock prices.
2
The tool has since become a staple in technical analysis. He is also the founder of Bollinger Capital Management, a money management company, and has been a prominent commentator and analyst on market conditions.

Constructing Bollinger Bands
The three lines that make up Bollinger Bands are based on a security's price moves. The center line is the intermediate-term trend and is typically a 20-day
SMA
of the closing prices. The upper and lower bands are plotted a distance from the SMA set by a certain number of standard deviations, usually two, above and below the center line.

To calculate the bands, you first determine the number of periods used for both the SMA and standard deviation, and the number of standard deviations for the upper and lower bands should be from the center line. While the settings can be adjusted based on your strategy, most times, you would use a 20-day SMA and two standard deviations.
4
The upper band is found by adding two standard deviations to the center SMA line, while the lower band is calculated by subtracting two standard deviations from the center line. The bands automatically widen when price volatility increases and narrow when volatility goes down.
You don't need to break out your calculator and graph paper: Many popular trading platforms, like TradingView, include this technical indicator as a standard feature. Thus, you can easily overlay Bollinger Bands onto price charts. You can also usually customize the Bollinger Bands' settings (increasing or lowering the periods and standard deviations) to fit your needs.
Given that the bands are plotted two standard deviations away from the SMA, they can indicate when prices are statistically high or low. Many traders consider the area near the upper band to be overbought territory—the price is poised to fall—and a potential resistance level where sellers may step in. Conversely, the area near the lower band is often seen as oversold—the price is poised to go up—and a potential support level where buyers could enter the market.
How To Trade With Bollinger Bands
Option traders and investors
use Bollinger Bands to assess market volatility and identify potential entry and exit points. The tool is premised on the idea that prices tend to remain within the bands' upper and lower limits.
One use is for
trend analysis
. The direction of the middle band can indicate a trend's strength: when the middle band is heading upward, this suggests an uptrend, and the converse when heading downward. In addition, the width of the bands reflects market volatility. Narrow bands indicate less volatility, which means a significant price move could be imminent. This is known as a ""squeeze."" Conversely, wide bands indicate more volatility.
5
Another way to use the tool is to figure out when an asset is overbought and oversold. As the price touches or moves outside the upper band, it could be overbought, suggesting a potential selling or short opportunity. Similarly, if the price touches or falls outside the lower band, the asset may be oversold, indicating a possible buying opportunity.
The bands can also help find price targets. For instance, after a price ""bounces"" off the lower band, the upper band becomes a potential exit point if the price trend reverses. Likewise, after a price move that touches the upper bands, the lower band becomes a possible target if a reversal occurs.
Another strategy is called the ""Bollinger Bounce."" This is based on the idea that prices tend to return to the middle band. Traders may buy or sell based on the rebound from the upper or lower bands toward the middle band, especially in a ranging market.
6
Below is a table of different ways the Bollinger Bands can move, what they indicate, and how traders often react. We then go through these moves in more detail so you understand the strategies better.

The harmonic mean is a way to average a series of financial ratios.
What Is the Harmonic Mean?
The harmonic mean is an average that's very useful when used to average multiples like the price-to-earnings ratio.
It is calculated by dividing the number of values in a series by the total of the reciprocals of each number. Thus, the harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.
Key Takeaways
The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.
It is used in finance to average data like price multiples.
The harmonic mean weights each value in a series equally, while the weighted harmonic mean assigns different weights according to a value's importance.
The harmonic mean is also used by market technicians to identify patterns such as
Fibonacci sequences
.
Formula and Calculation
To calculate a harmonic mean, take the reciprocal of each number in a series. Add them up. Then divide the number of values in the series by that total.
So for instance, to calculate the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4, take the reciprocal of each number. Total those. Next, divide the number of values by that total, as follows:

The harmonic mean of 1,4, and 4 is 2.
Important
The reciprocal of a number n is simply 1 / n.
Using the Harmonic Mean
The harmonic mean has uses in finance and the technical analysis of securities markets. It helps to find multiplicative or divisor relationships between fractions without worrying about common denominators.
The harmonic mean is used as well when averaging rates such as the average travel speed over several trips.
In particular, the harmonic mean is used to average multiples (like the
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
) because it gives equal weight to each data point. It's felt that the result is less biased and more accurate because of the equal treatment.
There is also a weighted harmonic mean, which weights certain values more heavily than others if they are known to have greater importance.
The weighted harmonic mean of x1, x2, x3 with the corresponding weights w1, w2, w3 is given as:
∑

Arithmetic Mean and Geometric Mean
Three types of means, the harmonic,
arithmetic
, and geometric, are known as the Pythagorean means. The distinctions between the three types of Pythagorean means make them suitable for different uses.
An arithmetic average is the sum of a series of numbers divided by the count of that series of numbers.
To find the class (arithmetic) average of test scores, simply add up all the test scores of the students, and then divide that sum by the number of students.
A weighted
arithmetic mean
gives greater weight to high data points than low data points (e.g., in finance, because P/E ratios aren't price-normalized while the earnings are equalized).
The
geometric mean
is the average of a set of products, the calculation of which is commonly used to determine the performance results of an investment or
portfolio
.
It is technically defined as ""the
nth
root product of
n
numbers."" The geometric mean must be used when working with
percentages
, which are derived from values, while the standard arithmetic mean works with the values themselves.
Fast Fact
The harmonic mean is best used for fractions such as rates or multiples.
Example of the Harmonic Mean
One company has a
market capitalization
of $100 billion and earnings of $4 billion (P/E of 25), and another company has a market capitalization of $1 billion and earnings of $4 million (P/E of 250).
Say that you want to find out the average P/E ratio for an index made up of those two stocks. With 10% invested in the first company and 90% invested in the second, you'd use the weighted harmonic mean formula for your computation.
Let's also compare the weighted harmonic mean to the weighted arithmetic mean to see how they're different.
The average P/E ratio of the index is:

The weighted arithmetic mean significantly overestimates the mean price-to-earnings ratio.
Advantages and Disadvantages
The harmonic mean incorporates all the entries in a series and is impossible to compute if any item is disallowed.
Using the weighted harmonic mean allows a more significant weighting to be given to smaller values in the series, and it can also be calculated for a series that includes negative values.
In comparison with the arithmetic mean and geometric mean, the harmonic mean generates a straighter curve.
However, there are also a few downsides to using the harmonic mean. It requires using the reciprocals of the numbers in the series, so the calculation of harmonic mean can be complex and time-consuming.
It is also not feasible to calculate the harmonic mean if the series contains a zero value.
Finally, any extreme values on the high or low end of the series have an intense impact on the results of the harmonic mean.
What Is the Difference Between Harmonic Mean and Arithmetic Mean?
The harmonic mean is calculated by dividing the number of values in a series by the reciprocal of each number. In contrast, the arithmetic mean is the sum of a series of numbers divided by the number of values in that series. The harmonic mean is equal to the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.
When Is the Harmonic Mean Used?
The harmonic mean is best used for fractions such as rates or multiples. It is used in finance to average price multiples, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Market technicians may also use the harmonic mean to
identify patterns
such as Fibonacci sequences.
What Affects the Calculation of the Harmonic Mean?
The harmonic mean includes all the entries in a series and allows more weighting to smaller values. Harmonic mean can be calculated for a series that includes negative values, although it is impossible to compute when the series includes a value of zero.
The Bottom Line
The harmonic mean is calculated by dividing the number of entries in a series by the total of the reciprocals of each number.
The harmonic mean stands out from the other types of Pythagorean mean—the arithmetic mean and geometrical mean—by using reciprocals and giving greater weight to smaller values, when necessary.

A rate of return (RoR) indicates how much an investment’s value has changed over time relative to what it cost.
What Is a Rate of Return (RoR)?
An investment’s rate of return (RoR) is a measurement of how much it has gained or decreased in value when it's purchased at one point and produces cash flow in the future. You’re determining the percentage change from the beginning of the period until the end. It can be applied to any asset from stocks and bonds to fine art.
Key Takeaways
The rate of return (RoR) is used to measure the profit or loss of an investment over time.
The metric of RoR can be used on a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and art.
The effects of inflation are not taken into consideration in the simple rate of return calculation. In the real rate of return calculation, however, they are.
The internal rate of return (IRR) takes into consideration the time value of money.
Knowing the rate of return allows companies to assess the profitability and efficiency of their investments.
Investopedia / Ellen Lindner
Understanding a Rate of Return (RoR)
A rate of return (RoR) can be applied to any investment vehicle, from real estate to bonds to stocks to
fine art
. The RoR works with any
asset
, provided the asset is purchased at one point in time and produces cash flow at some point in the future. Investments are assessed based, in part, on past rates of return, which can be compared against assets of the same type to determine which investments are the most attractive. Many investors like to pick a
required rate of return
before making an investment choice.
The Formula for RoR
The formula to calculate the rate of return (RoR) is:
Rate of return
=
[
(
Current value
−
Initial value
)
Initial value
]
×
1
0

\text{Rate of return} = [\frac{(\text{Current value} - \text{Initial value})}{\text{Initial value}}]\times 100
Rate of return
=
[
Initial value
(
Current value
−
Initial value
)
​
]

This simple rate of return is sometimes called the basic
growth rate
or
return on investment (ROI)
. If you also consider the effect of the time value of money and inflation, the real rate of return can also be defined as the net amount of
discounted cash flows (DCF)
received on an investment after adjusting for inflation.
9.42%
The average annual rate of return for the total stock market between 2015 and 2025, as measured by the growth of the S&P 500 index. Note that actual returns vary widely from year to year and from stock to stock.
1
RoR on Stocks and Bonds
The rate of return calculation for stocks and bonds
is slightly different. Assume an investor buys a stock for $60 a share, owns the stock for five years, and earns a total amount of $10 in
dividends
. If the investor sells the stock for $80, their per-share gain is $80 - $60 = $20. In addition, they have earned $10 in dividend income for a total gain of $20 + $10 = $30. The rate of return for the stock is thus a $30 gain per share, divided by the $60 cost per share, or 50%.
On the other hand, consider an investor who pays $1,000 for a $1,000 par value 5%
coupon bond
. The investment earns $50 in interest income per year. If the investor sells the bond for $1,100 in premium value and earns $100 in total interest, the investor’s rate of return is the $100 gain on the sale, plus $100 interest income divided by the $1,000 initial cost, or 20%.

Real Rate of Return vs. Nominal Rate of Return
The simple rate of return is considered a
nominal rate of return
since it does not account for the effect of inflation over time.
Inflation
reduces the purchasing power of money so $1,000 six years from now is not the same as $1,000 today.
Discounting is one way to account for the time value of money. Once the effect of inflation is taken into account, we call that the
real rate of return
(or the inflation-adjusted rate of return).
Real Rate of Return vs. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
A closely related concept to the simple rate of return is the
compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
. The CAGR is the mean annual rate of return of an investment over a specified period longer than one year, which means the calculation must factor in growth over multiple periods.
To calculate the compound annual growth rate, we divide the value of an investment at the end of the period in question by its value at the beginning of that period; raise the result to the power of one divided by the number of holding periods, such as years; and subtract one from the subsequent result.
Example of RoR
The rate of return can be calculated for any investment, dealing with any kind of asset. Let's take the example of purchasing a home as a basic example for understanding how to calculate the RoR. Say that you buy a house for $250,000 (for simplicity, let's assume you pay 100% cash).
Six years later, you decide to sell the house—maybe your family is growing and you need to move into a larger place. You're able to sell the house for $335,000, after deducting any realtor's fees and taxes. The simple rate of return on the purchase and sale of the house is as follows:

Now, what if, instead, you sold the house for less than you paid for it—say, for $187,500?
The same equation can be used to calculate your loss, or the negative rate of return, on the transaction:

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
The next step in understanding RoR over time is to account for the
time value of money (TVM)
, which the CAGR ignores. Discounted cash flows take the earnings of an investment and discount each of the cash flows based on a
discount rate
. The discount rate represents a minimum rate of return acceptable to the investor, or an assumed rate of inflation. In addition to investors, businesses use discounted cash flows to assess the profitability of their investments.
Assume, for example, a company is considering the purchase of a new piece of equipment for $10,000, and the firm uses a discount rate of 5%. After a $10,000 cash outflow, the equipment is used in the operations of the business and increases cash inflows by $2,000 a year for five years. The business applies present value table factors to the $10,000 outflow and to the $2,000 inflow each year for five years.
The $2,000 inflow in year five would be discounted using the discount rate of 5% for five years. If the sum of all the adjusted cash inflows and outflows is greater than zero, the investment is profitable.
A positive
net cash
inflow also means that the rate of return is higher than the 5% discount rate.
The rate of return using discounted cash flows is also known as the
internal rate of return (IRR)
. The
internal rate of return
is a discount rate that makes the
net present value (NPV)
of all cash flows from a particular project or investment equal to zero. IRR calculations rely on the same formula as NPV does and utilize the time value of money (using interest rates). The formula for IRR is as follows:

A Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan funded using after-tax dollars.
A Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings account that is funded using after-tax dollars. This means that income tax is paid immediately on the earnings that the employee deducts from each paycheck and deposits into the account. As long as certain conditions are met—that is, you must be at least 59½ years old, and you must have had the account for at least five years—withdrawals from the account are
tax free
upon retirement.
This type of plan is different from a traditional
401(k)
plan, which is funded with pretax money. In this case, payroll deductions come out of the employee’s gross income and taxes are due when the money is withdrawn from the account.
1
Key Takeaways
A Roth 401(k) is a type of employer-sponsored retirement savings plan.
Contributions made to a Roth 401(k) are taxed, but earnings and withdrawals made during retirement are tax free.
Contribution limits are adjusted annually for inflation and are announced each year by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Penalties apply if you make withdrawals before you turn 59½ or if you’ve had the account for less than five years.
Matthew Collins / Investopedia
How Roth 401(k)s Work
Investors have many options when it comes to saving for retirement. One of the most common ways to put money aside is through employer-sponsored plans like the
401(k)
. Participation is voluntary and those who take part agree to automatic
payroll deductions
that are transferred into a special retirement account. Some employers even
match employee contributions
up to a certain amount.
1
There are
several varieties of 401(k)s
. The Roth 401(k) option became available at the beginning of 2006, while the traditional 401(k) has been around since 1978. Both were authorized by Congress as
tax-advantaged
retirement plans to encourage employees to save for their retirement.

A traditional 401(k) reduces the employee’s gross income for the year, giving them an instant tax break in addition to a
retirement savings
vehicle. The employee will owe regular
income tax
on every withdrawal made during retirement.
The Roth 401(k) requires that the income tax be paid immediately, so the employee’s real
net income
is reduced by the amount earmarked for savings. But no further taxes will be owed on withdrawals of either the contributions or the profits earned over the years.

Roth 401(k) Contribution Limits
A Roth 401(k) is subject to contribution limits based on the individual’s age. These limits are adjusted annually for
inflation
and released by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
.
The contribution limit for individuals is $23,500 in 2025. Individuals 50 and older can contribute an additional $7,500 as a
catch-up contribution
. In 2024, the contribution limit was $23,000, and the catch-up contribution was $7,500. Unlike other plans, there is no income limit to participate.

Note that you cannot contribute more than your taxable income for the year.
Roth 401(k) Withdrawal Rules
Withdrawals of any contributions and earnings are not taxed as long as the withdrawal is a
qualified distribution
, which means certain criteria must be met. This means that:
8
The Roth 401(k) account must have been held for at least five years.
The withdrawal must have occurred because of a disability, on or after the death of an account owner, or when an account holder reaches at least age 59½.
The IRS has updated the rules for
required minimum distributions (RMDs)
for 2024:
“[F]or 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from
designated Roth accounts
. You must still take RMDs from designated Roth accounts for 2023, including those with a
required beginning date
of April 1, 2024.”
Keep in mind that individuals can withdraw more than the RMD. But there is a penalty if you miss an RMD or if your withdrawal is less than outlined during a calendar year. Previously 50% of the value of the missed withdrawal, this penalty is now 25% of the missed withdrawal’s value. You can reduce the amount of the penalty to 10% if you fix the mistake before the date that the penalty is imposed, which is known as the correction window.
9
Advantages and Disadvantages of Roth 401(k)s
A Roth 401(k) may have the greatest benefit for employees currently in a low tax bracket who expect to move into a higher one after they retire. Contributions made to a Roth 401(k) are taxed at the lower
tax rate
. Distributions are tax free in retirement, making them the greatest single advantage. No matter how much the account grows over the years, that money is still exempt from income taxes after the account holder retires.
The downside is a little more immediate financial pain. Because contributions to a traditional 401(k) are not taxed immediately (but effectively reduce the amount of your gross income), the impact on your take-home pay is reduced and your tax break for the year is maximized. But there’s no such deal with a Roth 401(k). This means that you are out of pocket for (and taxed on) the deposits you make in the year you make them.
5
Pros
Helps people who believe they’ll be in a higher tax bracket later in life
Distributions are tax free during retirement
Earnings grow tax free
Cons
Contributions are made using after-tax dollars
Contributions don’t reduce your taxable income
Roth 401(k)s vs. Other Retirement Accounts
A Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored plan that helps people prepare for retirement. But it’s not the only option available to investors.
Important
A defined contribution plan like a 401(k) may not be sufficient to meet your retirement needs.
401(k) Plans
Like its Roth equivalent, the
traditional 401(k)
is an employer-sponsored plan. This means you can’t set one up on your own. Money is taken out of your paycheck through automatic deductions and transferred into a special account. The money is then invested in a series of
mutual funds
that you choose.
The IRS sets limits on how much you can contribute to the plan each year. This figure is adjusted annually for inflation.
7
Employees below age 50 cannot contribute more than $23,500 in 2025. In 2024, it was $23,000.
Those 50 and older can make a catch-up contribution of $7,500 in 2024 and 2025.
Those age 60, 61, 62 and 63 can make a catch-up contribution of $11,250 in 2025.
Employers can also contribute to their employees’ plans, as long as the total contribution does not exceed the employee’s annual salary. The limit for employer and employee contributions together is capped at $70,000 in 2025, or $77,500 including the catch-up contribution. For 2024, those limits were $69,000 and $76,500, respectively.
10
This plan is a
defined contribution plan
, which means your contributions determine the account balance and how well your account performs. Contributions are made using
pretax dollars
, reducing the income tax you pay. Withdrawals made during retirement are subject to income tax.
11
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
If you don’t have the option to invest in an employer-sponsored plan, you may want to consider an
individual retirement account (IRA)
. This kind of account can be set up by anyone through a financial institution or investment firm, which means anyone who has earned income is entitled to one.
Important
Unlike a Roth 401(k), a Roth IRA is not subject to required minimum distributions.
You can invest in a variety of investments under an IRA, including
stocks
,
bonds
,
exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
, mutual funds, and
real estate investment trusts (REITs)
. Just like the 401(k), there are several types of IRA options available:
12
Traditional IRA
: Contributions made to a traditional IRA are tax deductible, thereby decreasing your taxable income. Withdrawals made during retirement are taxed at your normal income tax rate. For 2025, you can only contribute up to $7,000 if you’re under 50. In 2024, it was up to $7,000. You can make an additional $1,00",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roth401k.asp

Form W-2 reflects the annual income an employer paid an employee and the taxes it withheld for the tax year.
What Is Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement?
Form W-2, also known as the Wage and Tax Statement, is a document an employer sends to each employee and files with the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the end of January following the tax year. The IRS gets a copy.
Form W-2 shows the wages paid by an employer and the amount of income withheld from employee paychecks for income taxes, Social Security taxes, and Medicare taxes.
Key Takeaways
Form W-2 is an IRS tax form that details the income an individual has been paid during the year and the income for taxes that has been withheld and sent to the government.
Employers send W-2s to their employees annually for tax purposes.
They use W-2s to report income taxes and FICA taxes withheld on behalf of employees.
The IRS uses W-2 forms to track individuals' tax obligations.
Who Files Form W-2?
An employer must send out a W-2 form to every employee to whom they paid a salary, wage, or other form of compensation. This does not include contracted or self-employed workers, who file taxes with different forms.
The employer must send the employee the W-2 form on or before Jan. 31 each year so that the employee has the information they need to file an income tax return before the deadline, commonly April 15.
1
2
Employers use W-2 forms to report the income withheld for
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)
taxes and income taxes.
By the end of January, employers must file Form W-2 with the SSA, along with Form W-3, for each employee.
The SSA uses the information on these forms to calculate the Social Security benefits that each worker is entitled to.
3
Important
Tax documents reflect earnings and deductions for the previous year. A W-2 form sent to an employee in January 2025 showed wages paid in 2024.
Information Included on a W-2
Taxpayers will receive multiple W-2s if they work for more than one employer.
Taxpayers input the data found on the W-2 into a
Form 1040
individual tax return, either by hand or electronically. Regardless of the employer or company, every W-2 provides the same information:

State and federal tax sections since employees must file taxes at both levels
Employer information, including the company's federal
Employer Identification Number (EIN)
and state ID number
Employee income for the previous year
Income withheld from the employee's paychecks separated into the withholding for federal income tax, Social Security and Medicare taxes, and more
Tips, if any, that the employee received for the year
How to Read Form W-2
Form W-2 is available on the
IRS website
.
Boxes A-F:
The lettered boxes on a W-2 are for the name and address of the employee and employer, Social Security number, and employer's EIN and state ID number.
Boxes 1-2:
Box 1 shows taxable income, including wages, salary, tips, and bonuses. Box 2 shows how much income for federal income tax the employer withheld.
Boxes 3-4:
Box 3 details the earnings subject to Social Security tax. Box 4 shows the amount of income withheld for Social Security tax.
Boxes 5-6:
Box 5 details how much pay is subject to the
Medicare
tax. Box 6 shows how much income was withheld. The employee portion of the Medicare tax is 1.45% of income.
3
Boxes 7-8:
If any income is in the form of tips, these boxes show how much was reported and subject to tax.
Box 9:
This box was used to reflect a now-defunct tax perk, so it is no longer used.
Box 10:
Box 10 reports how much an employee received from their employer in dependent care benefits (if applicable).
Box 11:
Box 11 details how much
deferred compensation
was received from the employer in a
non-qualified plan
.
Box 12:
Box 12 shows other types of compensation or reductions from taxable income and a single or double letter code for each. It might include contributions to a
401(k) plan
. Codes are detailed in the
IRS's W-2 instructions
.
Box 13:
This box has three sub-boxes designed to report pay not subject to federal income tax withholding for an
employer-sponsored retirement plan
such as a
SIMPLE IRA
, and sick pay via a third-party, such as an insurance policy.
Box 14:
In Box 14, an employer can report any additional tax information that may not fit into the other sections, such as state disability insurance taxes and union dues.
Boxes 15-20:
The last six boxes relate to state and local taxes, including how much income is subject to these taxes and how much was withheld.
Related Tax Forms
Form W-4
Form W-4
is completed by employees when they start working for a company. The employer uses the information on Form W-4 to determine how much income to withhold from paychecks for taxes.
The information on Form W-4 (or sometimes
Form W-9
) helps track payroll, tax withholding, employer-provided benefits, and pre-tax contributions to things like a 401(k) retirement plan.
4
Forms 1099
When income for taxes is not withheld from income received, an employee will receive
Form 1099-MISC
, which details the earnings and any deductions.
A person who is paid by a company for services rendered but isn't an employee receives
Form 1099-NEC
, which shows the amount paid.
All types of 1099 forms should arrive by the end of January following the tax year. Individuals must report this income on their annual tax return.
Form W-2G
Form W-2G
is a tax form that a gaming facility such as a casino may send if a taxpayer received winnings from gambling in the prior year.
5
Form 1098-E and Form 1098-T
Students receive a 1098-E statement when they've paid interest on a federal student loan. They also receive a 1098-T statement reporting college tuition expenses that might entitle students to tax deductions or credits.
6
7
How Do Employees Know If They've Had Enough Tax Deducted During the Year?
When the employee files taxes, the amount of tax withheld according to the W-2 form is deducted from their gross tax obligation. If more tax was withheld than owed, a refund will be issued. The IRS also uses Form W-2 to track an employee’s income and tax liability. If the income reported on an employee’s tax return is less than the income reported on Form W-2, the IRS may audit the taxpayer. Taxpayers must report all salary, wage, and tip income even if that income is not reported on a W-2.
How Much Money Do You Need to Make to Get a W-2?
Individuals commonly receive a W-2 from an employer if they earn at least $600 annually. Contracted individuals or independent contractors are not considered employees and receive a 1099 instead of a W-2.
8
What Is the Difference Between a W-2 and a W-4?
A W-4 is filled out by employees and provides an employer with the information they need to withhold the proper amount of income for taxes from each paycheck. A W-2 is filled out by employers at the end of the tax year and sent to employees so they can prepare their tax returns.
The Bottom Line
Form W-2 is an IRS document that employers must send to an employee, the SSA, and the IRS every year. The form reports an employee's annual wages and the taxes withheld. Employees use the form to file their taxes.

Investopedia,"Federal Funds Rate: What It Is, How It's Determined, and Why It's Important","Close
Definition
The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (mainly banks) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis. In simpler terms, it's the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans to meet their reserve requirements.
The federal funds rate is a cornerstone of U.S. monetary policy and a key driver of economic activity. It refers to the target interest rate range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System.
FOMC's decisions about the federal funds rate have far-reaching economic consequences, and they're one of the few major market indicators widely followed by the nonfinancial press. For instance, when the Federal Reserve cut its influential fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% on Dec. 18, 2024, it warranted major news coverage across the U.S.
1
It marked the first rate cut in over four years and signaled a shift in strategy aimed at bolstering the economy and preventing a rise in unemployment. Such changes in the federal funds rate can impact everything from mortgage and credit card interest rates to business investments and the stock market. Below, we discuss why.
2
Key Takeaways
The federal funds rate is the target interest rate range set by the Federal Open Market Committee.
This is the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight.
The FOMC sets the target federal funds rate eight times a year, based on prevailing economic conditions.
The federal funds rate can influence short-term rates on consumer loans and credit cards.
Investors monitor the federal funds rate because it has an impact on the stock market.
Understanding the Federal Funds Rate
The federal funds rate refers to the interest rate that banks charge other institutions for lending excess cash to them from their
reserve balances
overnight
.
By law, banks must maintain a reserve equal to a certain percentage of their deposits in an account at a Federal Reserve bank. The amount of money a bank must keep in its Fed account is known as a
reserve requirement
and is based on a percentage of the bank's total deposits.

Financial institutions are required to maintain interest-bearing accounts at
Federal Reserve
banks to ensure they have enough money to cover depositors' withdrawals and other obligations. Any money in their reserve that exceeds the required level is available for lending to other banks that might have a shortfall.
5
6
Fast Fact
On Dec. 18, 2024, the FOMC announced that it would cut its target range by a quarter of a percentage point from 4.25% to 4.50%. This was the third cut after two years of rate increases as it fought post-pandemic inflation.
1
The end-of-the-day balances in the bank's account averaged over two-week
reserve maintenance periods
are used to determine whether it meets its reserve requirements. If a bank expects to have end-of-the-day balances greater than what's required, it can lend the excess to an institution that anticipates a shortfall in its balances. The interest rate the lending bank can charge is the federal funds rate, or fed funds rate.
4
7
The FOMC makes its
decisions about rate adjustments
based on key economic indicators that may show signs of inflation, recession, or other issues that can affect sustainable economic growth. The indicators can include measures like the core inflation rate and the durable goods orders report.
8
9
How the Federal Funds Rate Is Adjusted
The FOMC meets eight times a year to set the target federal funds rate range as part of its monetary policy. The committee uses various tools to push the effective federal funds rate into that target range. This rate serves as a benchmark for many other interest rates in the economy and is used to help promote
economic growth
.
The Fed adjusts the federal funds rate in response to economic conditions:
Lowering the rate
: When the Fed wants to stimulate economic growth or prevent unemployment from rising, it lowers the target federal funds rate. This makes borrowing cheaper throughout the economy, encouraging spending and investment.
Raising the rate
: Conversely, when the Fed wants to cool down an overheating economy or combat inflation, it raises the target rate, making borrowing more expensive and encouraging saving.
Holding steady
: In periods of economic stability, the Fed may choose to keep the rate unchanged for extended periods.
These decisions are closely watched by markets and can have significant impacts on various sectors of the economy.
Historical Policy Shifts
The federal funds rate has fluctuated significantly over time, reflecting changing economic conditions and policy approaches. The magnitude of rate changes can vary. While 25 basis point adjustments are standard, the Fed may opt for more significant changes (such as 50 basis points or more) if it believes more dramatic action is needed to influence economic conditions.
For instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed kept rates near zero for several years to stimulate economic recovery. In contrast, periods of high inflation have seen the Fed raise rates aggressively to cool the economy.
The target for the federal funds rate has varied widely over the years in response to the prevailing economic conditions. It was set as high as 20% in the early 1980s in response to inflation. With the coming of the Great Recession, the rate was slashed to a record-low target of 0% to 0.25% in an attempt to encourage growth.
3
In March 2020, the target rate was between 0% and 0.25%. In 2022, to combat inflation, the Fed started raising its rate slowly, a process that continued into 2024.
2
The FOMC increased the target fed funds rate to a range of 5.25% and 5.5% in July 2023. It maintained this range during subsequent meetings and confirmed the range in its June 2024 meeting.
10
On Sept. 18, 2024
, the committee announced that it would cut its target range by half a percentage point to 4.75% to 5%, citing the ""progress on inflation and the balance of risks."" It said it will continue to reduce its Treasury security holds, agency debt, and
mortgage‑backed securities (MBSs)
.
11
The committee then again cut rates in November 2024 by a quarter of a percentage point, and again in December 2024 to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%.
2
Impact of the Fed Funds Rate
The federal funds rate is one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy. That's because it impacts monetary and financial conditions, which in turn have a bearing on critical aspects of the broader economy including employment, growth, and inflation.
The rate also influences short-term interest rates, albeit indirectly, for everything from home and auto loans to credit cards, as lenders often set their rates based on the
prime lending rate
. The prime rate is the rate banks charge their most creditworthy borrowers—a rate that is also influenced by the federal funds rate.
12
13
Investors keep a close watch on the federal funds rate. The stock market typically reacts very strongly to changes in the target rate.
For example, a small decline in the rate can prompt the market to leap higher as the borrowing costs for companies get lower. Many stock analysts pay particular attention to statements by members of the FOMC to try to get a sense of where the target rate may be headed.
Sectors Affected by the Federal Funds Rate
The federal funds rate has far-reaching effects across various sectors of the economy:
Automotive industry
: Car loan rates typically follow trends in the federal funds rate, impacting vehicle sales.
Banking
: Banks use this rate as a basis for setting interest rates on loans and savings accounts, thus impacting the rest of the list here.
Consumer lending
: Credit card rates and personal loan rates are influenced by changes in the federal funds rate.
Corporate investments
: Lower rates spur business expansion and capital investments, while higher rates generally curb such activities.
Foreign exchange
: Rate changes can affect the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, impacting international trade and investment.
Government finance
: The rate influences the cost of government borrowing and can affect budget deficits.
Real estate
: Mortgage rates often move in tandem with the federal funds rate, affecting home buying and refinancing activity. It's a major reason the Fed Funds rate makes national news headlines.
Financial markets
: Changes in the federal funds rate can affect stock prices since it affects corporate profits and investor behavior.
How Does the Federal Funds Rate Work?
The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow or lend excess reserves overnight. The law requires that banks must have a minimum reserve level in proportion to their deposits. This reserve requirement is held at a Federal Reserve bank. When a bank has excess reserve requirements, it may lend these funds overnight to other banks that have realized a reserve deficit.
2
How Is the Federal Funds Rate Determined?
It is customary for the
Federal Open Market Committee
to meet eight times annually to determine the federal funds rate. These rates are influenced by economic indicators, such as the core inflation rate and the durable goods orders report, which provide signals about the economic health of the country.

Definition
TSA PreCheck is an airport security screening program in the United States that allows approved travelers to pass through dedicated security lines without having to remove laptops, liquids, and shoes.
What Is TSA PreCheck?
TSA PreCheck is a U.S. government program that allows travelers deemed low risk to pass through an expedited security screening process at more than 200 U.S. airports.
TSA PreCheck benefits for air
travelers
include faster access to airline boarding gates and an absence of the usual requirements to scan your laptop and jacket. You can even keep your shoes on through security.
About 99% of TSA PreCheck passengers wait less than 10 minutes to pass through security. There are 20 million active members in the PreCheck program, according to the latest report. The application process includes applying through the
TSA website
and attending a brief in-person meeting.
1
2
Key Takeaways
TSA PreCheck benefits include an expedited security screening process at most U.S. airports, skipping the usual screening of personal items like laptops and shoes.
TSA PreCheck is managed by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is charged with airport safety.
Travelers obtain TSA PreCheck status by applying through the TSA website and attending a brief meeting with a TSA “enrollment provider.”
Applicants are fingerprinted and must show identification and citizenship or residency documents.
TSA PreCheck status costs $78 and is good for five years.
How TSA PreCheck Works
TSA PreCheck
travelers often have
dedicated lines at the security checkpoint. They don’t have to remove belts, shoes, or lightweight jackets for separate screening. Their carry-on items are not separately screened, either. They can leave a laptop in its case, and the carry-on bag can include a quart-sized bag with travel-size containers of liquids and gels.
3
The TSA PreCheck program began in December 2013 to speed prescreened travelers through security checkpoints, which get backed up during busy times.

The usual process includes a requirement that
passengers
remove their shoes, heavy jackets, and some electronics and pile them into trays for separate screening. Further delays can be caused by passengers being pulled aside for additional scrutiny if the screening reveals banned items.
These measures aren’t pointless. A would-be terrorist smuggled explosives in his sneakers on a Paris-to-Miami flight in 2001. Dangerous or illegal items can be hidden inside laptops that have had their components removed. Bulky jackets can hide weapons.
5
The TSA PreCheck program identifies passengers who are at very low risk of trying any of these strategies and speeds them through the security checkpoints.
Important
The cost of becoming a traveler with TSA PreCheck status is $78. The fee is nonrefundable and good for five years.
6
Benefits of TSA PreCheck
The TSA PreCheck program benefits anyone who travels frequently for business or leisure reasons. Anyone forced to fly at peak times like holiday weekends will also appreciate the break.
TSA PreCheck benefits
include:
An effective prescreening process that allows you to prove once and for all that you’re a law-abiding citizen and you’re not up to no good
A quicker trip through the security checkpoint at the airport
The chance to skip the minor annoyance of piling your laptop, shoes, and coat in a bin for separate screening
A dedicated line for people with TSA PreCheck status
In short, you’ll spend less time standing in line and more time lounging in the airport cafe.
Applying for TSA PreCheck
More than 200 airports and 90+ airlines accommodate TSA PreCheck travelers. You can begin the application process online via the TSA’s website.
7
However, you have to complete the application process in person at a TSA-authorized enrollment location. You will be fingerprinted and asked for a valid proof of identity and U.S. citizenship documents. Travelers who are foreign citizens must be able to provide certain residency documents to qualify.
The online application takes less than five minutes, on average, and the in-person appointment takes about 10 minutes.
1
Once approved for TSA PreCheck status, you will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN). Use that number anytime you book a flight, and you will automatically have your TSA PreCheck status applied to your boarding pass.
3
Then you can start using those fast lanes reserved for TSA PreCheck passengers.
PreCheck Coverage with Credit Cards
Some
credit card
issuers provide access to TSA PreCheck as a membership benefit. Some offer periodic statement credits for TSA PreCheck, while others allow their members to pay for the program with loyalty points. According to the TSA, these
cards
include, but are not limited to:
8
Bank of America Premium Rewards
Capital One: Spark Miles, Venture, Venture X, Venture X Business
Chase Sapphire Reserve
Citi: Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard, Citi Prestige

Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant American Express
Mastercard: Black Card, Gold Card
Truist: Business Travel Rewards, Enjoy Beyond, Enjoy Travel
UBS Visa Infinite
US Bank: Altitude Connect Visa Signature, Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite, FlexPerks Gold American Express
Other Traveler Programs
TSA PreCheck only applies to air travel. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operates other federal programs such as
Global Entry
,
NEXUS
, and SENTRI that verify the identities of trusted travelers and speed them through security.
The NEXUS program covers prescreened travelers who are traveling between Canada and the United States by plane, car, or boat. It costs $120.
The SENTRI program eases restrictions on travel from the U.S. to Mexico by air or land. It costs $120.
Global Entry lets trusted travelers traveling internationally by plane, ship, or auto quickly move through customs and border protection. It costs $120.
For U.S. citizens, membership in these programs may include a TSA PreCheck membership.
6
DHS also offers FAST (Free and Secure Trade) for commercial truck drivers, to streamline border crossing between the U.S. and Canada or Mexico. It costs $50 and does not include a TSA PreCheck membership.
6
There are also private programs that can speed up your trip. One of them is Clear, a security technology program that uses
biometric
data to help identify passengers. Clear is already used in 59 airports, as well as other locations such as stadiums and arenas.
9
10
TSA PreCheck vs. Global Entry vs. Clear
TSA PreCheck allows prescreened U.S. citizens and permanent residents to skip the lines at U.S. airport security. It
costs
$78 for a five-year membership.
However, TSA PreCheck is only available for flights leaving the U.S. Global Entry is a similar program for international travel, allowing trusted passengers to quickly move through customs and border checkpoints. It costs $120 for five years.
6
Clear is a private program available through some airlines. Clear uses biometric data—such as fingerprints and iris scans—to verify passenger identities, allowing them to move quickly through airport security. It’s in use at some stadiums and arenas, too. Clear costs $199 and only lasts for one year.
9
10
What Are the Requirements for TSA PreCheck?
The TSA PreCheck Application Program is only open to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and lawful permanent residents. Applicants may be ineligible due to incomplete or false application information, violations of transportation security regulations, or disqualifying criminal offenses.
11
Applicants must fill out an online application and schedule an in-person interview at a regional TSA-approved office for screening. A nonrefundable processing fee is required.
3
What Are the TSA PreCheck Benefits?
TSA PreCheck benefits for travelers include fast passage through security at airports and fewer annoyances. PreCheck travelers do not have to pile their laptops, shoes, or overcoats in bins for separate screening. The usual restrictions on liquids and gels apply, but these can stay in the traveler’s carry-on.
How Can I Apply for TSA PreCheck?
First, submit a short online application
via the TSA PreCheck website
, then schedule an in-person interview at an enrollment center. Enrollment centers are located by
ZIP code or address search
.
Can My Children Join Me on the PreCheck Line?
Yes, children ages 12 and younger can join a parent or legal guardian with TSA PreCheck in the dedicated lanes if they’re traveling together, even if they do not have their own Known Traveler Number.
12
Is TSA PreCheck a Security Vulnerability?
Critics have argued that the vetting process is flawed and that those with bad intent can falsify statements made during in-person interviews. Still, there have been no known security incidents related to PreCheck since its inception in 2013.
The Bottom Line
Since 2013, the TSA PreCheck program has allowed prescreened enrollees to speed through airport security via dedicated lanes with less stringent screening criteria. The program is available to all U.S. citizens and legal residents who do not have a criminal history.
To enroll, there is an online application and an in-person interview. The application costs $78, and enrollment lasts five years, after which time it can be renewed for additional five-year periods.

A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to a range of its prices over a certain time period.
What Is a Stochastic Oscillator?
A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular
closing price
of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a
moving average
of the result. It is used to generate
overbought
and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0–100 bounded range of values.
Key Takeaways
A stochastic oscillator is a popular technical indicator for generating overbought and oversold signals.
It is a popular momentum indicator, first developed in the 1950s.
Stochastic oscillators tend to vary around some mean price level since they rely on an asset's price history.
Stochastic oscillators measure the momentum of an asset's price to determine trends and predict reversals.
Stochastic oscillators measure recent prices on a scale of 0 to 100, with measurements above 80 indicating that an asset is overbought and measurements below 20 indicating that it is oversold.
Investopedia / Jessica Olah
Understanding the Stochastic Oscillator
The stochastic oscillator is range-bound, meaning it is always between 0 and 100. This makes it a useful indicator of overbought and oversold conditions.
Traditionally, readings over 80 are considered in the overbought range, and readings under 20 are considered oversold. However, these are not always indicative of impending reversal; very strong trends can maintain overbought or oversold conditions for an extended period. Instead, traders should look to changes in the stochastic oscillator for clues about future trend shifts.
Stochastic oscillator charting generally consists of two lines: one reflecting the actual value of the oscillator for each session and one reflecting its three-day simple moving average. Because price is thought to follow
momentum
, the intersection of these two lines is considered to be a signal that a reversal may be in the works, as it indicates a large shift in momentum from day to day.
Divergence between the stochastic oscillator and trending price action is also seen as an important reversal signal. For example, when a bearish trend reaches a new lower low, but the oscillator prints a higher low, it may be an indicator that bears are exhausting their momentum, and a bullish reversal is brewing.

Notably, %K is referred to sometimes as the
fast stochastic
indicator. The ""slow"" stochastic indicator is taken as %D = 3-period moving average of %K.
The general theory serving as the foundation for this indicator is that in a market trending upward, prices will close near the high, and in a market trending downward, prices close near the low. Transaction signals are created when the %K crosses through a three-period moving average, which is called the %D.
The difference between the slow and fast Stochastic Oscillator is the Slow %K incorporates a %K slowing period of 3 that controls the internal smoothing of %K. Setting the smoothing period to 1 is equivalent to plotting the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.
1
History of the Stochastic Oscillator
The stochastic oscillator was developed in the late 1950s by George Lane. As designed by Lane, the stochastic oscillator presents the location of the closing price of a stock in relation to the high and low prices of the stock over a period of time, typically a 14-day period.
Lane, over the course of numerous interviews, has said that the stochastic oscillator does not follow price, volume, or anything similar. He indicates that the oscillator follows the speed or momentum of price.
Lane also reveals that, as a rule, the momentum or speed of a stock's price movements changes before the price changes direction.
2
In this way, the stochastic oscillator can foreshadow reversals when the indicator reveals bullish or bearish divergences. This signal is the first, and arguably the most important, trading signal Lane identified.
Example of the Stochastic Oscillator
The stochastic oscillator is included in most charting tools and can be easily employed in practice. The standard time period used is 14 days, though this can be adjusted to meet specific analytical needs. The stochastic oscillator is calculated by subtracting the low for the period from the current closing price, dividing by the total range for the period, and multiplying by 100.
As a hypothetical example, if the 14-day high is $150, the low is $125 and the current close is $145, then the reading for the current session would be: (145-125) / (150 - 125) * 100, or 80.
By comparing the current price to the range over time, the stochastic oscillator reflects the consistency with which the price closes near its recent high or low. A reading of 80 would indicate that the asset is on the verge of being overbought.
Relative Strength Index (RSI) vs. Stochastic Oscillator
The
relative strength index
(RSI) and stochastic oscillator are both price momentum oscillators that are widely
used in technical analysis
. While often
used in tandem
, they each have different underlying theories and methods. The stochastic oscillator is predicated on the assumption that closing prices should move in the same direction as the current trend.
Meanwhile, the RSI tracks overbought and
oversold
levels by measuring the velocity of price movements. In other words, the RSI was designed to measure the speed of price movements, while the stochastic oscillator formula
works best in consistent trading ranges
.
In general, the RSI is more useful during
trending markets
, and stochastics more so in sideways or range-bound markets.
3
Limitations of the Stochastic Oscillator
The primary limitation of the
stochastic oscillator
is that it has been known to produce
false signals
. This is when a trading signal is generated by the indicator, yet the price does not actually follow through, which can end up as a losing trade. During volatile market conditions, this can happen quite regularly. One way to help with this is to take the price trend as a filter, where signals are only taken if they are in the same direction as the trend.
How Do You Read the Stochastic Oscillator?
The stochastic oscillator represents recent prices on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 representing the lower limits of the recent time period and 100 representing the upper limit. A stochastic indicator reading above 80 indicates that the asset is trading near the top of its range, and a reading below 20 shows that it is near the bottom of its range.
What Does %K Represent on the Stochastic Oscillator?
On a stochastic oscillator chart, %K represents the current price of the security, represented as a percentage of the difference between its highest and lowest values over a certain time period. In other words, K represents the current price in relation to the asset's recent price range.
What Does %D Represent on the Stochastic Oscillator?
On a stochastic oscillator chart, %D represents the 3-period average of %K. This line is used to show the longer-term trend for current prices, and is used to show the current price trend is contin",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp

Definition
Business cycles are fluctuations in a nation's aggregate economic activity characterized by expansions in various economic activities followed by contractions.
What Is a Business Cycle?
Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of a nation. A cycle consists of expansions in many economic activities occurring at about the same time followed by similarly general contractions. This sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic.
The business cycle is also referred to as the
economic cycle
.
Key Takeaways
Business cycles are composed of concerted cyclical upswings and downswings in the broad measures of economic activity: output, employment, income, and sales.
The alternating phases of the business cycle are expansions and contractions.
Contractions often lead to recessions but the entire phase isn't always a recession.
Recessions often start at the peak of the business cycle when an expansion ends and end at the trough of the business cycle when the next expansion begins.
The severity of a recession is measured by the three Ds: depth, diffusion, and duration.
How a Business Cycle Works
Business cycles are marked by the alternation of the phases of expansion and contraction in aggregate economic activity and the co-movement among economic variables in each phase of the cycle.
Aggregate economic activity is represented by not only real inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (
GDP
) which is a measure of aggregate output but also by the aggregate measures of industrial production: employment, income, and sales. These are the key coincident economic indicators used for the official determination of U.S. business cycle peak and trough dates.
Popular misconceptions about business cycles are that the contractionary phase is a recession and that two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP as an informal rule of thumb means a recession.

Recessions occur during contractions but they're not always the entire contractionary phase. Consecutive declines in real GDP are also one of the indicators used by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) but it's not the definition the organization uses to determine recessionary periods.

A business cycle recovery begins when the recessionary vicious cycle reverses and becomes a virtuous cycle with rising output triggering job gains, rising incomes, and increasing sales that feed back into a further
rise in output
.
The recovery can persist and result in a sustained economic expansion only if it becomes self-feeding. This is ensured by this domino effect driving the diffusion of the revival across the economy.
Important
The stock market isn't the economy so the business cycle shouldn't be confused with
market cycles
which are measured using broad stock price indices.
Measuring Business Cycles
The severity of a recession is measured by the three D's: depth, diffusion, and duration. A
recession's
depth is determined by the magnitude of the peak-to-trough decline in the broad measures of output, employment, income, and sales.
Its diffusion is measured by the extent of its spread across economic activities, industries, and geographical regions. Its duration is determined by the time interval between the peak and the trough.
An expansion begins at the trough or bottom of a business cycle and continues until the next peak. A recession starts at that peak and continues until the following trough.
The NBER determines the business cycle chronology: the start and end dates of recessions and expansions in the United States. Its Business Cycle Dating Committee considers a recession to be ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months and normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.""
3
Fast Fact
The Great Depression featured many recessions, one of which lasted for 44 months.
4
Dating Business Cycles
The Dating Committee typically determines recession start and end dates long after the fact. It ""waited to make its decision until revisions in the National Income and Product Accounts [were] released on July 30 and Aug. 27, 2010"" after the end of the 2007 to 2009 recession and announced the June 2009 recession end date on Sept. 20, 2010.
5
U.S. expansions have lasted longer than U.S. contractions on average. The average expansion lasted about 65 months between 1945 and 2019. The average recession lasted approximately 11 months.
6
The average expansion lasted about 26 months and the average recession about 21 months between the 1850s and World War II. The longest expansion was from 2009 to 2020. It lasted 128 months.
6
Stock Prices and the Business Cycle
The biggest stock price downturns tend to occur around business cycle downturns such as contractions and recessions. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average
and the S&P 500 took steep dives during the Great Recession. The Dow fell 51.1% and the S&P 500 fell 56.8% between Oct. 9, 2007 and March 9, 2009.
7
Businesses assume defensive measures and investor confidence falls during contractionary periods. Many events occur before people in an economy are aware they're in a contraction but the stock market trails what's going on in the economy.
Businesses and investors begin to fear a recession and act accordingly if there's speculation or rumors about a recession or mass
layoffs
, rising unemployment, or decreasing output. Businesses assume defensive tactics, reducing their workforces and budgeting for an environment of falling revenues. Investors flee to investments that are ""known"" to preserve capital. Demand for expansionary investments falls and stock prices drop.
Stock prices tend to fall during economic contractions but the phase doesn't cause stock prices to fall. Fear of a recession causes them to drop.
How Will I Use This in Real Life?
Business cycles aren't just about businesses. They reflect the entire economy and can have a significant impact on your personal life, your plans, and your approach to saving, investing, or spending. Business cycles occur in expansions followed by contractions.
Contractions can hit you blindly. Most people won't immediately realize that the country is entering into this period of a business cycle but the stock market will almost certainly reflect it. This will affect your returns and your investment strategies. This wouldn't be a good time to invest without expert advice and guidance.
Contractions often lead to recessions as well. You might want to batten down and brace yourself personally and as early in the cycle as possible if you do detect a contraction coming on. Your job may be in jeopardy so having an emergency fund in place could be a lifesaver. You'll want to trim your budget at the very least whether it's to save or to make your existing emergency fund last longer.
What Are the Stages of the Business Cycle?
The business cycle generally consists of four distinct phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough.
What Does a Business Cycle Describe?
A business cycle describes the fluctuations in an economy over some time, generally from the start of one recession to the beginning of the next. This would include periods when the economy grows.
Are Business Cycles Predictable?
Business cycles generally aren't predictable. Economies are complex machines that function in a variety of ways and are intertwined. Predicting how they'll move is extremely difficult. There can be signs of changes in an economy such as shifts in inflation and production but predicting an all-out change in the business cycle is very tough if not impossible.
The Bottom Line
The business cycle is the time it takes the economy to go through all four phases of the cycle: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. Expansions are times of increasing profits for businesses and rising economic output is the phase in which the U.S. economy spends the most time. Contractions are times of decreasing profits and lower output and are the phase in which the least amount of time is spent.

What Is a Promissory Note?
A promissory note is a written promise by one party (the note's issuer or maker) to pay another party (the note's payee) a definite sum of money, either on demand or at a specified future date. A promissory note typically contains all the terms involved, such as the principal debt amount, interest rate, maturity date, payment schedule, the date and place of issuance, and the issuer's signature.
Key Takeaways
A promissory note is a financial instrument that contains a written and signed promise between two parties to repay a sum of money in exchange for a loan or other financing.
A promissory note typically contains all the terms pertaining to the indebtedness, such as the principal amount, interest rate, maturity date, date and place of issuance, and issuer's signature.
In terms of their legal enforceability, promissory notes lie somewhere between the informality of an IOU and the rigidity of a loan contract.
Investopedia / Tara Anand
How Promissory Notes Work
Promissory notes can lie between an IOU's informality and a loan contract's rigidity. An IOU merely acknowledges a debt and the amount one party owes another. A promissory note includes a promise to pay on demand or at a specified future date, in addition to steps required for repayment (like the repayment schedule)
Although financial institutions may issue promissory notes—for instance, you might be required to sign one to take out a small personal loan—they also allow companies and individuals to get financing from a non-bank source. This source can be an individual or a company willing to carry the note (and provide the financing) under the agreed-upon terms. In effect, promissory notes can enable anyone to be a lender.
In its simplest form, a promissory note might be a written promise to repay a family member. State or federal securities entities may regulate more complicated promissory notes.
Important
Typically, there are two parties to a promissory note: The promisor, also called the note's maker or issuer, promises to repay the amount borrowed. The promisee or payee is the person who gave the loan.
Secured vs. Unsecured Promissory Notes
A promissory note can be secured or unsecured. A secured promissory note describes the collateral—typically property—that secures the debt or amount borrowed. For example, if the borrower owns property, the lender can use the car as collateral until the debt is repaid. If the borrower doesn't repay the loan, the promissory note permits the lender to take possession of the property.

An unsecured promissory note doesn't involve collateral. In this case, if the borrower doesn't repay the loan, the lender can try to use standard debt-collection procedures.
In either case, the lender holds the promissory note until the debt is repaid. Typically, those drafting a promissory note will consult with an attorney to make sure the note follows any state or federal laws around loans or investments.
2
Important
A promissory note is usually held by the party that's owed money; once the debt has been fully paid, the note must be canceled by the payee and returned to the issuer.
What's Included in a Promissory Note?
A promissory note should include all the details about a loan and the repayment terms. In addition to the names of the borrower and the lender, a promissory note may also include:
3
Name and address of borrower and lender
Maturity date
Sum borrowed
Payment schedule
Interest rate and how interest is calculated
Prepayments process
Overdue payment interest charged
Default
Waivers, amendments, and governing law for the promissory note
Types of Promissory Notes
In the United States, promissory notes are often used when getting a student loan, mortgage, or a loan from a friend or family member. Promissory notes are also sometimes issued to corporate clients.
Student Loan Promissory Notes
Many people sign their first promissory notes as part of getting a
student loan
. Private lenders typically require students to sign promissory notes for each loan taken out.
Some schools allow federal student loan borrowers to sign a one-time master promissory note, allowing receipt of multiple loans for up to 10 years if the school certifies the student's continued eligibility.
Student loan promissory notes outline the student borrower's rights and responsibilities and the loan's conditions and terms. By signing a master promissory note for
federal student loans
, the student promises to repay the loan amounts plus interest and fees to the U.S. Department of Education.
4
The master promissory note also includes the student's personal contact and employment information as well as the names and contact info for the student's references.
Mortgage Promissory Notes
Homeowners usually consider their mortgage an obligation to repay the money they borrowed to buy their residence. But actually, the signed
mortgage promissory note
represents a promise to repay the mortgage or loan, along with the repayment terms.
Typically, the promissory note includes:
5
Amount you owe
Mortgage loan's interest rate
Ways your interest rate can change, if you have an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)
Payment dates
Repayment length of time
Where you send payments
Consequences of not making monthly mortgage payments
The promissory note describes the debt's amount, interest rate, and late fees. A lender holds the promissory note until the mortgage loan is paid off. Unlike the mortgage or
deed of trust
, the promissory note is not entered into county land records.
Corporate Credit Promissory Notes
Promissory notes are commonly used in business as a means of short-term financing. For example, when a company sells products but hasn't yet collected payments, cash may run low, leaving the company unable to pay creditors. The company may ask creditors to accept a promissory note to be exchanged for cash after the company collects its
accounts receivables
.
2
Or the company may ask the bank for cash in exchange for a promissory note. Promissory notes offer companies a credit source after exhausting other options, like corporate loans or bond issues. A note issued by a company in this situation is at a higher risk of default than, say, a corporate bond. The corporate promissory note's interest rate will likely provide a greater return than a bond from the same company, as high risk means higher potential returns.
6
These notes must be registered with the government in the state where sold and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
6
If the note is not registered, the investor has to analyze whether the company is capable of servicing the debt. Companies in dire straits may hire high-
commission brokers
to push unregistered promissory notes on the public. If the company defaults, the investors' legal avenues may be somewhat limited.
Promissory Note Repayment
There are several different structures for repayment of a promissory note, but most involve repaying the principal plus interest. The interest rate can be fixed or variable and calculated daily, monthly, annually, or in another way. In some states, interest rates may be capped by state law.
7
A certified accountant and attorney can advise you on the tax or legal implications of the promissory note's repayment schedule.
2
Here are various repayment approaches for a promissory note:
8
Installment note
: The most familiar repayment approach is through installments, with the borrower making regular payments; the repayment schedule and interest payments can vary.
Simple note:
For smaller loans, borrowers might arrange a
lump-sum repayment
on a specified date, meaning that's when you'll repay the whole amount listed in the promissory note.
Open-ended note
: This promissory note allows the borrower to draw on an operating or other loan over time and repay the draw plus interest by a specific date.
Demand note
: Sometimes, a promissory note may specify ""on demand"" repayment, meaning that the note must be repaid at the lender's request at any time.
Investing in Promissory Notes
Company or corporate promissory notes are rarely sold to the public.

Definition
Fiduciaries are persons or organizations who act on behalf of others and are required to put clients’ interests ahead of their own.
Fiduciaries are persons or organizations that act on behalf of others and are required to put the clients’ interests ahead of their own, with a duty to preserve good faith and trust. Fiduciaries are thus legally and ethically bound to act in the other’s best interests.
A fiduciary may be responsible for the general well-being of another (e.g., a child’s legal guardian), but the task usually involves finances—for example, managing the assets of another person or a group of people. Money managers, financial advisors, bankers, insurance agents, accountants, executors, board members, and corporate officers all have fiduciary responsibilities.
Key Takeaways
Fiduciaries are legally bound to put their client’s best interests ahead of their own.
Fiduciary duties appear in various business relationships, including between a trustee and a beneficiary, corporate board members and shareholders, and executors and legatees.
An investment fiduciary is anyone with legal responsibility for managing somebody else’s money, such as a member of the investment committee of a charity.
Registered investment advisors and insurance agents have a fiduciary duty to their clients.
Broker-dealers may be subject to the less stringent standard set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation Best Interest, implemented in 2019.
Joules Garcia / Investopedia
Understanding Fiduciaries
A fiduciary’s responsibilities and duties are ethical and legal. When a party knowingly accepts a fiduciary duty on behalf of another, they are required to act in the best interest of the principal (i.e., the client or party whose assets they are managing). This is what is known as a “prudent person standard of care,” which stems from an 1830 court ruling,
Harvard College vs. Armory
, and is found in many state laws via the American Law Institute's Uniform Prudent Investor Act from 1994.
1
2
The
prudent-person rule
requires a fiduciary to act first and foremost with the needs of beneficiaries in mind. Strict care must be taken to ensure that no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and the principal.
In many cases, no profit is to be made from the relationship unless explicit consent is granted when the relationship begins. For example, in the United Kingdom, fiduciaries cannot profit from their position, according to an English High Court ruling,
Keech vs. Sandford
(1726).
3
If the principal provides consent, then the fiduciary can keep whatever benefit they have received; these benefits can be either monetary or defined more broadly as an “opportunity.”

Fiduciary duties appear in a wide variety of common business relationships, including the following:
Trustee and beneficiary (the most common type)
Corporate board members and shareholders
Executors and legatees
Guardians and wards
Promoters and stock subscribers
Lawyers and clients
Investment corporations and investors
Insurance companies/agents and policyholders
Fast Fact
Fiduciary negligence
is a form of professional malpractice when a person fails to honor their fiduciary obligations and responsibilities.
Fiduciary Relationship Between Trustee and Beneficiary
Estate arrangements and trusts involve both a trustee and a beneficiary. An individual named as a trust or estate
trustee
is the fiduciary, and the beneficiary is the principal. Under a trustee/beneficiary duty, the fiduciary has legal ownership of the property or assets and holds the power necessary to handle assets held in the name of the trust. In estate law, the trustee may also be known as the estate’s executor.
Trustees must make decisions that are in the best interest of the beneficiary, as the latter holds equitable title to the property. The trustee/beneficiary relationship is an important aspect of estate planning, and special care should be taken to determine who is to be the trustee.
4
Politicians often set up blind trusts to avoid real or perceived conflict-of-interest scandals. A blind trust is a relationship in which a trustee is in charge of all investments of a beneficiary’s assets without the beneficiary knowing how the assets are being invested. Even though the beneficiary has no knowledge, the trustee has a fiduciary duty to invest according to the prudent person standard of conduct.
5
6
Fiduciary Relationship Between Board Members and Shareholders
A similar fiduciary duty can be held by
corporate directors
, as they can be considered trustees for stockholders if on the board of a corporation, or trustees of depositors if they serve as the director of a bank.
7
Specific duties include the following:
Duty of care
Duty of care
applies to how the board makes decisions that affect the future of the business. The board has the duty to thoroughly investigate all possible decisions and how they might affect the business.
8
If the board is voting to elect a new chief executive officer, for example, the decision should not be based solely on the board’s knowledge or opinion of one possible candidate; it is the board’s responsibility to investigate all viable applicants to ensure that the best person for the job is chosen.
Duty to act in good faith
Even after the board reasonably investigates all the options before it, it has the responsibility to choose the option it believes best serves the interests of the business and its shareholders.
9
Duty of loyalty
Duty of loyalty
means the board is required to put no other cause, interest, or affiliation above its allegiance to the company and the company’s investors. Board members must refrain from personal or professional dealings that might put their own self-interest or that of another person or business above the interests of the company.

If a member of a board of directors is found to be in breach of their fiduciary duty, they can be held liable in a court of law by the company or its shareholders.

Fast Fact
Contrary to popular belief, there is no legal mandate that a corporation is required to maximize shareholder returns.
More Examples of Fiduciaries
Fiduciary relationship between executor and legatee
Fiduciary responsibilities can also apply to specific or one-time transactions. For example, a fiduciary deed is used to transfer property rights in a sale when a fiduciary must act as an executor of the sale on behalf of the property owner. A fiduciary deed is useful when a property owner wishes to sell but can't handle their affairs due to illness, incompetence, or other circumstances and needs someone to do so for them.
A fiduciary is required by law to disclose to the potential buyer the true condition of the property being sold, and they cannot receive any financial benefits from the sale. A fiduciary deed is also useful when the property owner has died, and their property is part of an estate that needs oversight or management.
Fiduciary relationship between guardian and ward
Under a guardian/ward relationship, the legal guardianship of a minor is transferred to an appointed adult. As the fiduciary, the guardian is tasked with ensuring the minor child or ward has appropriate care, which can include deciding where the minor attends school, that the minor has suitable medical care, that they are disciplined in a reasonable manner, and that their daily welfare remains intact.
A guardian is appointed by the state court when the natural guardian of a minor child can't care for the child. In most states, a guardian/ward relationship remains intact until the minor child reaches the age of majority.
Fiduciary relationship between attorney and client
The attorney/client fiduciary relationship is one of the most stringent and well-known. The U.S. Supreme Court states that the highest level of trust and confidence must exist between an attorney and a client and that an attorney, as a fiduciary, must act with complete fairness, loyalty, and fidelity when dealing with and representing their clients.
Attorneys are held liable for breaches of their fiduciary duties to the client and are accountable to the court, where that client is represented when a breach occurs.

Fiduciary relationship between principal and agent
A more generic example of fiduciary duty lies in the principal/agent relationship. Any person, corporation, partnership, or government agency can act as a principal or agent as long as the person or business has the legal",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp

Definition
A partnership is a formal business arrangement between two or more individuals who agree to manage and operate a business together while sharing its profits and liabilities.
What Is a Partnership?
A partnership is a formal arrangement by two or more parties to manage and operate a business and share its profits.
There are several types of partnership arrangements. In a general partnership, all partners share liabilities and profits equally. In other types of partnerships, profits may be shared in different percentages or some partners may have
limited liability
. Partnerships may also have a ""silent partner,"" in which one party is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.
The type of partnership that business partners choose will depend on how they want to manage day-to-day operations, who is willing to be financially liable for the business, and how they want to pay taxes.
Key Takeaways
A partnership is an arrangement between two or more people to oversee business operations and share its profits and liabilities.
In a general partnership company, all members share both profits and liabilities.
In other partnership structures, some partners may share a smaller percentage of the profits but not assume any liability for the business.
Professionals like doctors and lawyers often form a limited liability partnership.
There may be tax benefits to forming a partnership instead of a corporation.
Investopedia / Matthew Collins
Types of Partnerships
In a broad sense, a partnership can be any endeavor undertaken jointly by multiple parties. The parties may be governments, nonprofits enterprises, businesses, or private individuals. The goals of a partnership also vary widely.
Within the narrow sense of a for-profit business undertaken by two or more individuals, there are three main categories of partnership:
general partnership
, limited partnership, and limited liability partnership.
General Partnership
In a general partnership, all parties share legal and financial liability equally. The individuals are personally responsible for the debts the partnership takes on. Profits are also shared equally. The specifics of profit sharing should be laid out in writing in a partnership agreement.
Important
When drafting a partnership agreement, an expulsion clause should be included, detailing what events are grounds for expelling a partner.
Limited Liability Partnership
Limited liability partnerships
(LLPs) are a common structure for professionals, such as accountants, lawyers, and architects. This arrangement limits partners' personal liability so that, for example, if one partner is sued for malpractice, the assets of other partners are not at risk.
1
Some law and accounting firms make a further distinction between equity partners and salaried partners. The latter is more senior than associates but does not have an ownership stake. They are generally paid bonuses based on the firm's profits.
Limited Partnership
Limited partnerships are a hybrid of general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. At least one partner must be a general partner, with full personal liability for the partnership's debts. At least one other is a silent partner whose liability is limited to the amount invested. This silent partner generally does not participate in the management or day-to-day operation of the partnership.
1
Fast Fact
A limited liability limited partnership is a limited partnership that provides a greater shield from liability for its general partners. This is not a common type of partnership.
2
Taxes and Partnerships
There is no federal statute defining partnerships, but the Internal Revenue Code (Chapter 1, Subchapter K) includes detailed rules on their federal tax treatment.
3
Partnerships are pass-through businesses, meaning the partnership itself does not pay income tax. The tax responsibility passes through to the individual partners, who are not considered employees for tax purposes.
3
Individuals in partnerships may receive
more favorable tax treatment
than if they founded a corporation. This is because corporate profits are taxed, as are the dividends paid to owners or shareholders. The profits from a partnership, on the other hand, are not double-taxed in this way.
3
Advantages and Disadvantages of Partnerships
Like any business structure, a partnership comes with both benefits and drawbacks.
Most sole proprietors do not have the time or resources to run a successful business alone, and the startup stage can be the most time-consuming. A successful partnership can increase the chances that a business will launch successfully by
allowing partners to pool
their resources and abilities.
Creating a partnership
can also make the day-to-day operations of a business more manageable than they would be if only one person were running things. Partners to benefit from one another's labor, time, and expertise. Moreover, a shrewd partner can also provide additional perspectives and insights that can help the business grow.
There is, however, risk in joining a partnership. In addition to sharing profits, the partners may also assume responsibility for any losses or debts from the other partners. There is also a higher chance of conflict or mismanagement. When the time comes to exit, it may be harder to reach an agreement about selling the business.
Pros
Combine labor and capital to launch
Share management and operations responsibilities
Variety of experiences and new perspectives
Cons
Additional debts or liabilities
Risk disagreement or mismanagement
Difficulty selling or exiting the business
Partnerships by Country
The basic varieties of partnerships can be found throughout common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, the U.K., and the Commonwealth nations. There are, however, differences in the laws governing them in each jurisdiction.
The U.S. has no federal statute that defines the various forms of partnership. However, every state except Louisiana has adopted one form or another of the
Uniform Partnership Act
, creating laws that are similar from state to state.
4
The standard version of the act defines the partnership as a separate legal entity from its partners, which is a departure from the previous legal treatment of partnerships.
Important
The Uniform Partnership Act only applies to general and limited liability partnerships (LLPs). It does not apply to limited partnerships (LPs).
Other common law jurisdictions, including England, do not consider partnerships to be independent legal entities.
5
How Does a Partnership Differ From Other Forms of Business Organization?
A partnership is a business structure that involves two or more individuals who agree to a set distribution of ownership, responsibilities, and profits and losses. Unlike the owners of LLCs or corporations, partners are personally held liable for any business debts of the partnership, which means that creditors or other claimants can go after the partners' personal assets.  Because of this, individuals who wish to form a partnership should be selective when choosing partners.
1
If Partners Don't Have Limited Liability Why Set Up a Partnership?
Partnerships have several benefits. They are often easier to set up than LLCs or corporations and do not involve a formal incorporation process through a government. This has the added benefit of not being subject to the same rules and regulations that apply to corporations and LLCs. Partnerships also tend to be more tax-friendly.
What Is a Limited Partnership vs. a Limited Liability Partnership?
In limited partnerships (LPs), general partners manage operations of the firm and have full liability. Limited (silent) partners are not involved in day-to-day operations and enjoy limited liability. A limited liability partnership (LLP) is different from an LP.  In an LLP, partners are not exempt from liability for the debts of the partnership, but they may be exempt from liability for the actions of other partners. A limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) combines aspects of LPs and LLPs.
1
Do Partnerships Pay Taxes?
A partnership itself does not pay business taxes. Instead, taxes are passed through to the individual partners to file on their own tax returns, often via a
Schedule K
.

What Types of Businesses Are Best-Suited for Partnerships?
Partnerships are often best for a group of professionals in the same line of work where each partner has an active role in running the business. These often include medical professionals, lawyers, accountants, consultants, finance & investing, and ar",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp
Investopedia,"Knock-In Option Explained, With Different Types, Examples","Close
What is a Knock-In Option?
A knock-in option is a latent option contract that begins to function as a normal option (""knocks in"") only once a certain price level is reached before expiration. Knock-ins are a type of
barrier option
that are classified as either a
down-and-in
or an
up-and-in
. A barrier option is a type of contract in which the payoff depends on the
underlying security's
price and whether it hits a certain price within a specified period.
Key Takeaways
A knock-in option is a type of barrier option which is triggered only after the underlying asset's price reaches a certain specified barrier.
There are two types of knock-in options: down-and-in and up-and-in. In the former, the option is triggered only if the underlying asset's price falls below a certain level. The latter type of option is triggered only after an underlying asset's price rises to a certain level.
Understanding Knock-In Options
Knock-in options are one of the two main types of barrier options, with the other type being
knock-out options
.
A knock-in option is a type of contract that is not an option until a certain price is met. So if the price is never reached, it is as if the contract never existed. However, if the underlying asset reaches a specified barrier, the knock-in option comes into existence. The difference between a knock-in and knock-out option is that a knock-in option comes into existence only when the underlying security reaches a barrier, while a knock-out option ceases to exist when the underlying security reaches a barrier.
Barrier options typically have cheaper
premiums
than traditional
vanilla options
, primarily because the barrier increases the chances of the option expiring worthless. A trader may choose the cheaper (relative to a comparable vanilla) barrier option if they feel it is quite likely the underlying will hit the barrier.
Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020
Down-and-In Knock-In Option
Assume an investor purchases a down-and-in
put option
with a barrier price of $90 and a
strike price
of $100. The underlying security is trading at $110, and the option
expires
in three months. If the price of the underlying security reaches $90, the option comes into existence and becomes a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value.
The put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the underlying security rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless. Just because the barrier is reached does not assure a profit on the trade since the underlying would need to stay below $100 (after triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value.
Up-and-In Knock-In Option
Contrary to a down-and-in option, an up-and-in option comes into existence only if the underlying reaches a barrier price that is above the current underlying's price. For example, assume a trader purchases a one-month up-and-in
call option
on an underlying asset when it is trading at $40 per share. The up-and-in call option contract has a strike price of $50 and a barrier of $55. If the underlying asset does not reach $55 during the life of the option contract, it expires worthless. However, if the underlying asset rises to $55 or above, the call option would come into existence and the trader would be
in the money

What Is Wealth Management?
Wealth management is an investment advisory service that uses financial services to address the needs of affluent clients.
Using a consultative process, the advisor gleans information about a client’s wants and specific situation. They then tailor a personalized strategy that uses a range of financial products and services to help the client achieve their goals.
Wealth management often takes a comprehensive approach. That is, to meet the complex needs of an affluent client, a broad range of services—such as money management, financial planning, investment advice, estate planning, accounting, life insurance, retirement, and tax services—may be provided.
While fee structures vary across comprehensive wealth management services, typically, fees are based on a client’s assets under management (AUM).
Key Takeaways
Wealth management is a financial service that addresses the full complement of the needs of affluent clients.
An advisor in this field is a high-level financial professional who manages an affluent client’s wealth holistically.
Fees can vary according to the services provided, but normally there is a set fee based on AUM.
This service is usually appropriate for wealthy individuals with a broad array of diverse needs.
Services can include
estate planning
, accounting,
retirement
planning, tax planning, and more.

Understanding Wealth Management
Wealth management is more than just investment advice. It can encompass all parts of a person’s financial life.

×
The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
Instead of receiving advice and various products from multiple professionals,
high-net-worth individuals
may be more likely to benefit from an integrated approach, where all services come from or are managed by a single source.
Serving the Needs Associated With Substantial Wealth
In this approach, a wealth manager coordinates the various services needed to handle their clients’ assets. They will create a strategic plan for their current and future needs. Those needs may include will and trust services,
business succession planning
, wealth transfer, and more.
Some wealth managers provide services in any aspect of the financial field while others choose to specialize in particular areas, such as cross-border wealth management. This specialization may be based on the expertise of a particular manager or the primary focus of a wealth management firm.
In certain instances, an advisor may coordinate input from outside financial experts, as well as from the client’s own service professionals (for example, an attorney or accountant) to craft the optimal strategy to benefit the client. Some managers also provide banking services or advice on
philanthropic activities
.
Example
Generally speaking, wealth management offices employ experts and professionals in different fields. For instance, consider a client who has $10 million in investable assets—in addition to
a trust for their grandchildren
—and a partner who has recently passed away.
Such an office would not only invest these funds in a discretionary account but also provide will and trust services required for tax minimization and estate planning.
A
family office
is a type of private wealth management firm that handles these needs and much more for ultra-high-net-worth clients. For example, its staff may also provide budgeting assistance, money education services, and concierge services for non-financial needs (such as household management, schooling, and travel).
Business Structures
Wealth managers may work as part of either a small-scale business or a larger firm, one generally associated with the financial industry. Depending on the business, wealth managers may function under different titles, including
financial consultants
or financial advisors.
A client may receive services from a single designated wealth manager or may have access to the members of a specified wealth management team.
Advisors in the direct employ of an investment firm may have more knowledge of investment strategies, while those who work for a large bank may focus on the management of trusts and available credit options, overall estate planning, or insurance options. In short, expertise may vary across different firms.
Note
Newer, fully-automated
roboadvisor
platforms intended as wealth management tools for ordinary individuals often charge far less than 1% per year of AUM and come with low minimum account balances to get started.
Fees
Wealth managers can
charge for their services
in several ways. Some work as fee-only advisors and charge an annual, hourly, or flat fee. Some work on commission and are paid through the investments that they sell.
Fee-based advisors earn a combination of a fee plus commissions on the investment products that they sell.
A survey of financial advisors found that the median advisory fee (up to $1 million
AUM
) is just around 1%. However, some advisors charge more, especially on smaller account balances. Individuals with larger balances can often pay substantially less, with the median AUM fee declining as assets increase.
1
Credentials
Check the credentials of a professional of interest for an idea of their designation and training. You want to select someone who best suits your needs and situation.
The top three
professional advisor credentials
are Certified Financial Planner, Chartered Financial Analyst, and Personal Financial Specialist. Many websites for professional certifying organizations allow you to vet if a member is in good standing or has had disciplinary actions or complaints.

The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
has a tool that explains professional designations. You can also see whether the issuing organization requires continuing education, takes complaints, or has a way for you to confirm who holds the credentials.
4
What Do Wealth Managers Earn?
According to Indeed, the average salary for a wealth manager in the United States was approximately $132,000 in 2024.
5
Is a Wealth Manager the Same As a Financial Planner?
While some professionals are both wealth managers and financial planners, a key difference between
financial planners and wealth managers
is that the latter are focused on assets and investments, while planners also consider everyday household finances, insurance needs, and so on.
How Much Money Does the Wealth Management Industry Manage?
As of 2024, it is estimated that the industry had assets under management of over $128.9 trillion globally. This figure is expected to grow to $145.4 trillion by 2025.
6
7
The Bottom Line
A wealth manager starts by developing a plan that will maintain and/or increase a client’s wealth based on their financial situation, goals, and
risk tolerance
.
Each part of a client’s financial picture, whether it's
tax planning
or wills and estates, is coordinated by a wealth manager to protect the wealth of the client and help them achieve their goals.
A wealth manager meets regularly with clients to update goals and rebalance the financial portfolio. At the same time, they may investigate whether additional services are needed. The ultimate goal is to remain in the client’s service throughout their lifetime.

What Is an Original Issue Discount (OID)?
An original issue discount (OID) is the discount in price from a bond's
face value
at the time a
bond
or other debt instrument is first issued.
Bonds can be issued at a price lower than their face value—known as a
discount
. The OID is the amount of discount or the difference between the original face value and the price paid for the bond.
Original issue discounts are used by bond issuers to attract buyers to purchase their bonds so that the issuers can raise funds for their business. Many
zero-coupon bonds
use large OIDs to entice buyers to their products.
Key Takeaways
The original issue discount (OID) is the difference between the original face value amount and the discounted price paid for a bond.
OID bonds have the potential for gains since investors can buy the bonds for a lower price than their face value.
OID bonds sold at a discount could indicate an issuer is facing financial difficulty and default is possible.
How an Original Issue Discount (OID) Works
Once purchased, the bond's issuer usually pays the bondholder an interest rate—called a
coupon
—while the investor holds the bond. Periodically, the bondholder receives interest payments based on the rate of the bond. When the bond reaches
maturity
, the investor gets the return of the face value paid for the bond.
However, some bonds sell for a price less than the face or par value of the note. The OID is the difference between the price paid for a bond and its face value. The OID may be considered interest since the buyer is paid the face value of the bond at maturity even though the purchase price was lower than the face value.
Take the Next Step to Invest

The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
For example, let's say that a bond has a $100 face value, meaning the investor would receive $100 returned at the maturity date. If the investor buys the bond for $95 and receives $100 at maturity, the OID is $5, which is the return on the investment.
If a bond offering the OID is zero-coupon, then the only money made is at maturity when the face value is paid back.
Formula and Calculation of OID
The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price and the issuance price (the discounted offering price of the debt.)
OID = Redemption Price – Issuance Price
Redemption Price: The par value of the bonds (the amount obligated to be returned on the date of maturity.)
Issuance Price: The offering price that the bonds were sold for on the date of sale.
Example of How to Calculate OID
Let's say that a company wants to offer a $100,000 bond (redemption price), but is willing to accept $90,000 in capital (issuance price). Therefore, the OID equals $10,000:
OID
=
$100,000 - $90,000 = $10,000
OIDs and Interest Rates
A company can have a bond that sells
at a discount
to its face value while it also pays periodic interest. However, the amount of OID tends to correlate with the interest rate on the bond inversely. In other words, the bigger the discount, the lower the coupon rate offered on the bond.
The reason for the negative correlation is that companies might issue a bond at a discount to its face value, so the company does not have to pay a regular, and ongoing higher interest rate to investors. Although interest earned on a bond is income for investors, it's an expense for companies.
Conversely, the higher the rate on a bond, the less it is likely to sell at a discount, and its OID, if any, would be smaller. If a bond's rate is attractive to investors, there will likely be many buyers and demand for the bond, so it's not likely it will sell for much of a discount.
Investors should understand that just because they are buying a bond at a discount, it does not mean it is a bargain. The return received for the OID may end up being less than the return from a non-OID bond, bearing higher interest, or another
fixed-income security
. Comparison is important as the original issue discount plus the total of regular coupon payments must be higher than alternatives to make it a bargain.
OIDs and Zero-Coupon Bonds
The bonds with the highest original issue discounts are typically
zero-coupon bonds
. As the name indicates, these debt instruments do not pay a coupon interest payment. Without this to entice buyers, they must offer deeper discounts as compared to bonds that pay interest and sell at their face values. The only way for investors to earn income from a zero-coupon bond is from the difference between the bond's purchase price, and its face value at maturity.
Zero-coupon bonds save the costs of interest payments for the issuer at the expense of the lower initial selling price. Once the bonds mature, they are redeemed for full face value.
If interest rates rise significantly, existing fixed-rate bonds become less attractive, and their prices fall as investors sell them for higher-rate bonds elsewhere. Conversely, if interest rates fall significantly, existing fixed-rate bonds become more attractive, and their prices rise as investors rush to buy them. Even though many OID bonds don't pay any interest, this trend applies to them as well. Since bonds with higher rates would make the OID bonds less attractive, and lower yielding bonds would make them more attractive.
Without the impact of changes to the
market interest rate
, some consider these investments low-risk. However, zero-coupon bonds are generally not as liquid, so there will be limited buyers and sellers on the secondary
bond market
.
OIDs and Default Risk
Just like you need to examine a sweater selling for a discount for flaws, the same care must be taken with OID bonds. One that is offering a large OID might be selling at a discount because the bond issuer is in financial distress. Also, a bond selling at a discount might mean there's a lack of investors willing to buy it for some reason. There may be an expectation the company might
default
on the bond. A default is when an issuer can no longer make interest payments or repay the principal amount that bondholders had initially invested.
If corporate bonds default, investors have little recourse. Although bondholders are paid before common stockholders in the event of a company's
bankruptcy,
there is no guarantee that the investor will receive the return of the full amount of their investment, if anything at all.
Although investors are compensated somewhat for their risk by being able to buy the bond at a discounted price, they should weigh the risks versus the rewards carefully.
Advantages and Disadvantages of OID
Original Issue Discount Pros and Cons
Pros
Investors pay less than the par value for an OID bond.
Zero-coupon bonds use large OIDs to entice investors.
Less capital is required to invest
Cons
Discounted bonds can indicate an issuer is facing financial difficulty.
The OID may not offset rates offered by traditional fixed-rate bonds.
Investors could face an annual tax liability before the bond matures.
OIDs and Tax Liability
It's important for investors to contact a tax professional or review the
IRS tax code
before investing in bonds that are considered original issue discounts. Since the OID on a bond is a type of interest and will serve as a source of income when it reaches maturity, the IRS may expect you to pay taxes on that money (the difference between the discounted purchase price and the face value).
Also, keep in mind that even though some OID bonds don’t pay any interest until they reach maturity, investors still may need to declare a portion of the income earned each year they hold the bond.
Each year, an OID bond’s holder receives a
Form 1099-OID
from the issuer of the bond if the interest accrued is $10 or more. The form will show how much the bond has accrued that year: that amount must be reported as income on the tax return. Since taxes are paid each year, OID bond holders don't receive a tax bill for the whole amount when the bond reaches maturity.

Real-World Example of an OID
As an example, in 2019, KushCo Holdings Inc. (KSHB) sold or floated a senior unsecured note for over $21.3 million. This 18-month note was issued as an original issue discount as stated by the company in its press release: ""The Note is being issued at an original issue discount and will not bear additional interest.""
The issue was placed with a private placement firm and was not registered under the U.S. Securities Act and ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oid.asp
Investopedia,How Escrow Protects Parties in Financial Transactions,"Close
Definition
Escrow is a financial arrangement in which a neutral third party holds and manages funds or assets on behalf of two parties involved in a transaction until all contractual obligations are met.
What Is Escrow?
Escrow is a legal concept describing a financial agreement where assets or money are held by a neutral third party on behalf of two other parties that are in the process of completing a transaction.
Escrow accounts are managed by an
escrow agent
. The agent releases the assets or funds only upon the fulfillment of predetermined contractual obligations (or upon receiving appropriate instructions). Money, securities, funds, and other assets can all be held in escrow.
Key Takeaways
Escrow refers to a financial agreement where a neutral third party holds assets or funds before they are transferred from one party in a transaction to another.
The third party holds the funds until both the buyer and the seller have fulfilled their contractual requirements.
Escrow is associated with real estate transactions, but it can apply to any situation where funds pass from one party to another.
Online escrow agreements have been on the rise as a way to offer secure online transactions for expensive items, such as art or jewelry.
Understanding Escrow
Escrow is a financial process used when two parties take part in a transaction where there is uncertainty about the fulfillment of their obligations. Situations that may employ escrow include internet transactions, banking, intellectual property, real estate, mergers and acquisitions, law, and more.
Consider a company that is selling goods internationally. That company requires assurance that it will receive payment when the goods reach their destination. The buyer, for their part, is prepared to pay for the goods only if they arrive in good condition.
The buyer can place the funds in escrow with an agent with instructions to disburse them to the seller once the goods arrive in a suitable state. This way, both parties are protected, and the transaction can proceed.

Types of Escrow
Escrow and Real Estate
Escrow accounts can
apply to real estate transactions
. If there are conditions attached to the sale, such as the passing of an inspection, the buyer and seller may
agree to use escrow
. The buyer would then place their good faith deposit—also called ""earnest money""—into an escrow account held by a third party. A good faith deposit acts as a deposit on the home and demonstrates the buyer's seriousness about buying the home.
In this case, the buyer of the property deposits the payment for the house in an escrow account held by a
third party
. The seller can allow a house inspection to proceed, for example, confident that the funds are on deposit—and the buyer is capable of making the payment. The amount in escrow is then transferred to the seller once all the conditions for the sale are satisfied.
Escrow can also refer to an escrow account that is set up at the time of mortgage closing. In this instance, the escrow account contains future homeowners insurance and property tax payments. Sometimes lenders have this requirement for borrowers; if this is the case, a portion of the borrower's monthly mortgage payment is deposited into the escrow account to cover future payments for homeowners insurance and property taxes.
Borrowers who set up an escrow account for property tax payments and homeowners insurance will have higher monthly payments (versus borrowers whose monthly mortgage payments just cover principal and interest). However, they will not have to worry about paying large sums annually or semiannually because they're already paying portions of them monthly into their escrow account.
Escrow and the Stock Market
Stocks are often issued in escrow. In this case, while the shareholder is the real owner of the stock, the shareholder has limited rights when it comes to the disposal of the stock.
For example, executives who receive stock as a bonus to their compensation often must wait for an escrow period to pass before they can sell the stock. Stock bonuses are often used to attract or retain top executives.
Escrow and Online Sales
Online escrow, like real estate and stock market escrow, protects the buyer and seller from fraud or nonpayment. An online escrow service acts as the third party for online product sales. Buyers send their payments to the escrow service, which holds the money until the product is received.
Once the product is delivered and verified, the online escrow service releases the funds to the seller. Escrow services are best suited for high-value items, such as jewelry or art. Online escrow companies charge a fee for the service.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Escrow
For a fee, escrow can provide an added layer of security for different parties to transactions that involve large amounts of money.
Escrow accounts for mortgages can help protect the borrower and lender from potentially late payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance. These monthly amounts are usually estimated. You can overpay (or underpay) into your escrow account, which may require an adjustment when it comes time for the servicer to make the payments.
Note: Monthly escrow payments require higher monthly payments, as compared to paying just the principal and interest on your mortgage every month.
Pros
Provides protection during transactions, notably for real estate involving sizable amounts of money
Allows for monthly payments toward insurance and taxes (instead of an annual, large lump sum)
Beneficial for both the buyer and seller when big-ticket items are involved
Cons
Higher mortgage payments (if escrow is used for property taxes and homeowners insurance)
Estimates might be incorrect for total taxes due at the end of the year
Online escrow service fees might be higher than those on other payment platforms, such as PayPal
Example of Escrow
Homebuyers often use escrow twice. First, as
earnest money
(also called a good faith deposit) and then, at
closing
. For example, suppose a potential homebuyer finds a house and decides to make an offer. The offer is accepted, and he must put earnest money of $5,000 into escrow.
The money put in escrow shows the seller that the potential homebuyer is seriously interested in buying the property. In return, the seller takes the property off the market and finalizes all repairs. If all the agreed-upon conditions of the sale are met, at the time of the purchase the escrow money is transferred to the seller (and the purchase price is reduced by the amount of the earnest money: in this example, by $5,000).
At the closing, the homebuyer may also be required by the lender to set up an escrow account to pay property taxes and homeowners insurance. As a result, their monthly payments would look like this:
Principal and interest: $1,000
Homeowners insurance: $100
Property taxes: $300
Total monthly mortgage payment:
$1,400
When the annual (or semi-annual) property taxes and homeowners insurance payments are due, the lender makes them using money in the escrow account. An escrow account ensures that these payments are paid on time. If taxes go unpaid, the tax authority could place a lien on the property, which is not in the best interest of the lender. The escrow account reduces this risk.
What Is the Escrow of a House?
There are multiple uses of escrow relating to buying a house. An escrow account may be used for earnest money in an account (called the escrow account) in which money from the potential homebuyer is deposited. Required escrow is generally 1% to 3% of the asking price for a home. The money is required to ensure the buyer is seriously considering the home and has the funds to make the purchase. In return, the seller will usually take the property off the market and allow the potential buyer access to the home for inspections.
How Does Escrow Work?
Escrow required by mortgage lenders involves making monthly payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance into an escrow account held by a third party. If escrow is required by the lender (or requested by the borrower), the monthly payment will include principal and interest for the loan, as well as amounts for property taxes and homeowners insurance. The lender will keep the amounts for taxes and insurance in the escrow account. Then, when the bills come due, they will make the appropriate payments.
What Does Escrow Mean in Mortgage?
Escrow relating to mortgages involves property tax and insurance payments. This escrow account can last for the length of a mortgage loan. Lenders don't always require escrow. However, if you are required to set up an escrow account, many lenders will consider a written request to end escrow after you've made, typically, a year of on-time mortgage payments and your
loan-to-value
is at most 90%—although some lenders may require 80% or lower.
Is Escrow Good or Bad?
Escrow is generally considered good because it protects the buyer and seller in a transaction. In addition, escrow as part of mortgage payments is generally good for the lender and helps the buyer by ensuring property taxes and homeowners insurance are paid on time.
What Is an Escrow Disbursement?
An escrow disbursement is a payment made from an escrow account. With real estate, it's made by the lender on behalf of a borrower to cover property taxes and homeowners insurance.
The Bottom Line
Escrow can be used for various transactions, including real estate, stock issuances, and online sales. Money from the buyer is held in an escrow account until the transaction is complete, or the buyer is able to receive or verify the condition of the product.
Once the buyer approves the transaction, the money is released to",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp

A 10-year U.S. Treasury note is a debt security issued by the U.S. and is a loan made by the investor to the government with a maturity of 10 years from the date it's issued.
What Is a 10-Year Treasury Note?
The 10-year Treasury note is a debt obligation issued by the U.S. government with a maturity of 10 years upon initial issuance. A 10-year Treasury note pays interest at a fixed rate every six months and pays the face value to the holder at maturity. The U.S. government partially funds itself by issuing these notes.
Key Takeaways
Treasury notes (T-notes) have maturities of up to 10 years. These can be appropriate for long-term saving or investing.
You don't necessarily have to hold 10-year T-notes for the entire duration. You can sell them at any time in the secondary market.
The 10-year T-note is the most widely tracked government debt instrument in finance.
T-note prices typically move in the opposite direction from major stock market indexes.
How 10-Year Treasury Notes Work
The U.S. government issues three types of debt securities to fund its obligations:
Treasury bills
, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. Bills, bonds, and notes are distinguished by their length of maturity.
Treasury bills (T-bills) have the shortest lengths of time to maturity—one year or less. The Treasury offers T-bills with maturities of four, eight, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. Treasury notes have maturities ranging from one to 10 years. Bonds are Treasury securities with maturities longer than 10 years.

3
Treasury notes and bonds pay interest at a fixed rate every six months to maturity. They're then redeemed at
par value
. The Treasury repays the principal it borrowed.
T-bills are issued at discounts to par, and they don't have coupon payments. The interest on T-bills is the difference between the face value repaid at maturity and the purchase price.

The 10-Year Note Yield As a Benchmark
The 10-year T-note is the most widely tracked government debt instrument. Its
yield
is frequently used as a benchmark for other interest rates, like mortgage and corporate debt. Commercial interest rates don't follow the 10-year yield, however.
The chart below shows the historical 10-year Treasury yield from March 2022 to April 2025. Since March 2022, the 10-year Treasury yield has seen a general upward trajectory, blotted with fluctuations. The upward trajectory is a result of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates to curb the high
inflation
experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The interest rate set by the Fed increased from a range of 0.25% and 0.50% in March 2022 to a range of 5.25% and 5.50% in July 2023, with rates only starting to slightly come down in September 2024.
4
The yield of the 10-year note went from about 1.7% in March 2022 to a peak of 4.98% in October 2023. As of April 2025, the rate is about 4.4%.
5
The 10-year note is undoubtedly a highly significant benchmark for global financial markets. A rising yield indicates investor confidence in the economy but also suggests higher borrowing costs, potentially slowing economic growth. Conversely, a falling yield may signal economic uncertainty.
What Impacts the 10-Year Treasury Yield?
Several factors influence the 10-year Treasury yield. It's directly affected by investor
confidence
in the markets. When investors are optimistic about the economy's health, they tend to invest in riskier assets, reducing demand for Treasury notes, causing a need to increase their yield.
Conversely, in times of economic uncertainty, investors often flock to the safety of Treasury notes, driving up their prices and lowering them.
Inflation is another major influence, as we have seen more recently. Higher inflation can decrease the real return on Treasury notes, causing yields to rise as investors demand higher returns to offset the erosion of buying power. Conversely, low inflation can lead to lower yields.
Lastly, the yield is also affected by monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. For instance, when the Federal Reserve chooses to raise interest rates, yields on Treasury notes also tend to increase, reflecting the higher cost of borrowing.
The Advantages of Investing in Treasury Notes
Fixed-income securities offer important portfolio
diversification
benefits because their returns aren't correlated with the performance of stocks.
T-Notes Are Safe
: Government debt and the 10-year Treasury note, in particular, are considered among the safest investments. Its price often (but not always)
moves inversely
to the trend of the major stock market indexes. Central banks tend to lower interest rates in a recession, which reduces the coupon rate on new Treasuries. This then makes older Treasury securities with higher coupon rates more desirable.
T-Notes Are Partially Tax-Exempt
: Another advantage of investing in 10-year Treasury notes and other federal government securities is that the coupon payments are exempt from state and local income taxes. They're still taxable at the federal level, however.
6
There's No Minimum Holding Term
: Investors can choose to hold Treasury notes until maturity or sell them early in the secondary market. There's no minimum holding term.
The Disadvantages of Investing in Treasury Notes
Investing in Treasury notes, while considered safe, comes with drawbacks.
Lower Rate of Return
: Treasury notes can yield less than riskier assets like equity investments or higher-yielding corporate bonds. This makes them potentially less profitable for investors than alternatives.
Inflation Risks
: During periods of high inflation, fixed-interest payments from Treasury notes can lose purchasing power. If inflation outpaces the yield, the real return can turn negative. If you are holding longer-running notes, you need to ensure you understand how inflation will affect your investment.
Interest Rate Risk
: An uptick in interest rates could lower the value of existing Treasury notes. This could result in capital losses should you liquidate your holdings before their maturity date.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Investing in Treasury Notes
Advantages
Low risk because of government backing
Easy to buy and sell
Partially free from state and local taxes
Disadvantages
Lower yield compared with other investments
Vulnerability to inflation
Potential capital loss if sold before maturity
How to Buy 10-Year Treasury Bonds
The
U.S. Treasury
sells its notes, bonds, and bills through the TreasuryDirect website. Sales are done through competitive or non-competitive bidding with a minimum purchase of $100, with bidding increasing in $100 increments. Treasury securities can also be bought through a bank or broker.
2
How Are T-Notes Issued?
All T-notes are issued electronically, so investors cannot obtain paper certificates. Series I Savings Bonds are the only Treasury securities still issued on paper, and they can only be bought on paper with tax refund proceeds.
2
7
When Are T-Notes Issued?
The Treasury issues new T-notes of shorter maturities every month. However, new 10-year notes are only issued in February, May, August, and November. The Treasury sells additional 10-year notes from the most recent issue in what is known as ""reopenings"" in other months.
Reopened notes have the same maturity date and coupon interest rate as the original issue, but they have a different issue date and a purchase price that reflects subsequent changes in the market's interest rates.
2
Can I Buy Treasury Bills From My Bank?
Yes, you can purchase Treasury bills from many banks, but you may end up paying additional expenses such as sales commissions and other transaction charges. Over time, these fees and expenses can eat into your returns.
The Bottom Line
A 10-year Treasury note pays interest at a fixed rate twice a year and will pay its face value at maturity. They are issued by the U.S. government and provide low-risk investments, and they're generally tax-exempt at the state and local levels. T-notes can be a good choice for those who prefer not to roll the dice with more iffy investments.

Definition
FANG is an acronym of four technology companies: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.
What Are FANG Stocks?
In finance, the acronym ""FANG"" refers to the stocks of four prominent American
technology companies
: Meta (
META
) (
formerly Facebook
), Amazon (
AMZN
), Netflix (
NFLX
), and Alphabet/Google (
GOOG
). FANG stocks are famous for the impressive growth they have experienced.
In 2017, the company Apple (
AAPL
) was also added by some analysts, resulting in the new acronym ""
FAANG
."" Apple's stock price more than doubled between June 2020 and June 2025.
1
Key Takeaways
The acronym ""FANG"" refers to the stocks of four popular American technology companies: Facebook (Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (Alphabet).
Since 2017, Apple has also been included, making the acronym FAANG.
Each FANG company has shown extraordinary growth, reflected in their revenues and net profits.
Although their business models vary, they each share the use of advanced technologies to acquire and retain users.
Understanding FANG Stocks
The term ""FANG stocks"" was initially coined by
The Street's
Bob Lang and later popularized by Jim Cramer on his CNBC TV show
Mad Money
.
2
It is now widely used by market commentators and analysts. The stocks referred to by the acronym are all well-known and richly valued technology companies that trade on the
Nasdaq
exchange, a collection of approximately 4,000 American companies.
3
Many other companies traded on the Nasdaq exchange are also considered
growth investments
, although very few have matched the impressive growth of the FANG stocks.
Despite their common reputation as successful growth companies, the business models of the FANG stocks are distinct.
Facebook (Meta)
Facebook, for example, is the world's preeminent
social networking
platform. In the company's March 2025 quarterly reporting, Meta claimed it's daily active users for March 2025 was 3.43 billion, up 6% from the year prior.
4
To monetize this extraordinary user base, Facebook sells ads targeted based on users' personal preferences and usage patterns.
Amazon
Amazon, meanwhile, is a leading
business-to-consumer
(B2C) e-commerce platform that uses leading-edge
cloud computing
and
data analytics
technologies to sell a retail catalog. Although Amazon initially pioneered the sale of books online, books now represent much less of its overall product catalog than when it started.
5
Netflix
Netflix is also known for its impressive customer growth. An online entertainment
streaming service
specializing in movies and television shows, the company's subscriber base has grown exponentially, from 26 million in 2011 to 302 million reporting in the company's 2024 annual report.
6
7
To compete with
new entrants
to the streaming market, Netflix also aggressively produces exclusive content, moving beyond its traditional role as a content aggregator to a major content producer in its own right.
Google (Alphabet)
Alphabet has leveraged its core expertise as the world’s foremost search engine, developing a highly profitable online advertising business while driving user retention through popular web applications such as YouTube, Google Docs, and Google Maps.
Fast Fact
There are alternative acronyms for clusters of stocks; for example, FAANG incorporates Apple stock.
FANG Stock Performance
Meta
Over the past decade, Meta Platforms has delivered remarkable long-term returns, with its stock price climbing nearly 700% since mid-2015 and over 1,700% since its 2012 IPO.
8
The company experienced significant volatility: after a sharp drop of -64% in 2022, Meta rebounded with a 194% surge in 2023 and a further 66% gain in 2024. As of June 16, 2025, Meta is up a little more than 17% YTD.
Apple
Apple’s stock has been a consistent long-term winner, rising from under $20 in 2014 to a peak closing price of $258.40 in December 2024—a more than tenfold increase over the decade.
9
The company saw particularly strong gains in 2020 and 2021, with annual returns of 82% and 35% respectively. In 2025, Apple’s shares have faced headwinds, declining about 20% year-to-date as of June 16, 2025 amid a broader concerns about demand and potential tariff implications.
Amazon
Amazon’s stock has delivered extraordinary long-term gains, rising roughly 900% over the past decade. The company’s shares soared during the pandemic, then endured a steep drop in 2022 (-50%) before rebounding 81% in 2023 and 44% in 2024. In 2025, Amazon’s performance has been more muted, with the stock down about 6% year-to-date as of June 2025.
10
Netflix
Netflix has been one of the decade’s standout performers, with its stock up nearly 700% since 2015 and delivering a 185% total return over the past five years. After a major correction in 2022 (-51%), Netflix shares rebounded sharply, gaining 65% in 2023, 83% in 2024. The stock hit all-time highs above $1,262 on June 5th, 2025 (as of June 16, 2025).
11
Google
Alphabet’s stock has appreciated nearly 700% over the past decade, with especially strong years in 2021 (65%) and 2023 (58%). Alphabet hit an all-time high in February 2025 but has since pulled back, though ongoing AI investments, and expansion into autonomous vehicles and global partnerships continue to long-term investor confidence.
12
How to Invest in the FANG Stocks
Since there are only a handful of stocks in the FANG universe, it is relatively easy for investors to trade these names directly with their broker, especially now that many brokers offer zero-commission trading.
As of June 2025, no funds hold only FANG (or FAANG) stocks.
13
Instead, investors looking for ETFs that have heavy weightings of these could look to tech-heavy ETFs such as those that track the Nasdaq 100.
What Does the Acronym FANG Stand for?
The acronym FANG was coined by
The Street's
Bob Lang and popularized by Jim Cramer on his CNBC TV show
Mad Money
.
2
This acronym refers to the stocks of four prominent American technology companies—Meta (
META
) (formerly Facebook), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOG). By adding Apple (AAPL) in 2017, ""FANG"" became ""FAANG.""
Why Are FANG Stocks Popular?
FANG stocks are famous for their impressive growth and popularity, with each member more than doubling its stock price at times. However, despite exhibiting growth stock behavior, FANG stocks are not too volatile. This stability, along with delivering superior rates of return, has made these quite attractive to investors.
What Businesses Are FANGs in?
Although they each share the use of advanced technologies to acquire and retain users, FANGs have distinct business models. Facebook is a prominent worldwide social networking platform. Amazon is a leading
business-to-consumer

Definition
A free market is an economy with minimal or no government control of supply, demand, or prices.
What Is a Free Market?
The free market is an economic system based on supply and demand with little or no government control. One of the central principles of a free market is the concept of voluntary exchange, which is defined as any transaction in which two parties freely trade goods or services.
Free markets are characterized by a spontaneous and decentralized order of arrangements through which individuals make economic decisions.
Key Takeaways
A free market is one where the laws of supply and demand provide the sole basis for the economic system, without government intervention.
A core tenet of free markets is the idea of voluntary exchange, transactions in which buyers and sellers freely trade goods and services.
While no pure free market economies actually exist, and all markets are in some ways constrained, economists who measure the degree of freedom in markets have found a generally positive relationship between free markets and measures of economic well-being.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Free Markets
The term “free market” is sometimes used as a synonym for laissez-faire capitalism. When most people discuss the “free market,” they mean an economy with unobstructed competition and only private transactions between buyers and sellers. However, a more inclusive definition should include any voluntary economic activity so long as it is not controlled by coercive central authorities.
1
Using this description,
laissez-faire
capitalism and voluntary
socialism
are each examples of a free market, even though the latter includes common ownership of the means of production. The critical feature is the absence of coercive impositions or restrictions regarding economic activity.
2
1
Coercion may only take place in a free market by prior mutual agreement in a voluntary contract, such as contractual remedies enforced by tort law.
The Free Market's Connection With Capitalism and Individual Liberty
No modern country operates with completely uninhibited free markets. That said, the most free markets tend to coincide with countries that value private property, capitalism, and individual rights.
1
This makes sense since political systems that shy away from regulations or subsidies for individual behavior necessarily interfere less with voluntary economic transactions. Additionally, free markets are more likely to grow and thrive in a system where property rights are well-protected and capitalists have an incentive to pursue profits.

Free Markets and Financial Markets
In free markets, a financial market can develop to facilitate financing needs for those who cannot or do not want to self-finance. For example, some individuals or businesses specialize in acquiring savings by consistently not consuming all of their present wealth. Others specialize in deploying savings in pursuit of entrepreneurial activity, such as starting or expanding a business. These actors can benefit from trading financial securities such as stocks and bonds.
For example, savers can purchase bonds and trade their present savings to entrepreneurs for the promise of future savings plus remuneration, or interest. With stocks, savings are traded for an ownership claim on future earnings. There are no modern examples of purely free financial markets.
Common Constraints on the Free Market
All constraints on the free market use implicit or explicit threats of force. Common examples include: prohibition of specific exchanges, taxation, regulations, mandates on specific terms within an exchange, licensing requirements, fixed exchange rates, competition from publicly provided services, price controls, and quotas on production, purchases of goods, or employee hiring practices.
Common justifications for politically imposed constraints on free markets include consumer safety, fairness between various advantaged or disadvantaged groups in society, and the provision of public goods. Whatever the outward justification, business firms and other interest groups within society often lobby to shape these constraints in their own favor in a phenomenon known as rent-seeking. When free market behavior is regulated, the scope of the free market is curtailed but usually not eliminated entirely, and voluntary exchanges may still take place within the framework of government regulations.
Measuring Economic Freedom
To study the effects of free markets on the economy, economists have devised several well-known
indexes of economic freedom
. These include the Index of Economic Freedom published by the Heritage Foundation, and the Economic Freedom of the World and Economic Freedom of North America indexes published by the Fraser Institute. These indexes include items such as the security of property rights, the burden of regulation, and the openness of financial markets, and others. Empirical analysis comparing these indexes to various measures of economic growth, development, and standards of living shows overwhelming evidence of a relationship between free markets and material well-being across countries.

What Is a Free Market in Simple Terms?
Free markets are economies where governments do not control prices, supply, or demand or interfere in market activity. Market participants are the ones who ultimately control the market.
Is Free Market the Same as Capitalism?
Capitalism is a form of free market, sharing some similarities, but they are not the same. Governments are involved in regulating private and public businesses and implementing fiscal and monetary policies to influence economic activity.
Is Free Market a Good Thing?
A completely free market is a theoretical environment, with most markets combining aspects of other types. These combination markets tend to allow privacy in ownership and individualism rather than allowing markets to exist without any controls.
The Bottom Line
A free market is one where voluntary exchange and the laws of supply and demand are the basis for the economic system. Crucially, a free market is defined by the absence of government control. While no modern country has a completely free market, those that have relatively free markets tend to value private property, capitalism, and individual liberties.

Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight
Understanding Interpersonal Skills
Interpersonal skills are often referred to as people skills, social skills, or social intelligence. They involve reading the signals that others send and interpreting them accurately in order to form effective responses. Individuals show their interpersonal skills all the time simply by interacting with others.
Everyone has a personal style and an interpersonal style. Some people are more successful than others at using interpersonal skills for specific, desired results. Interpersonal skills may be based in part on
personality
and instinct. However, good ones can also be introduced to people and improved upon.
While interpersonal skills can be developed, they cannot be learned solely from a textbook. For some people, they should be practiced, used daily, observed, and then tweaked. That is to say, these skills may come naturally to certain individuals, but others have to work at cultivating them. This cultivation often happens through continuous interaction with other individuals.
In many organizations, employees with strong interpersonal skills are valued for their pleasant demeanor and positive, solution-oriented attitude.
These employees are seen as team players who work well with others to achieve a goal. In more human terms, everyone likes being around them. That's a welcome attribute in any social interaction, including those involving work.
Interpersonal skills are strongly linked to a knowledge of social expectations and customs, whether that knowledge is inherent or learned. People with the strongest interpersonal skills adjust their tactics and communications as needed, depending on the reactions of others to their messages and meanings.
Those without good interpersonal skills can still
succeed in business
if they are allowed to work in areas that don't require regular interactions with a variety of people. These areas might include research, development, coding, and system testing.
Examples of Interpersonal Skills
The many types of interpersonal skills that can lead to great outcomes at work include:
Clear communication, whether you're explaining an idea or asking a question in person, in writing, or by phone
Attentive, careful listening
Confirming that you comprehend what you've heard from a colleague or customer
Empathetic behavior that shows you understand and care about a colleague's situation
Supporting the useful ideas and honest efforts of colleagues
Responding positively to communications from others
Presenting a willingness to get a job done
Building relationships
Being positive
Benefits of Interpersonal Skills
The importance of solid, properly-used interpersonal skills in the workplace can't be overstated. Their benefits provide advantages for individual employees and companies as a whole. These benefits can include:
Better camaraderie
Increased trust and dependability
More and better creativity through successful collaboration
Effective and efficient task completion
More enthusiasm for a particular task or job
Elimination of unnecessary problems
Greater productivity
Opportunities for greater exposure to different, positive experiences with other employees or clients
Opportunities to display qualities of leadership
Opportunities for promotions
The growth of a reliable professional network that can help build a career
Can Interpersonal Skills Be Learned?
Normally, social or interpersonal skills are learned by taking part in daily group activities, through specific daily actions involving others, and by watching other people succeed or fail in simple interactions.
Everyday life within a family, at school, at church, or on the playing field offers a wealth of opportunities to be introduced to and practice your interpersonal skills. These skills can be picked up naturally and used with sincerity. The best interpersonal skills are never forced, even if they are used with specific purposes in mind. They are a tool for positive results and living, whether at work or within a community or a family.
Important
Strong interpersonal skills are prerequisites for many professional jobs and for a successful career.
Using Interpersonal Skills in the Job Search
Interpersonal skills are highly valued in the business world. Job seekers should use every opportunity to show their interpersonal skills on
resumés
and at
interviews
.
Some of the highly valuable interpersonal skills for business that you can display include:
Active listening
Eliciting and fully processing information from a speaker
Negotiating in sales,
marketing
, law, and customer service
Public speaking
Conflict management
Team building
Collaboration
Showing Interpersonal Skills on a Resumé
On a resumé, a job seeker can highlight the interpersonal skills they have as they relate to the skills sought by the employer. They can underscore those accomplishments that tie directly to important interpersonal skills. For instance, they might highlight an example of teamwork that got a task done to rave reviews, successfully communicating useful ideas to others at a stressful time, or building relationships that underpinned a positive financial outcome.
Showing Interpersonal Skills During an Interview
It can be difficult for an interviewer to gauge a prospective employee's actual ability to perform a particular job in one, potentially short interview. Therefore, candidates should put their interpersonal skills to work during any such opportunity to meet.
Bear in mind that one of the most important interpersonal skills could be simply making a connection with the interviewer. Be friendly, empathetic, understanding, and enthusiastic. Then, look for opportunities in the conversation to drill down to some specifics. For instance:
Note how well you've worked with others to achieve specific goals and that such collaboration would be a priority for you in this new job.
Explain how listening to customers carefully has been a key to success in your sales.
Demonstrate how your patience and clear communications with fellow employees turned a brand new team into a success story.
Sharing your positive interpersonal skill experiences on a resumé and during job interviews in this way can help a company determine how well your skills would fit, not just the job that you've applied for but also, within the larger organization.
Using Interpersonal Skills in the Workplace
Strong interpersonal skills such as negotiating, problem-solving, and knowledge-sharing can be the main requirements for certain jobs. Other interpersonal skills seen as essential for all employees include:
Teamwork
Verbal and written communication (e.g., in-person meetings, emails, phone)
Non-verbal communication (e.g., eye contact, facial expressions, gestures)
Dependability
Responsibility
Empathy
To showcase these skills, try to get involved with colleagues to solve problems. Volunteer to take on tasks that no one else will. Or, be enthusiastic about tasks you're given that you may not enjoy.
Be confident and positive in every dealing with colleagues or managers. Ultimately, being successful with interpersonal skills in the workplace comes down to coming up with and using ideas smartly to build good relationships with others.

Investopedia,What Is Rational Choice Theory?,"Close
Definition
Rational choice theory assumes that individuals make informed decisions instead of random choices.
What Is Rational Choice Theory?
Rational choice theory states that individuals seek to achieve outcomes aligned with their objectives to maximize their
self-interest
. When limited options are available, individuals choose the path that provides the greatest benefit and satisfaction.
Key Takeaways
Adam Smith was one of the first economists to develop the underlying principles of rational choice theory.
Rational choice theory is often associated with the concepts of rational actors and the invisible hand.
Many economists believe that rational choice theory benefits the economy as a whole.
Self-Interest and the Invisible Hand
Adam Smith was one of the first economists to develop the underlying principles of rational choice theory. In his book,
""
An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations
"",
published in 1776,
Adam Smith
introduces the idea of the invisible hand. The
invisible hand
is a metaphor for the unseen forces influencing a free-market economy.
1
The invisible hand theory assumes self-interest. Both this theory and further developments in rational choice theory refute any negative misconceptions associated with self-interest. Instead, these concepts suggest that rational actors acting with their self-interest in mind can create benefits for the economy at large.
Through the freedom of production, as well as consumption, the best interests of society are fulfilled. The constant interplay of individual pressures on market
supply and demand
causes the natural movement of prices and trade. Economists who believe in the invisible hand theory lobby for less government intervention and more free-market exchange opportunities.
2
Collective Behavior
Rational actors are the individuals in an economy who make choices based on calculations and available information. Rational choice theory assumes that individuals, or rational actors, maximize their advantage in any situation and consistently try to minimize their losses. Economists may use this assumption of rationality as part of broader studies to understand certain behaviors of society as a whole. Like all theories, rational choice theory may explain collective behavior.

Rational choice theory also helps to explain behavior that seems irrational. Dissenters have pointed out that individuals do not always make rational, utility-maximizing decisions based on
behavioral economics
, which explains the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions.
Economist Richard Thaler highlighted the limitations of the assumption that humans operate as rational actors. Thaler’s idea of
mental accounting
shows how people place greater value on some dollars than others, even though all dollars have the same value.
3
They might drive to another store to save $10 on a $20 purchase, but they would not drive to another store to save $10 on a $1,000 purchase.
Fast Fact
Rational choice theory can help determine buying patterns, prices, demand, and supply when consumers make purchases based on
utility
or the satisfaction a product or service provides.
Critics of Rational Choice
Critics of rational choice theory say that, in an ideal world, people always make optimal decisions that provide them with the greatest benefit and satisfaction. However, people are often moved by emotions and external factors.
Nobel laureate
Herbert Simon
, who rejected the assumption of perfect rationality in mainstream economics, proposed the theory of bounded rationality instead. This theory says people cannot obtain all the necessary information to make the best possible decision.
Simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives, or all consequences that follow from each alternative, is realistically impossible for most decisions.
4
Pros and Cons
Pros
Helpful in explaining individual and collective behaviors
Individual actions may contribute to the overall economy
Can help to explain behavior that seems irrational
Cons
Individuals do not always make rational decisions
People are often moved by factors such as emotions
Individuals do not have complete access to the information they need to make the most rational decisions
What Are the Main Goals of Rational Choice Theory?
The main goal of rational choice theory is to explain why individuals and larger groups make certain choices, based on specific costs and rewards. According to rational choice theory, individuals use their self-interest to make choices that provide the greatest benefit. People weigh their options and make the choice they think will serve them best.
What Is Rational Choice Theory in International Relations?
States, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and multinational corporations are all made up of human beings. Rational choice theory helps to explain how leaders and other important decision-makers of organizations and institutions make decisions. Rational choice theory can also attempt to predict the future actions of these actors.
What Are the Strengths of Rational Choice Theory?
One of the strengths of rational choice theory is the versatility of its application. It can be applied to many different disciplines and areas of study. It also makes reasonable assumptions and compelling logic. The theory also encourages individuals to make sound economic decisions. By making sound economic decisions, an individual can acquire more tools that will allow them to further maximize their preferences in the future.
The Bottom Line
Rational choice theory surmises that individuals make choices that result in optimal utility. People would rather take actions that benefit them vs. actions that are neutral or harm them.

A general ledger stores and organizes the data that are itemized in a firm’s financial statements.
What Is a General Ledger?
A general ledger represents the record-keeping system for a company’s financial data, with debit and credit account records validated by a trial balance. It provides a record of each financial transaction that takes place during the life of an operating company and holds account information that is needed to prepare the company’s financial statements. Transaction data is segregated by type into accounts for assets, liabilities, owners’ equity, revenues, and expenses.
Key Takeaways
A general ledger is the foundation of a company’s double-entry accounting system.
General ledger accounts encompass transaction data needed to produce an income statement, balance sheet, and other financial reports.
General ledger transactions summarize transactions made as journal entries to sub-ledger accounts.
The trial balance is a report that lists every general ledger account and its balance, making adjustments easier to check and errors easier to locate.
Investopedia / Eliana Rodgers
How a General Ledger Works
A general ledger is the foundation of a
system employed by accountants
to store and organize financial data used to create the firm’s financial statements. Transactions are posted to individual sub-ledger accounts as defined by the company’s
chart of accounts
.
The transactions are then closed out or summarized in the general ledger, and the accountant generates a trial balance. This balance serves as
a report of each ledger account’s balance
. The trial balance is checked for errors and adjusted by posting additional necessary entries, and then the adjusted trial balance is used to generate the financial statements.
How a General Ledger Functions With Double-Entry Accounting
A general ledger is used by businesses that employ the
double-entry
bookkeeping method, which means that each financial transaction affects at least two sub-ledger accounts, and each entry has at least one debit and one credit transaction. Double-entry transactions, called journal entries, are posted in two columns, with debit entries on the left and credit entries on the right, and the
total of all debit and credit entries
must balance.
1
The
accounting equation
, which underlies double-entry accounting, is as follows:
Assets
−
Liabilities
=
Stockholders’ Equity
\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Stockholders' Equity}
Assets
−
Liabilities
=
Stockholders’ Equity
The
balance sheet
follows this format and shows information at a detailed account level. For example, the balance sheet shows several asset accounts, including cash and accounts receivable, in its short-term assets section.
The double-entry accounting method works based on the accounting equation’s requirement that transactions posted to the accounts on the left of the equal sign in the formula must equal the total of transactions posted to the account (or accounts) on the right.
Even if the equation is presented differently (such as Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity),
the balancing rule always applies
.
The table below is a simple example of what a double-entry general ledger may look like.

What Does a General Ledger Tell You?
The transaction details contained in the general ledger are compiled and summarized at various levels to produce a trial balance,
income statement
, balance sheet,
statement of cash flows
, and other financial reports. This helps accountants, company management, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders assess the company’s performance on an ongoing basis.
Financial statement data often doesn’t tell the whole story When expenses spike in a given period or a company records other transactions that affect key financial
metrics
(revenues,
net income
, etc.) That's why it becomes important to go back to the general ledger and dig into the details of each recorded transaction to locate the issue. At times, this can involve reviewing dozens of journal entries, but it is imperative to maintain reliably error-free and credible company financial statements.
Tip
Investors who want to make sure that a company's accounting and financial reporting is accurate should review supporting documents in addition to its financial statements along with any footnotes in these statements.
A Balance Sheet Transaction Example
If a company receives payment from a client for a $200 invoice, the accountant increases the cash account with a $200 debit and completes the entry with a credit, or reduction, of $200 to
accounts receivable (AR).
The posted debit and credit amounts are equal.
In this instance, one asset account (cash) is increased by $200, while another asset account (AR) is reduced by $200. The net result is that both the increase and the decrease only affect one side of the accounting equation. Thus, the equation remains in balance.
An Income Statement Transaction Example
The income statement follows its own formula, which works as follows. When a company receives payment from a client for the sale of a product, the cash received is tabulated in
net sales
along with the receipts from other sales and returns. The
cost of sales
is subtracted from that sum to yield the
gross profit
for that reporting period.
The income statement will also account for other expenses, such as
selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses
, depreciation,
interest
, and
income taxes
. The difference between these inflows and outflows is the company's net income for the reporting period.
What Is the Purpose of a General Ledger?
In accounting, a general ledger is used to
record a company’s ongoing transactions
. Within a general ledger, transactional data is organized into assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and owner’s equity. After each sub-ledger has been closed out, the accountant prepares the trial balance. This data from the trial balance is then used to create the company’s financial statements, such as its balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and other financial reports.
Is a General Ledger Part of the Double-Entry Bookkeeping Method?
Yes, a company that uses a double-entry bookkeeping method uses the general ledger method of storing company financial data. Specifically, double-entry bookkeeping is when each transaction impacts at least one debit and one credit transaction. In other words, each transaction appears in two columns, a debit column and a credit column, whose totals must balance. Under this balancing rule, the following equation applies:
Assets - Liabilities = Stockholders’ Equity.
What Is an Example of a General Ledger Entry?
Consider the following example where a company receives a $1,000 payment from a client for its services. The accountant would then increase the asset column by $1,000 and subtract $1,000 from accounts receivable. The equation remains
in balance
, as the equivalent increase and decrease affect one side—the asset side—of the accounting equation.
The Bottom Line
A general ledger is an accounting tool that companies use to organize and maintain their financial records. It is the basis for corporate financial statements and ensures that financial reporting is done accurately and transparently. Companies can use their general ledgers to make better decisions about their finances while giving investors and analysts insight into their financial health and well-being.

Investopedia,What Is Diversification? Definition As an Investing Strategy,"Close
Definition
Diversification is the strategy of investing in different asset classes and asset types to reduce portfolio risk associated with price volatility.
What Is Diversification?
Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to
limit exposure to any single asset or risk
.
The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.
Key Takeaways
Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk.
Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency and then in different types of securities within a class.
Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments.
The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of assets.
Investors can diversify on their own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds.
Understanding Diversification
Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness.
Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the
negative performance
of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly
correlated
—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.
Diversification Strategies
As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.

Asset Classes
Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. Classes can include:
Stocks
: Shares or equity in a publicly traded company
Bonds
: Government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments
Real estate
: Land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
: A marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector
Commodities
: Basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services
Cash and short-term cash-equivalents (CCE)
: Treasury bills, certificate of deposit (CD), money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments
The theory holds that what may negatively impact one asset class may benefit another. For example, rising interest rates usually negatively impact bond prices as yield must increase to make fixed income securities more attractive. On the other hand, rising interest rates may result in increases in rent for real estate or increases in prices for commodities.

Industries/Sectors
There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk.
For example, consider the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.
1
This legislation impacts many industries, though some companies are more affected than others.
Semiconductor
manufacturers will be largely impacted, while the financial services sector might feel smaller, residual impacts.
Investors can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. For example, consider two major means of entertainment: travel and digital streaming. Investors hoping to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts may invest in digital streaming platforms (positively impacted by more shutdowns). At the same time, they may consider simultaneously investing in airlines (positively impacted by fewer shutdowns). In theory, these two unrelated industries may minimize overall portfolio risk.
Important
How many stocks do you need to own to be properly diversified? A study published in the
Journal of Risk and Financial Management
found there are simply too many variables to consider, and ""an optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist.""
2
Corporate Lifecycle Stages (Growth vs. Value)
Public equities tend to be broken into two categories:
growth stocks
and
value stocks
. Growth stocks are stocks in companies that are expected to experience profit or revenue growth greater than the industry average. Value stocks are stocks in companies that appear to be trading at a discount based on the current fundamentals of a company.
Growth stocks tend to be more risky as the expected growth of a company may not materialize. For example, if the Federal Reserve constricts monetary policy, less capital is usually available (or it is more expensive to borrow), creating a more difficult scenario for growth companies. However, growth companies may tap into seemingly limitless potential and exceed expectations, generating even greater returns than expected.
On the other hand, value stocks tend to be more established, stable companies. While these companies may have already experienced most of their potential, they usually carry less risk. By diversifying into both, an investor would capitalize on the future potential of some companies while also recognizing the existing benefits of others.
Market Capitalizations (Large vs. Small)
Investors may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlying
market capitalization
of the asset or company. Consider the vast operational differences between Apple and Newell Brands Inc. In July 2023, both companies were in the S&P 500, with Apple representing 7.6% of the index and Newell Brands representing 0.0065%.
3
Each company will have a considerably different approach to raising capital, introducing new products to the market, brand recognition, and growth potential. Lower cap stocks have more room to grow, though higher cap stocks tend to be safer investments.
Risk Profiles
Across almost every asset class, investors can choose the underlying risk profile of the security. For example, consider fixed-income securities. An investor can choose to buy bonds from the top-rated governments in the world or from nearly defunct private companies raising
emergency funds
. There are considerable differences between several 10-year bonds based on the issuer, their credit rating, future operational outlook, and existing level of debt.
The same can be said for other types of investments. Real estate development projects with more risk may carry greater upside than established operating properties. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies with longer histories and greater adoption, such as Bitcoin, carry less risk relative to smaller market cap coins or tokens.
Tip
Diversification may not be the best strategy for investors wanting to maximize their returns. Consider ""YOLO"" (you only live once) strategies where 100% of capital is placed in a high-risk investment. Though there is a higher probability of making life-changing money, there is also the highest probability of losing it due to poor diversification.
Maturity Lengths
Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact risk profiles. Generally, the longer the
maturity
, the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bond's prices due to changes in interest rates. Short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates; however, they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. Investors more comfortable with risk may consider adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest.
Maturity length is also prevalent in other asset classes. Consider the difference between short-term lease agreements for residential properties (i.e., up to one year) and long-term lease agreements for commercial properties (i.e., sometimes five years or greater). Though there is more security in collecting rent revenue by locking into a long-term agreement, investors sacrifice flexibility to increase prices or change tenants.
Physical Locations (Foreign vs. Domestic)
Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn.
Alternatively, there may be a greater potential upside (with associated higher degrees of risk) when diversifying across developed and emerging countries. Consider Pakistan's current classification as a
frontier market
participant (recently downgraded from an emerging market participant).
4
Investors willing to take on higher levels of risk may want to consider the higher growth potential of smaller yet-to-be-fully established markets such as Pakistan.

What Is a Straddle?
A straddle is a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying (long position) both a put option (leg one) and a call option (leg two) for the underlying security with the same
strike price
and the same
expiration date
.
A trader will profit from a long straddle when the price of the security rises or falls from the strike price by an amount more than the total cost of the
premium
paid. The profit potential is virtually unlimited on the call leg as long as the price of the underlying security moves very sharply. The profit on the put leg is capped at the difference between the strike price and zero less the premium paid.
Key Takeaways
A straddle is an options strategy that involves the purchase of both a put and a call option.
Both options are purchased at the same expiration date and strike price on the same underlying securities.
The strategy is only profitable when the stock either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total premium paid.
A straddle implies what the expected volatility and trading range of a security may be by the expiration date.
This strategy is most effective when considering heavily volatile investments. The premiums paid on multiple options may easily outweigh any potential profit without strong price movement.
Zoe Hansen / Investopedia
Understanding Straddles
Straddle strategies in finance refer to
two separate transactions
that both involve the same underlying security with the two corresponding transactions offsetting each other. Investors tend to employ a straddle when they anticipate a significant move in a stock’s price but they're unsure about whether the price will move up or down.
Julie Bang / Investopedia
A straddle can give a trader two significant clues about what the options market thinks of a stock. First is the
volatility
that the market is expecting from the security. Second is the expected trading range of the stock by the expiration date.
How to Create a Straddle
A trader must add the price of the
put
and the call together to determine the cost of creating a straddle. They could create a straddle if they believe that a stock may rise or fall from its current price of $55 following the release of its latest earnings report on March 1. The trader would look to purchase one put and one call at the $55 strike with an expiration date of March 15.
Take the Next Step to Invest

The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
The trader would add the price of one March 15 $55
call
and one March 15 $55 put to determine the cost of creating the straddle. The total outlay or premium paid would be $5.00 for the two contracts x 100 = $500 (one contract consists of 100 shares) if both the calls and the puts trade for $2.50 each.
The premium paid suggests that the stock would have to rise or fall by 9% from the $55 strike price to earn a profit by March 15. The amount that the stock is expected to rise or fall is a measure of its future expected volatility. Divide the premium paid by the strike price ($5 divided by $55, or 9%) to determine how much the stock has to rise or fall.
Discovering the Predicted Trading Range
Options prices imply a predicted trading range. A trader can add or subtract the price of the straddle to or from the price of the stock to determine its expected trading range. The $5 premium could be added to $55 to predict a trading range of $50 to $60 in this case.
The trader would lose some of their money but not necessarily all of it if the stock traded within the zone of $50 to $60. It's only possible to earn a profit if the stock rises or falls outside of the $50 to $60 zone at the time of expiration.
Earning a Profit
The calls would be worth $0 and the puts would be worth $7 at expiration if the stock fell to $48. This would deliver a profit of $2 to the trader. But the calls would be worth $2 if the stock went to $57 and the puts would be worth zero, giving the trader a loss of $3.
Important
The worst-case scenario is when the stock price stays at or near the strike price.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Straddle Positions
Advantages
Straddle options are entered into for the potential income to the upside or downside. Consider a stock that's trading at $300. You pay $10 premiums for call and put options at a strike price of $300. You may capitalize on the call if the equity swings to the upside. You may capitalize on the put if the equity swings to the downside. In either case, the straddle option may yield a profit whether the stock price rises or falls.
Straddle strategies are often used leading up to major company events such as quarterly reports. Investors may elect to opt into offsetting positions to mitigate risk when they aren’t sure how the news will break. This allows traders to set up positions in advance of major swings to the upside or downside.
Disadvantages
The movement of the equity’s price must be greater than the premium(s) paid for a straddle position to be profitable. You paid $20 in premiums ($10 for the call, $10 for the put) in the example above. Your net position yields you at a loss if the stock’s price only moves from $300 to $315. Straddle positions often result in profit only when there are large, material swings in equity prices.
Another downside is the guaranteed loss regarding premiums. One option is guaranteed to not be used depending on which way the stock price breaks. This can be especially true for equities that have little to no price movement, yielding both options as unusable or unprofitable. This “loss” is incurred in addition to potentially higher transaction costs due to opening more positions compared to a one-sided trade.
Straddle positions are most suitable for periods of heavy volatility so they can’t be used during all market conditions. They're not successful during stable market periods. Straddle positions also work better for certain investments. Not all investment opportunities may benefit from this position, especially those with a low
beta
.
Straddle Strategy Positions
Pros
The strategy has the potential to earn income regardless of whether the underlying security increases or decreases in price.
The strategy may be useful when major news is anticipated but it's uncertain in which direction markets will take events.
Investors may mitigate potential losses or downsides by hedging their investment rather than entering just a single-direction trade.
Cons
The underlying security must be volatile. Straddle positions are often unprofitable without substantial price movement.
The investor is certain to purchase an option and pay a premium for a contract it will never execute.
The strategy isn't suitable in all market conditions or for all types of securities because it relies on volatility.
Example of a Straddle
Activity in the options market on June 18 implied that the stock price for Company XYZ, an American motor parts manufacturer, could rise or fall 20% from the $26 strike price for expiration on July 16 because it cost $5.10 to buy one put and call.
It placed the stock in a trading range of $20.90 to $31.15. The company reported results and shares plunged from $22.70 to $19.27 a week later on June 25.
The trader would have earned a profit in this case because the stock fell outside the range, exceeding the premium cost of buying the puts and calls.
What Is a Long Straddle?
A
long straddle
is an options strategy that an investor makes when they anticipate that a particular stock will soon be undergoing volatility. The investor believes the stock will make a significant move outside the trading range but is uncertain whether the stock price will head higher or lower.
The investor simultaneously buys an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put with the same expiration date and the same strike price to execute a long straddle. The investor in many long-straddle scenarios believes that an upcoming news event such as an earnings report or acquisition announcement will push the underlying stock from low volatility to high volatility.
The objective of the investor is to profit from a large move in price. A small price movement will generally not be enough for an investor to make a profit from a long straddle.
1
How Do You Earn a Profit in a Straddle?
Divide the total premium cost by the strike price to determine how much an
underlying security
must rise or fall to earn a profit on a straddle. It would be calculated as $10 divided by $100 or 10% if the total premium cost was $10 and the strike price was $100. The security must rise or fall more than 10% from the $100 strike price to make a profit.
What Is an Example of a Straddle?
Consider a trader who expects a company’s shares to experience sharp price fluctuations following an interest rate announcement on Jan. 15. The stock’s price is currently $100. The investor creates a straddle by purchasing both a $5 put option and a $5 call option at a $100 strike price that expires on Jan. 30.

A government bond is a debt security issued by a government to support government spending and obligations.
What Is a Government Bond?
A government bond is a debt security issued by a government to support spending and obligations. Government bonds pay bondholders periodic interest payments called
coupon payments
.
Government bonds
issued and backed by national governments are often considered low-risk investments. Government bonds issued by a federal government are also known as
sovereign debt.
Key Takeaways
A government bond represents debt issued by a government and sold to investors to support spending.
Government bonds are considered low-risk investments since the government backs them.
Because of their relatively low risk, government bonds typically pay low interest rates.
Investopedia / NoNo Flores
Types of Government Bonds
Municipal Bonds:
Local governments issue
municipal bonds
to fund infrastructure, libraries, or parks. These ""munis"" often carry tax advantages and exemptions for investors.
1
Munis may be supported by local tax dollars or revenue from a project like a toll road.
2
Municipal bonds commonly provide investors with lower interest rates than riskier investments like
corporate bonds
or stocks.
U.S. Savings Bonds:
The U.S. Treasury offers series
EE bonds
and series I savings bonds. Bonds sell at face value and have a fixed rate of interest. Bonds held for 20 years will reach their face value and effectively double. Series I bonds receive a semi-annually calculated secondary rate tied to an inflation rate.
3
Treasury Bills (T-Bills):
Short-term securities from four weeks to 52 weeks. Bills are sold at a discount or face value. When the bill matures, investors are paid its face value.
4
Treasury Notes (T-Notes):
Intermediate-term bonds maturing in two, three, five, or 10 years that provide fixed coupon returns.
Treasury notes (T-notes)
typically have a $1,000 face value. However, two- or three-year maturities have a $5,000 face value.
5
Treasury bonds (T-Bonds):
Long-term bonds with a maturity between 20 to 30 years.
Treasury bonds (T-Bonds)
give interest or coupon payments semi-annually and have a minimum investment of $100.
6
The bonds help to offset shortfalls in the federal budget. Also, they help to regulate the nation's money supply and execute U.S.
monetary policy
.
Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS):
Indexed to inflation,
Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)
protect investors from the adverse effects of rising prices. The par value, or principal, increases with inflation and decreases with deflation, following the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
. These securities with maturities of five, 10, or 30 years, pay a fixed rate of interest determined on the bond's auction on a six-month basis.
7
Bond Terms
Face
or Par Value
: the amount of debt bondholders loan the government and the amount they will get back when the bond matures
Coupon
: the regular interest payments credited to bondholders
Yield
: the interest rate on the bond after accounting for its market price
Market Price:
the price of the bond in the secondary market, which may differ from the face value
Treasuries
: U.S. federal government bonds
How To Buy Bonds
Investors who
buy government bonds
and hold them until maturity enjoy regular interest payments and a return on their initial investment. The price of a government bond will fluctuate in the market. Bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates⁠—so when interest rates go up, government bond prices go down in the secondary market.

Warning
Fixed-rate government bonds have
interest rate risk
when interest rates rise and investors hold lower-paying fixed-rate bonds. If a fixed-rate
government bond
pays 2% per year and prices rise 1.5%, the investor earns only 0.5% in real terms.
Foreign Government Bonds
U.S. Treasuries are regarded as nearly
risk-free
investments, however, those floated by other countries may carry a greater degree of risk.
11
Due to this risk-free nature, market participants and analysts use Treasuries as a benchmark in comparing the risk associated with securities. The 10-year Treasury bond is also used as a benchmark and guide for interest rates on lending products.
Other government-backed bonds, particularly those in
emerging markets
, carry regional, political, and central bank risks. Investors saw a bleak reminder of how risky some government bonds can be during the
Asian financial crisis
of 1997 and 1998.
12
During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency, which sent reverberations around the globe.
Pros and Cons of Government Bonds
Government bonds provide both benefits and disadvantages to the bondholder. These debt securities tend to return a steady stream of interest income. However, this return is usually lower than other products on the market due to the low level of risk.
The market for U.S. government bonds is very liquid, allowing the holder to resell them on the secondary bond market easily. Some ETFs and
mutual funds
focus their investment on Treasury bonds.
Fixed-rate bonds may fall behind during increasing inflation or rising market interest rates. Also, foreign bonds are exposed to sovereign or governmental risk, and changes in currency rates, and have a higher risk of default.
Pros
Low risk of default for U.S. bonds
A liquid market for reselling
Assessable through mutual funds and ETFs
Cons
Offer low rates of return
Carry risk when market interest rates increase
Default and other risks on foreign bonds
How Do Investors Buy Government Bonds?
U.S. Treasury securities are available to investors through their broker, bank, or the
TreasuryDirect
website. Investors can also look to ETFs or mutual funds that invest in Treasuries. Municipal bonds are available from a broker.
How Does the U.S. National Debt Relate to Bonds?
In the U.S., the
national debt
refers largely to the notional value of outstanding government bonds. The largest portion of the national debt, approximately $28.2 trillion, is publicly held. Intragovernmental holdings make up nearly $7.1 trillion, for a total debt of around $35.3 trillion as of Q3 2024.
13
How Does the Federal Reserve Use Bonds for Monetary Policy?
Government bonds help fund deficits in the federal budget and are used to raise capital for various projects such as infrastructure spending. However, government bonds are also used by the Federal Reserve Bank to
control the nation's money supply
. When the
Federal Reserve
repurchases U.S. government bonds, the money supply increases as sellers receive funds to spend or invest in the market. Any funds deposited into banks are used to loan money to companies and individuals, further boosting economic activity.
What Are Example of Non-U.S. Government Bonds?
Foreign governments issue debt in the form of bonds. Some of these commonly include U.K.
Gilts
, German
Bunds
, French OATs, and Japanese
JGBs
.
The Bottom Line
Government bonds carry a risk-free rate of return but come with lower yields. In the U.S., federal bonds are known as Treasuries. Foreign governments also issue bonds. State and local governments issue municipal bonds that may offer certain tax exemptions.

What Is the Russell 2000 Index?
The Russell 2000 Index is a stock market index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smaller companies included in the
Russell 3000 Index
. The Russell 2000 is managed by London's
FTSE Russell Group
, widely regarded as a
bellwether
of the U.S. economy because of its focus on smaller companies in the U.S. market.
Key Takeaways
The Russell 2000 index is a market index composed of 2,000 small-cap companies.
The index was launched in 1984 by the Frank Russell Company and is now managed by FTSE Russell.
The index is frequently used as a benchmark for measuring the performance of small-cap mutual funds.
Many investors see the index's breadth as giving it an edge over narrower indexes of small-cap stocks.
Investors can replicate the returns of the Russell 2000 Index by investing in a fund that tracks the index.
Understanding the Russell 2000 Index
The Russell 2000 Index was launched in 1984 by the Frank Russell Company. It is a U.S. index managed by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the
London Stock Exchange (LSE)
Group. The index is composed of about 2,000 small-cap companies.

Mutual fund
investors favor the Russell 2000 Index because it reflects the investment opportunity presented by the entire
market
rather than opportunities offered by narrower indices, which may contain bias or more stock-specific risk that can distort a fund manager's performance. It's no surprise that many funds and
exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
mirror or are based on the Russell 2000.
Important
Many investors compare
small-cap
mutual funds' movements against the index's movement. That's because the index's movement is seen as a reflection of the opportunities in that entire sub-section of the market rather than narrower indices, which may contain biases or more stock-specific risks that can distort performance.
Key Metrics of the Russell 2000 Index
As of March 31, 2024, the average
value
for a company on the Russell 2000 was $4.82 billion, while the median market cap was $960 million. The largest stock by market cap on the index was $58.43 billion.
1
The Russell 2000 first traded above 1,000 on May 20, 2013.
3
Two sub-indexes of the Russell 2000 have been created to track the performance of companies within it that contain unique characteristics that are desired by certain types of investors:
The
Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of Russell 2000 companies with higher price-to-value ratios and higher forecasted growth values.
4
The Russell 2000 Value Index measures the performance of Russell 2000 companies with lower
price-to-book (P/B) ratios
and lower forecasted growth values.
5
Fast Fact
The smallest 1,000 companies in the Russell 2000 make up the Russell
1000 Microcap Index
.
6
The Russell 2000 is itself composed of the two-thousand smallest companies in the broader Russell 3000 Index.
4
Special Considerations
The Russell 2000 Index is weighted using a combination of market cap and the other indexes a stock is listed on. This means that a member stock's last sale price, the number of shares that can be traded, and whether it is on other indexes influence its listing on the index.
The other big difference between the Russell 2000 and other major indices is that it tracks small-cap stocks. The S&P 500 and
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
indices, on the other hand, track large-cap stocks.
The index's returns can be replicated by investors who take the trouble to create a sizeable and complex
portfolio
that mirrors the index. However, there are far easier ways to get the same returns. For instance, investors can use index futures or
index-based mutual funds
that track the Russell 2000. The most popular option is an ETF. The most heavily traded of the ETFs is the iShares Russell 2000 index ETF (
IWM
).
What Does the Russell 2000 Indicate?
The Russell 2000 Index is a measure of the performance of 2,000 publicly traded small-cap U.S. companies.
What Is the Russell 2000 Methodology?
The Russell 2000 weighs U.S. small capitalization stocks using a float-adjusted market capitalization approach.
What's the Highest the Russel 2000 Has Ever Been?
The Russell 2000 reached a high of 2,458 on Nov. 7, 2021.
7
The Bottom Line
The Russell 2000 is an index of 2,000 small-cap companies that was first launched in 1984. It is widely used as a benchmark for U.S. small-cap stocks. The index comprises 2,000 of the smallest companies in the Russell 3000, which itself covers roughly 98% of the stocks publicly traded in the U.S.

The Russell 2000 is rebalanced every June, and companies are added, deleted, or kept.

What Is Unlimited Liability?
Unlimited liability refers to the full legal responsibility that business owners and partners assume for all business debts. This
liability
isn't capped and obligations can be paid through the seizure and sale of the owners’ personal assets without the protection that the popular limited liability business structure provides.
Key Takeaways
An unlimited liability company includes general partnerships and sole proprietors who are equally responsible for all debt and liabilities accrued by the business.
Most companies opt to form limited partnerships in which a partner's liability can't exceed their investment in the company.
Nondisclosure is a benefit of forming a foreign unlimited liability subsidiary for many companies.
Understanding Unlimited Liability
Unlimited liability typically exists in
general partnerships
and
sole proprietorships
. It provides that each business owner is equally responsible for whatever debt accrued within a business if the company is unable to repay or defaults on its debt. An owner's personal wealth can be seized to cover the balance owed.
Fast Fact
Most companies opt to form limited partnerships or limited liability companies instead where one or more business partners are only liable up to the amount of money they've invested in the company.
1
An Example of Unlimited Liability
Consider four individuals who are working as partners. Each invests $35,000 into the new business that they own jointly. The company accrues $225,000 in liabilities over one year. All four partners are equally liable for repayment of the $225,000 if the company can't repay and/or defaults on these debts. The owners would be required to come up with $56,250 each to alleviate the $225,000 in debt, in addition to their initial investment of $35,000.
Unlimited Liability Laws Worldwide
Unlimited liability companies are typically found in jurisdictions where company law stems from English law. Unlimited liability companies are incorporated or formed through registration under the Companies Act of 2006 in the United Kingdom.
2
Fast Fact
Other areas where these companies are formed under English law include Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, India, and Pakistan.
Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and two jurisdictions in Canada are also areas where unlimited liability companies are commonly formed, but they're referred to as
unlimited liability corporations
in Canada.
Despite the number of companies and countries in which they exist, unlimited companies are an uncommon form of company incorporation due to the burden placed on owners to cover a company's debt, specifically when the company faces liquidation.
One of the benefits of forming an unlimited liability subsidiary may be nondisclosure. Etsy, an online crafts marketplace, created an Irish subsidiary in 2015 that's classified as an unlimited liability company. Public reports on money that the company moves through Ireland or tax payment amounts are therefore no longer required.
3
Joint Stock vs. Unlimited Liability
A
joint-stock company (JSC
) is similar to an unlimited liability company in the U.S. because shareholders have unlimited liability for company debts. JSCs operate under associations in New York and in Texas under the Texas Joint-Stock Company/Revocable Living Trust model, as well as in other states.
4
5
This model has some basic differences from a general partnership, including a lack of limited liability for shareholders, formation through a private contract that creates a separate entity, and the fact that one shareholder can't bind another shareholder regarding liability because each is equally responsible.
What Is a Sole Proprietorship?
A single individual has complete control over a sole proprietorship. All business assets are the proprietor's personal assets, and the individual is 100% responsible for business debts and liabilities. This business structure is most suited to low-risk enterprises.
1
What Is a Corporation?
A corporation is owned by its stockholders who are completely protected from the business's liabilities. Forming a corporation requires filing articles of incorporation with the state in which the business is located. A small business corporation (S-corporation) is similar but tax obligations pass through from the corporation to the owners who must report their share of the business's income and losses on their personal returns.
6
What Is a Disregarded Entity?
""Disregarded entity"" is a tax term. Like an S-corporation, a limited liability business structure allows income and losses to pass down to its owners' personal tax returns. The business structure itself is ""disregarded"" by the IRS for tax purposes.
7
The Bottom Line
Each business owner is equally responsible for any and all debts that accrue within an unlimited liability business structure. Their personal assets are at risk if the business is unable to repay or defaults on its debt. This type of structure is typically suitable for small businesses with limited assets and debts.
Consult with a
financial advisor
or attorney in your state if you're considering forming and operating this type of business entity.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tracks thirty of America's biggest and most established companies, acting like a quick temperature check of the U.S. economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. The Dow Jones is named after Charles Dow, who created the index in 1896 with his business partner, Edward Jones. Also referred to as the Dow 30, the index is considered a gauge of the broader U.S. economy.
1
Key Takeaways
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a widely-watched benchmark index in the U.S. for blue chip stocks.
The DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.
The index was created by Charles Dow in 1896 to serve as a proxy for the broader U.S. economy.
2
The DJIA's composition can change over time based on economic trends.
The Dow Divisor is a constant created to address the simple average issue.
Investopedia / NoNo Flores
Understanding the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
The DJIA is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. The DJIA was designed to serve as a proxy for the health of the broader U.S. economy. Often referred to simply as the Dow, it is one of the most-watched stock market indexes in the world. While the Dow includes a range of companies, all can be described as
blue chip
companies with consistently stable earnings.
3
In the early 20th century, the performance of industrial companies was typically tied to the overall growth rate in the economy. That cemented the relationship between the Dow's performance and the overall economy. Even today, for many investors, a strong-performing Dow equals a strong economy, while a weak-performing Dow generally means a slowing economy.
2
As the economy changes over time, so does the index's composition. A part of the Dow may be dropped when a company becomes less relevant to current trends of the economy, to be replaced by a new name that better reflects the shift. For instance, a company may be removed from the index when its
market capitalization
drops because of financial distress.

Stocks with higher share prices are given greater weight in the index. So, a higher percentage move in a higher-priced component will have a greater impact on the final calculated value. At the Dow's inception, Charles Dow calculated the average by adding the prices of the 12 Dow component stocks and dividing by 12. The result was a simple average. Over time, additions and subtractions to the index had to be accounted for, such as mergers and stock splits. At that point, a simple mean calculation no longer made sense.
4
The Dow Divisor and Index Calculation
The
Dow divisor
was created to address the simple average issue. The divisor is a predetermined constant that is used to determine the effect of a one-point move in any of the about 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. There have been instances when the divisor needed to be changed so that the value of the Dow stayed consistent. As of 2024, the Dow Divisor was 0.15265312230608.
5
The Dow is not calculated using a weighted arithmetic average and doesn't represent its component companies' market cap, unlike the S&P 500. Rather, it reflects the sum of the price of one share of stock for all the components, divided by the divisor. Thus, a one-point move in any of the component stocks will move the index by an identical number of points.
5
DJIA Price = SUM (Component Stock Prices) ÷ Dow Divisor
Important
The S&P 500 has outperformed the DJIA on an annualized basis over the last three-, five-, and 10-year periods.
3
6
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index Components
The DJIA launched in 1896 with just 12 companies, primarily in the industrial sector. They included railroads, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil. The index grew to 30 components by 1928. Since then, it's changed many times—the very first came three months after the 30-component index launched. The first large-scale change was in 1932 when eight stocks in the Dow were replaced.
7
8
1
The Dow is reevaluated regularly. Companies are replaced when they no longer meet the index's listing criteria with those that do. Over time, the index became a
bellwether
of the U.S. economy, reflecting economic changes. For example, U.S. Steel was removed from the index in 1991 and replaced by building material company Martin Marietta.
9
DJIA Index Component Changes
As the index is reevaluated, major changes to the DJIA can occur over time:
In 1997, Westinghouse Electric, Bethlehem Steel, Texaco, and Woolworths were replaced by Travelers' Group, Johnson & Johnson (
JNJ
), HP Inc. (
HPQ
), and Walmart Inc. (
WMT
).
7
In 1999, Chevron Corp. (
CVX
), Sears Roebuck, Union Carbide, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (
GT
) were dropped, while Home Depot Inc. (
HD
), Intel Corporation (
INTC
), Microsoft Corporation (
MSFT
), and SBC Communications were added in their place.
7
Walgreens Boots Alliance (
WBA
) replaced General Electric (later split into different companies) in June 2018.
In August 2020, Salesforce (
CRM
), Amgen Inc. (
AMGN
), and Honeywell International (
HON
) were added to the Dow, replacing ExxonMobil (
XOM
), Pfizer Inc. (
PFE
), and defense and aerospace contractor Raytheon Technologies (
RTN
). Raytheon had joined the DJIA earlier that year after United Technologies (UTX) merged with Raytheon.
10
11
12
In 2024, several additional changes were made to the index composition. Amazon.com Inc. (
AMZN
) replaced Walgreens in February 2024 after Walmart's stock split, which reduced its weight on the index.
13
In November 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (
NVDA
) was added, replacing Intel. This change reflected NVIDIA's remarkable growth in the semiconductor sector, particularly driven by its advances in
artificial intelligence
technology. Sherwin-Williams (
SHW
) also joined the index, replacing Dow Inc. (
DOW
). Sherwin-Williams is well-known for its extensive range of paint and coatings and has shown strong performance in the market, significantly outperforming Dow, which has struggled since its split from DowDuPont.
14
These latest changes mark just the 53rd adjustment to the DJIA since its inception in 1896 and highlight a shift toward companies that are more relevant in their respective industries.
Historical Milestones

Investopedia,"11th District Cost of Funds Index: What It is, How It Works","Close
What Is the 11th District Cost of Funds Index?
The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) was a monthly index that reflected the average interest rate paid by savings institutions in Arizona, California, and Nevada on checking and savings accounts. It was one of many indices used by mortgage lenders to adjust the interest rate on
adjustable rate mortgages
(ARM) and was launched in 1981. With an ARM mortgage, the interest rate on a mortgage moves up and down along with some standard interest rate chosen by the lender, and COFI was one of the most popular indices in the western states.
Published on the last day of each month, the COFI represented the
cost of funds
for Western savings institutions that were members of
Federal Home Loan Bank
of San Francisco, a self-regulatory agency, and satisfied the Bank's criteria for inclusion in the index. The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco stopped publishing the COFI on Jan. 31, 2022. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (
Freddie Mac
) created a replacement index called the Enterprise 11th District COFI Replacement Index.
Understanding the 11th District COFI
The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) was computed using several different factors, with interest paid on savings accounts comprising the largest weighting in the average. As a result, the index tended to have low volatility and follow market interest rate changes somewhat slowly; it was generally regarded as a two-month lagging indicator of market interest rates. The interest rate on a mortgage would not match the COFI, rather the ARM rate that was typically 2% to 3% higher than COFI, depending on the borrower's credit history, the size and terms of the loan, the ability of the borrower to negotiate with the bank, and many other factors.
Because was computed using data from three western states, the COFI was primarily used in the western U.S., while the 1-year Treasury index was the measure of choice in the eastern region.

Cost of Goods Sold refers to the direct costs associated with producing the goods that a company sells while excluding indirect expenses like distribution and sales costs.
What Is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?
Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.
Cost of goods sold is also referred to as ""cost of sales.""
Key Takeaways
Cost of goods sold (COGS) includes all of the costs and expenses directly related to the production of goods.
COGS excludes indirect costs such as overhead and sales and marketing.
COGS is deducted from revenues (sales) in order to calculate gross profit and gross margin. Higher COGS results in lower margins.
The value of COGS will change depending on the accounting standards used in the calculation.
COGS differs from operating expenses (OPEX) in that OPEX includes expenditures that are not directly tied to the production of goods or services.

Why Is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Important?
COGS is an important metric on financial statements as it is subtracted from a company’s revenues to determine its
gross profit
. Gross profit is a profitability measure that evaluates how efficient a company is in managing its labor and supplies in the production process.
Because COGS is a
cost of doing business
, it is recorded as a business expense on income statements. Knowing the cost of goods sold helps analysts, investors, and managers estimate a company’s bottom line. If COGS increases, net income will decrease. While this movement is beneficial for income tax purposes, the business will have less profit for its shareholders. Businesses thus try to keep their COGS low so that net profits will be higher.

What Is Included in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)?
Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the
cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products
or finished goods that a company then sells during a period, so the only costs included in the measure are those that are directly tied to the production of the products, including the
cost of labor
, materials, and manufacturing overhead.

For example, COGS for an automaker would include
the material costs
for the parts that go into making the car plus the labor costs used to put the car together. The cost of sending the cars to dealerships and the cost of the labor used to sell the car would be excluded.
Furthermore, costs incurred on the cars that were not sold during the year will not be included when calculating COGS, whether the costs are direct or indirect. In other words, COGS includes the direct cost of producing goods or services that were purchased by customers during the year. As a rule of thumb, if you want to know if an expense falls under COGS, ask: ""Would this expense have been an expense even if no sales were generated?""
Important
COGS only applies to those costs directly related to producing goods intended for sale.

​
Inventory that is sold appears in the
income statement
under the COGS account.
The beginning inventory for the year is the inventory left over from the previous year—that is, the
merchandise
that was not sold in the previous year.
Any additional productions or purchases made by a manufacturing or retail company are added to the beginning inventory. At the end of the year, the products that were not sold are subtracted from the sum of beginning inventory and additional purchases. The final number derived from the calculation is the cost of goods sold for the year.
The balance sheet has an account called the current assets account. Under this account is an item called inventory. The balance sheet only captures a company’s
financial health
at the end of an accounting period. This means that the inventory value recorded under current assets is the ending inventory.
What Are Different Accounting Methods For COGS?
The value of the cost of goods sold depends on the inventory valuation method adopted by a company. There are three methods that a company can use when recording the level of inventory sold during a period:
first in, first out (FIFO)
, last in, first out (LIFO), and the average cost method. The special identification method is used for high-ticket or unique items.
3
FIFO Method
The earliest goods to be purchased or manufactured are sold first. Since prices tend to go up over time, a company that uses the
FIFO
method will sell its least expensive products first, which translates to a lower COGS than the COGS recorded under LIFO. Hence, the
net income
using the FIFO method increases over time.
LIFO Method
LIFO
is where the latest goods added to the inventory are sold first. During periods of rising prices, goods with higher costs are sold first, leading to a higher COGS amount. Over time, the net income tends to decrease.
Average Cost Method
The average price of all the goods in stock, regardless of purchase date, is used to value the goods sold. Taking the
average product cost
over a time period has a smoothing effect that prevents COGS from being highly impacted by the extreme costs of one or more acquisitions or purchases.
Special Identification Method
The special identification method uses the specific cost of each unit of merchandise (also called inventory or goods) to calculate the ending inventory and COGS for each period. In this method, a business knows precisely which item was sold and
the exact cost
. Further, this method is typically used in industries that sell unique items like cars, real estate, and rare and precious jewels.
What Type of Companies Are Excluded From a COGS Deduction?
Many service companies do not have any cost of goods sold at all. COGS is not addressed in any detail in
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
, but COGS is defined as only the cost of inventory items sold during a given period. Not only do service companies have no goods to sell, but purely service companies also do not have inventories. If COGS is not listed on a company's income statement, no deduction can be applied for those costs.
1
Examples of pure service companies include accounting firms, law offices, real estate appraisers, business consultants, and professional dancers, among others. Even though all of these industries have business expenses and normally spend money to provide their services, they do not list COGS. Instead, they have what is called ""cost of services,"" which does not count towards a COGS deduction.
Cost of Revenue vs. COGS
Costs of revenue
exist for ongoing contract services that can include raw materials, direct labor, shipping costs, and commissions paid to sales employees. These items cannot be claimed as COGS without a physically produced product to sell, however. The IRS website even lists some examples of ""personal service businesses"" that do not calculate COGS on their income statements. These include doctors, lawyers, carpenters, and painters.
4
Many service-based companies have some products to sell. For example, airlines and hotels are primarily providers of services such as transport and lodging, respectively, yet they also sell gifts, food, beverages, and other items. These items are definitely considered goods, and these companies certainly have inventories of such goods. Both of these industries can list COGS on their income statements and claim them for tax purposes.
Operating Expenses vs. COGS
Both
operating
expenses and cost of goods sold (COGS) are expenditures that companies incur with running their business; however, the expenses are segregated on the income statement. Unlike COGS,
operating expenses (OPEX)
are expenditures that are not directly tied to the production of goods or services.

What Is the Velocity of Money?
The velocity of money is the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. It is commonly measured by the number of times that a unit of currency moves from one entity to another within a given period of time. Simply put, it's the rate at which consumers and businesses in an economy collectively spend money.
The velocity of money is usually measured as a ratio of
gross domestic product
(GDP) to a country's M1 or M2
money supply
. The word velocity is used here to reference the speed at which money changes hands.
Key Takeaways
Velocity of money is a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy.
The velocity of money is typically higher in expanding economies and lower in contracting economies.
To calculate velocity of money, economists divide GDP by money supply.
Understanding the Velocity of Money
The velocity of money is important for measuring the rate at which money in circulation is being used for purchasing goods and services. It is used to help economists and investors gauge the health and vitality of an economy. High money velocity is usually associated with a healthy, expanding economy. Low money velocity is usually associated with recessions and contractions.
Economists use the velocity of money to measure the rate at which money is used for goods and services in an economy. While it is not necessarily a key economic indicator, it can be followed alongside other key indicators that help determine economic health like GDP, unemployment, and inflation.
GDP and the money supply
are the two components of the velocity of money formula.
Economies
that exhibit a higher velocity of money relative to others tend to be more developed. The velocity of money is also known to fluctuate with business cycles. When an economy is in an expansion, consumers and businesses tend to more readily spend money causing the velocity of money to increase. When an economy is contracting, consumers and businesses are usually more reluctant to spend and the velocity of money is lower.

Since the velocity of money is typically correlated with business cycles, it can also be correlated with key indicators. Therefore, the velocity of money will usually rise with
GDP and inflation
. Alternatively, it is usually expected to fall when key economic indicators like GDP and inflation are falling in a contracting economy.
Example of Velocity of Money
Consider an economy consisting of two individuals, A and B, who each have $100 of money in cash. Individual A buys a car from individual B for $100. Now B has $200 in cash money. Then B purchases a home from A for $100 and B enlists A's help in adding new construction to their home and for their efforts, B pays A another $100. Individual A now has $200 in cash. Individual B then sells another car to A for $100 and both A and B end up with $100 in cash. Thus, both parties in the economy have made transactions worth $400, even though they only possessed $100 each.
In this economy, the velocity of money would be two, resulting from the $400 in transactions divided by the $200 in money supply. This multiplication in the value of goods and services exchanged is made possible through the velocity of money in an economy.
The Velocity of Money Formula
While the above provides a simplified example of the velocity of money, the velocity of money is used on a much larger scale as a measure of transactional activity for an entire country’s population. In general, this measure can be thought of as the turnover of the money supply for an entire economy.
For this application, economists typically use GDP and either
M1
or
M2
for the money supply. Therefore, the velocity of money equation is written as GDP divided by money supply.
Velocity of Money
=
GDP
Money Supply
\text{Velocity of Money} = \frac{ \text{GDP} }{ \text{Money Supply} }
Velocity of Money
=
Money Supply
GDP
​
GDP is usually used as the numerator in the velocity of money formula though gross national product (GNP) may also be used as well. GDP represents the total amount of goods and services in an economy that are available for purchase. In the denominator, economists will typically identify money velocity for both M1 and M2.
M1 is defined by the Federal Reserve as the sum of all currency held by the public and
transaction deposits
at depository institutions. M2 is a broader measure of money supply, adding in savings deposits, time deposits, and real money market mutual funds.
1
As well, the St. Louis Federal Reserve tracks the quarterly velocity of money using both M1 and M2.
2
Velocity of Money and the Economy
There are differing views among economists as to whether the velocity of money is a useful indicator of the health of an economy or, more specifically, inflationary pressures. The ""monetarists"" who subscribe to the
quantity theory of money
argue that money velocity should be stable absent changing expectations, but a change in money supply can alter expectations and therefore money velocity and inflation.
For example, an increase in the money supply should theoretically lead to a commensurate increase in prices because there is more money chasing the same level of goods and services in the economy. The opposite should happen with a decrease in money supply. Critics, on the other hand, argue that in the
short term
, the velocity of money is highly variable, and prices are resistant to change, resulting in a weak and indirect link between money supply and inflation.
Empirically, data suggests that the velocity of money is indeed variable. Moreover, the relationship between money velocity and inflation is also variable. For example, from 1959 through the end of 2007, the velocity of M2 money stock averaged approximately 1.9x with a maximum of 2.198x in 1997 and a minimum of 1.653x in 1964.
3
Beginning in 2007, the velocity of money fell dramatically as the Federal Reserve greatly expanded its balance sheet in an effort to combat the
global financial crisis
and deflationary pressures.
Money velocity appeared to have bottomed out at 1.435 in the second quarter of 2017 and was gradually rising until the global recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic spurred massive U.S. Federal economic stimulus. At the end of the second quarter of 2020, the M2V was 1.128, the lowest reading of M2 money velocity in history.
3
After another dip in the third quarter of 2021, the M2V has been increasing slowly.
Factors Affecting the Velocity of Money
There are several factors that can affect the velocity of money in an economy. These include:
Money supply:
the velocity of money is inversely related to the supply of money. When the supply of money is increased by the central bank, the pace of economic transactions also increases. This can potentially lead to inflation.
Consumer behavior:
velocity is also affected by the behavior of economic actors. When consumers prioritize saving rather than spending, the pace of transactions slows and the velocity of money declines. When consumers prioritize spending, the velocity of money speeds up.
Payment systems:
The velocity of money is also affected by features of the monetary system, such as the availability of credit or electronic banking. When there are few barriers to transactions, the velocity of money tends to increase; when it is difficult to spend money, it decreases.
Why Is the Velocity of Money Slowing Down?
The velocity of the M1 money supply has steadily decreased since the recession of 2008, according to figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
4
Much of that decline has been attributed to demographic changes and the effects of the Great Recession. With baby boomers approaching retirement and household wealth greatly reduced, many consumers were more incentivized towards saving than before.
Federal regulations may have also played a role, as the
Dodd-Frank Act
increased the reserve requirements and leverage ratios for banks. Because these institutions were required to keep more of their assets, rather than lend or spend them, there was less money to move in the economy.
One factor in the slowing velocity of money is not a mystery: the COVID-19 pandemic. The velocity of money fell sharply in 2020, likely due to the increased economic uncertainty comb",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp

Financial statements that include vertical analysis show line item percentages in a separate column.
What Is Vertical Analysis?
Vertical analysis of a cash flow statement shows each cash inflow or outflow as a percentage of the total cash inflows. Line items on an income statement can be stated as a percentage of
gross sales
. Line items on a balance sheet can be stated as a percentage of total assets or total liabilities.
Key Takeaways
In financial statement analysis, vertical analysis looks at the contributing percentage of each line item to the base figure.
Vertical analysis makes it easier to understand the correlation between single items on a balance sheet and the bottom line, expressed in a percentage.
Vertical analysis can become a more potent tool when used in conjunction with horizontal analysis, which considers the finances of a certain period of time.
Vertical analysis can make it easier to perform a few comparisons.
Michela Buttignol / Investopedia
How Vertical Analysis Works
Vertical analysis makes it much easier to compare the
financial statements
of one company with another and across industries. This is because one can see the relative proportions of account balances.
It also makes it easier to compare previous periods for time series analysis, in which quarterly and annual figures are compared over a number of years, in order to gain a picture of whether performance metrics are improving or deteriorating.
For example, by showing the various expense line items in the
income statement
as a percentage of sales, one can see how these are contributing to
profit margins
and whether profitability is improving over time. It thus becomes easier to compare the profitability of a company with its peers.
Financial statements that include vertical analysis clearly show line item percentages in a separate column. These types of financial statements, including detailed vertical analysis, are also known as
common-size financial statements
and are used by many companies to provide greater detail on a company’s financial position.

Common-size financial statements often incorporate comparative financial statements that include columns comparing each line item to a previously reported period.
Important
Vertical analysis is used to gain a picture of whether performance metrics are improving or deteriorating.
Vertical vs. Horizontal Analysis
Another form of financial statement analysis used in ratio analysis is
horizontal analysis
or
trend analysis
. This is where ratios or line items in a company’s financial statements are compared over a certain period of time by choosing one year’s worth of entries as a baseline, while every other year represents percentage differences in terms of changes to that baseline.
For example, the amount of cash reported on the
balance sheet
on Dec. 31 of 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020 will be expressed as a percentage of the Dec. 31, 2020, amount. Instead of dollar amounts, you might see 141, 135, 126, 118, and 100.
This shows that the amount of cash at the end of 2024 is 141% of the amount it was at the end of 2020. By doing the same analysis for each item on the balance sheet and income statement, one can see how each item has changed in relation to the other items.
Example of Vertical Analysis
For example, suppose XYZ Corporation has gross sales of $5 million,
cost of goods sold
of $1 million,
general and administrative expenses
of $2 million, and a 25% tax rate. Its income statement will look like this if vertical analysis is used:
Sales
$5,000,000
100%
Cost of goods sold
$1,000,000
20%
Gross profit
$4,000,000
80%
General and administrative expenses
$2,000,000
40%
Operating income
$2,000,000
40%
Taxes (%25)
$500,000
10%
Net income
$1,500,000
30%
What Is the Difference Between Horizontal Analysis and Vertical Analysis?
Horizontal analysis, also known as trend analysis, compares historical data on a financial statement over different accounting periods. There is a baseline period, and numbers from succeeding periods are calculated as a percentage of the base period. Vertical analysis looks at numbers in financial statements in the same period and calculates each line item as a percentage of the base figure in that section.
Horizontal analysis indicates long-term trends and highlights areas of strength and those that need improvement. Vertical analysis indicates the relative importance of each line item in a certain period.
What Is an Example of Vertical Analysis?
A company sold 40,000 units of products, 14,000 of which were sneakers and 26,000 of which were boxing gloves. Vertical analysis would show that sneakers made up 35% of sales (14,000 / 40,000) and boxing gloves made up 65% of sales (26,000 / 40,000).
What Are the Pros and Cons of Vertical Analysis?
One of the pros of vertical analysis is that it allows for the comparison of financial statements from one accounting period to the next as well as for comparisons among different companies. One of its cons is that it doesn’t take into consideration absolute numbers, so if you are comparing two companies, looking at percentages will give a different result than absolute numbers.
The Bottom Line
Vertical analysis looks at the contributing percentage of each line item to the total base figure. It can provide information on which metrics are improving and which are worsening. It can be used to compare different components of companies and the same company in different time periods.

Definition
The United Nations is an organization that strives to maintain peace and security among its member nations by promoting social progress and human rights.
What Is the United Nations (UN)?
The United Nations (UN) is an international
nonprofit organization
that aims to increase political and economic cooperation among its member countries. There are more than 190 member states in the UN—all of which are part of the UN's General Assembly.
1
Headquartered in New York, the organization is guided by a charter and headed by its secretary-general. It focuses on peace, security, human rights, and other issues. The UN is part of the larger United Nations System.
Key Takeaways
The United Nations is an international governing body formed to increase political and economic cooperation among its member countries.
The UN grew out of the League of Nations after World War II with nearly every country now participating as a member nation.
It has five principal components, including the UN Economic and Social Council.
Understanding the United Nations (UN)
The United Nations was formed in 1945 in the wake of World War II to reduce international tension, promote human rights, and lower the chance of other large-scale conflicts. It came out of the League of Nations, which was established after WWI in 1920 to promote
international relations
and cooperation. The league could not prevent the war in Europe and Asia in the 1930s. The U.S. wasn't part of the League of Nations.
2
3
Headquartered in New York and led by the Secretary-General, the UN has 193 member states, representing almost every country in the world. There are five permanent U.N. members: the U.S., Russia, France, the U.K., and China. When a new state applies to join the UN, it only takes one permanent member to veto the application.
4
A few states lack UN membership, though countries exercise de facto sovereignty. In some cases, the international community doesn't recognize non-members as independent, such as Tibet, Somaliland, and Abkhazia.
5
Some countries were blocked from being admitted (
Taiwan
and Kosovo among others) by more powerful member states.

Peace and security
Human rights
Humanitarian aid
Sustainable development and climate
International law
Global issues
Important
The United Nations Charter, which is the founding document of the organization, was signed on June 26, 1945, and went into effect on Oct. 24, 1945. It was amended three times between 1963, 1965, and 1973.

Structure of the United Nations (UN)
The UN is made up of five principal bodies: the UN General Assembly, the UN Secretariat, the International Court of Justice, the UN Security Council, and the UN Economic and Social Council. A sixth, the UN Trusteeship Council, has been inactive since 1994.
10
UN General Assembly
This is the UN's main deliberative body, in which all members have equal representation. It is headquartered in New York City, and its responsibilities include setting the UN's
budget
, appointing rotating members to the Security Council, and passing non-binding resolutions that express the opinions of the international community.
11
UN Secretariat
The UN Secretariat is the executive wing of the UN, charged with implementing policies set by its deliberative bodies. Its head, the Secretary-General, is the UN's top official. The Secretariat, which is based in New York City, includes the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which dispatches UN soldiers (known as blue helmets) on missions authorized by the Security Council.
12
International Court of Justice
The International Court of Justice is based in The Hague and has two main functions: to settle disputes submitted by member states according to international law and to issue advisory opinions on legal questions submitted by UN agencies. There are 15 judges, and the court's official languages are French and English. Appeals are not allowed, making the judgments final.
13
Fast Fact
The UN's secretary-general is António Guterres. The secretary-general acts as a diplomat, advocate, civil servant, and
chief executive officer (CEO)
. Guterres assumed the role in 2017 and was sworn in for a second term in 2022.
14
15
UN Security Council
The UN Security Council is charged with maintaining international security. It authorizes peacekeeping missions, accepts new U.N. members, and approves changes to the UN charter.
16
The Security Council's structure allows a few powerful member states to dominate the UN: Russia, the U.K., France, China, and the U.S. hold permanent seats on the council and enjoy veto power.
The Security Council's other 10 seats rotate on a staggered two-year schedule. These seats are occupied by Algeria (2025), Denmark (2026), Greece (2026), Guyana (2025), Pakistan (2026), Panama (2026), Republic of Korea (2025), Sierra Leone (2025), Slovenia (2025), Somalia (2026). The years in parentheses indicate the end of their terms on the council.

Which Countries Are Not Members of the United Nations?
There are 193 sovereign member nations of the UN. A special category allows so-called observer states to participate in General Assembly meetings, but they cannot vote. The two observer states are the Holy See and Palestine. The Holy See was granted the status of a permanent observer in 1964. Palestine officially applied to join the U.N. in 2011, but the UN. Security Council has not voted on the application. In 2012, the State of Palestine was officially recognized as a non-member state. Certain other states, including Kosovo and the Republic of China, or Taiwan, are not members because they're not recognized by all UN members.
19
Who Founded the United Nations?
In April 1945, as World War II was coming to a close, representatives of 50 war-weary countries gathered in San Francisco for the UN Conference on International Organization. For two months, the group worked on drafting and then signing the UN Charter, creating the United Nations, an international organization that all hoped would help prevent another world war. The charter was ratified by China, France, the Soviet Union, the U.K., the U.S., and other nations, and the UN got off the ground officially on October 24, 1945.
3
Who Is the Secretary-General of the UN?
The ninth secretary-general of the U.N., António Guterres, took office on Jan. 1, 2017. The Portugal native took the oath for his second five-year term, which began in January 2022.
15
What Are the Agencies Inside the United Nations?
The U.N. has specialized agencies that are autonomous organizations working inside the United Nations. Some pre-date World War I, while others were associated with the League of Nations or arose when the U.N. was created or even later.
Some of the best-known of these agencies, which are headquartered all over the world, include the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Organization, the World Bank, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.

The Bottom Line
The UN is one of the most recognized nonprofit organizations in the world. Established in 1945, the UN has almost 200 member states. Its focus is to promote peace and security, human rights, and humanitarian aid. Operating under the UN System, the UN has five principal bodies. The organization is led by the secretary-general, who acts as a diplomat and an advocate for member states.

Investopedia,Xenocurrency,"Close
What Is a Xenocurrency?
The term xenocurrency refers to any currency that is traded in markets outside of its domestic borders. Its name derives from the Greek prefix ""xeno,"" meaning ""foreign.""
Today, the use of the term xenocurrency is infrequent as the prefix xeno can have negative connotations in modern English. Xenophobia, for example, means an irrational fear of or hatred toward foreigners. Foreign currency, therefore, has become the preferred term for referring to non-domestic currencies.
Key Takeaways
A xenocurrency is a currency deposited or exchanged in a market outside its country of origin.
Today, the term “eurocurrency” or “foreign currency” is more frequently used.
These types of currency transactions have become increasingly common, driven by the globalization of supply chains and financial markets.
How Xenocurrencies Work
The term xenocurrency was developed in 1974 by the Austrian-American economist Fritz Machlup, who served as President of the International Economic Association from 1971 to 1974.
1
2
Machlup used the phrase to refer to deposits and loans denominated in currencies other than that of the bank’s home country.
Xenocurrency investments can be risky, since they are complicated by many factors, including currency fluctuations and conversion risks. Risks come when
deposits
are in a rising domestic currency market, where the foreign investment may result in lower returns when converting the funds back into the home currency. However, the opposite is valid for investments in declining domestic currency. Collectively, these risks are known as
foreign currency effects
.
Political risks
can also be a factor. During a crisis, a country's government might place restrictions on the amount of xenocurrency that travelers may take out of the country. For instance, after the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018,
3
the Iranian rial plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar.
4
Real World Example of a Xenocurrency
Examples of xenocurrencies include the
Indian rupee (INR)
traded in the United States or the
Japanese yen (JPY)
deposited into a European bank. The
U.S. Dollar (USD)
is likewise often used as xenocurrency in Mexico, especially for large transactions in real estate and other business activities.
Today, the term xenocurrency is frequently used synonymously with
euro currency
. Similarly, the phrase xeno-market is often used interchangeably with the term
eurocurrency-market
. Eurocurrency-market refers to a money market that trades in xenocurrency. Banks, multinational corporations, mutual funds, and hedge funds use the eurocurrency market. These entities use the market because they wish to circumvent regulatory requirements, tax laws and interest rate caps often present in domestic banking, particularly in the United States.

What Is Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB)?
Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a method of budgeting in which all
expenses
must be justified for each new period. The process begins from a “zero base” and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. The budgets are then built around what's needed for the upcoming period regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the last one.
Key Takeaways
Zero-based budgeting is a technique used by companies but this type of budgeting can be used by individuals and families as well.
Budgets are created around the monetary needs for each upcoming period such as a month or a year.
Traditional budgeting and zero-based budgeting are two methods used to track expenditures.
Zero-based budgeting helps managers lower costs for a company.
Mira Norian / Investopedia
How Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Works
ZBB allows top-level strategic goals to be implemented into the budgeting process by tying them to specific functional areas of the organization. Costs can then be first grouped and then measured against previous results and current expectations.
Zero-based budgeting can be a rolling process done over several years with a few functional areas reviewed by managers or group leaders at a time because of its detail-oriented nature. It can help lower costs by avoiding blanket increases or decreases to a prior period’s budget but it's a time-consuming process that takes much longer than traditional, cost-based budgeting.
1
Important
The practice favors areas that achieve direct revenues or production because their contributions are more easily justifiable than in departments such as client service and
research and development
.
Zero-based budgeting is primarily used in business but it can be used by individuals and families, too.
Zero-Based Budgeting vs. Traditional Budgeting
Traditional budgeting calls for incremental increases over previous budgets such as a 2% increase in spending. Zero-based budgeting requires a justification of both old and new expenses.

Traditional budgeting also only analyzes new expenditures.
ZBB starts from zero
and calls for a justification of old, recurring expenses in addition to new expenditures. Zero-based budgeting aims to put the onus on managers to justify expenses. It drives value for an organization by
optimizing
costs, not just revenue.
Example of Zero-Based Budgeting
Suppose a construction equipment company implements a zero-based budgeting process calling for closer scrutiny of manufacturing department expenses. The company notices that the cost of certain parts used in its final products and outsourced to another manufacturer increases by 5% every year.
The company can manufacture those parts in-house using its workers. It finds after weighing the positives and negatives of in-house manufacturing that it can make the parts cheaper than the outside supplier.
The company can identify a situation in which it can decide to make the part itself or buy the part from the external supplier for its end products instead of blindly increasing the budget by a certain percentage and masking the cost increase,
Traditional budgeting may not allow
cost drivers
within departments to be identified but zero-based budgeting is a more granular process that aims to identify and justify expenditures. Zero-based budgeting is also more involved, however, so the costs of the process itself must be weighed against the savings it might identify.
What Is Zero-Based Budgeting?
Zero-based budgeting was created in the late 1960s by former Texas Instruments account manager Peter Pyhrr.
2
Zero-based budgeting starts at zero, unlike traditional budgeting. It justifies each expense for a reporting period.
Zero-based budgeting starts from scratch, analyzing each granular need of the company instead of using the incremental budgeting increases found in traditional budgeting. This essentially allows for a strategic, top-down approach to analyze the performance of a given project.
What Are the Advantages of Zero-Based Budgeting?
Zero-based budgeting offers several advantages, including focused operations, lower costs, budget flexibility, and strategic execution. The highest revenue-generating operations come into greater focus when managers think about how each dollar is spent. Lowered costs may result because zero-based budgeting may prevent the misallocation of resources that can happen over time when a budget grows incrementally.
What Are the Disadvantages of Zero-Based Budgeting?
Zero-based budgeting has several disadvantages. It's time- and resource-intensive. The time cost involved may not be worthwhile because a new budget is developed each period. Using a modified budget template instead may prove more beneficial.
3
ZBB may reward short-term perspectives in the company by allocating more resources to operations with the highest revenues. Areas such as research and development or those that have a long-term horizon, may be overlooked as a result.
The Bottom Line
Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) justifies all expenses for each new period. The process begins from a “zero base,” analyzing every function within an organization for its needs and costs. Budgets are then built around what's needed for the upcoming period regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the one before.

Quality management can enhance customer satisfaction with a business’s products and services through solid oversight of all associated and necessary tasks and activities.
What Is Quality Management?
Quality management is the act of overseeing all activities and tasks that must be accomplished to maintain a desired level of excellence. This includes the determination of a quality policy, creating and implementing quality planning and assurance, and quality control and quality improvement. It is also referred to as
total quality management (TQM)
.
In general, quality management focuses on long-term goals through the implementation of short-term initiatives.

Understanding Quality Management
At its core, TQM is a business philosophy that champions the idea that the long-term success of a company comes from customer satisfaction and loyalty. TQM requires that all stakeholders in a business work together to improve processes, products, services, and the culture of the company itself.
While TQM seems like an intuitive process, it came about as a revolutionary idea. The 1920s saw the rise in reliance on
statistics
and statistical theory in business, and the first-ever known control chart was made in 1924. People began to build on theories of statistics and ended up collectively creating the method of statistical process control (SPC). However, it wasn’t successfully implemented in a business setting until the 1950s.
1
It was during this time that Japan was faced with a harsh industrial economic environment. Its citizens were thought to be largely illiterate, and its products were known to be of low quality. Key businesses in Japan saw these deficiencies and looked to make a change. Relying on pioneers in statistical thinking, companies such as
Toyota
integrated the idea of quality management and quality control into their production processes.
By the end of the 1960s, Japan had completely flipped its narrative and became known as one of the most efficient
export
countries, with some of the most admired products. Effective quality management resulted in better products that could be produced at a cheaper price.
Real-World Example of Quality Management
The most famous example of TQM is Toyota’s implementation of the
kanban
system. A kanban is a physical signal that creates a chain reaction, resulting in a specific action. Toyota used this idea to implement its
just-in-time (JIT) inventory
process. To make its assembly line more efficient, the company decided to keep just enough inventory on hand to fill customer orders as they were generated.
Therefore, all parts of Toyota’s assembly line are assigned a physical card that has an associated inventory number. Right before a part is installed in a car, the card is removed and moved up the
supply chain
, effectively requesting another of the same part. This allows the company to keep its
inventory
lean and not overstock unnecessary assets.

Definition
Profit refers to a company's surplus revenue after accounting for its costs and expenses during a certain period, such as a quarter or fiscal year.
What Is Profit?
A profit occurs when a company's revenue exceeds its expenses. Put simply it's what a business gets to keep after paying for everything it takes to make or sell its products or services. There are different types of profit. Gross profit is what a business earns after deducting all of its costs of goods sold (COGS). Operating profit is the money it earns from its day-to-day activities and excludes interest and taxes. Net profit is what's left over after paying all of its costs. A highly profitable company is better poised to manage its costs and financial obligations. Companies often share their profits with their shareholders or reinvest them into the business.
Key Takeaways
Profit refers to the money companies keep after paying all of their expenses.
Gross profit equals sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Operating profit accounts for expenses like overhead and depreciation.
Net profit is also referred to as the bottom line.
Companies can distribute profits to shareholders as dividends or reinvest them back into the business.
Companies can sell a lot, but may not realize a profit if they can't manage their costs.
Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin
How Profit Is Calculated
Profit is the money a business pulls in after accounting for all expenses. Whether it's a lemonade stand or a publicly-traded multinational company, the primary goal of any business is to earn money.
Some analysts look at top-line profitability, whereas others are interested in profitability before taxes and other expenses. Still others are only concerned with profitability after all costs have been paid.
The three major types of profit are gross profit, operating profit, and net profit, found on a company's
income statement
. Each profit type provides analysts with more information about a company's performance compared to competitors.
Fast Fact
The word “profit” comes from the Latin noun
profectus
, meaning “progress,” and the verb
proficere
, meaning “to advance.”
Gross Profit
The first level of profitability is
gross profit
, which equals sales minus the cost of goods sold. Sales are the first line item on the income statement, and the
cost of goods sold
(COGS) is generally listed just below it:

Gross Profit = Revenues - COGS
For example, if Company A has $100,000 in sales and a COGS of $60,000, it means the gross profit is $40,000, or $100,000 minus $60,000. Divide gross profit by sales for the
gross profit margin
, which is 40%, or $40,000 divided by $100,000.
Operating Profit
Operating profit removes operating expenses such as overhead and other indirect costs, as well as accounting costs like
depreciation
and amortization.
Operating profit
is sometimes referred to as earnings before interest and taxes, or
EBIT
.
Operating Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) - Operating Expenses - Depreciation & Amortization
Net Profit
Net Profit = EBIT - Interest Expense - Taxes
Net profit removes the costs of interest and taxes paid by the business. Because it falls at the bottom of the income statement, it is sometimes referred to as the firm's ""
bottom line
.""
The bottom line shows how profitable a company was during a period and what is available for dividends and retained earnings. What's retained can be used to pay off debts, fund projects, or reinvest in the company.
Important
An increasing bottom line is a sign that a company is growing, while a shrinking bottom line could be a red flag.
How Do Public Companies Report Profit?
The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
requires public companies to disclose their financial statements in an annual report on
Form 10-K
. The form gives a detailed picture of a company’s operating and financial results for the fiscal year.
1
What Is the History of Profit?
In a
capitalist
system where firms compete with one another to sell their goods, profits have been studied by economists.
Karl Marx
argued that profits arise from surplus labor extracted from workers by business owners. Modern thinkers suggest that profits compensate for the risk that entrepreneurs take on when starting a business. Others argue that profits arise from
inefficient markets
and
imperfect competition
.
2
What Is the Corporate Tax Rate on Profits?
In 2025, the corporate tax rate on profits is 21%, reduced from 35% in the 2017
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
.
3
The Bottom Line
Profit is usually measured as revenue minus expenses. Companies can further calculate profit, accounting for specific costs. Gross profit is the amount a business has earned minus the direct costs of manufacturing. Operating profit is the gross profit minus operational expenses. Net profit is what remains after the business accounts for all deductions, including interest and taxes.

Return on equity (ROE) is a financial performance ratio that demonstrates how it uses shareholders' equity to generate net income.
What Is Return on Equity (ROE)?
Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of a company's financial performance. It is calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is a way of showing a company's return on net assets.
Return on equity is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the more efficient a company's management is at generating income and growth from its equity financing.
Key Takeaways
To calculate return on equity (ROE), divide a company's net income by its shareholders' equity.
ROE is a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits.
The higher the ROE, the better a company is at converting its equity financing into profits.
ROE will vary based on the sector a company is in, so it provides the most accurate information when it's used to compare companies in the same industry.
A shortcut to assessing return on equity is to compare it to the current long-term average of the S&P 500.

How Return on Equity (ROE) Works
ROE is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company. Net income is calculated before dividends paid to common shareholders, after dividends to preferred shareholders, and after interest to lenders.
Whether an ROE is deemed good or bad will depend on what is normal among a stock’s peers. For example, utilities have many assets and debt on the balance sheet compared to a relatively small amount of net income. A normal ROE in the utility sector could be 10% or less. A technology or retail firm with smaller balance sheet accounts relative to net income may have normal ROE levels of 18% or more.
A good rule of thumb is to look for return on equity that is equal to or just above the average for the company's sector—those in the same business. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the past few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo’s management is above average at using the company’s assets to create profits.

Relatively high or low ROE ratios will vary significantly from one industry group or sector to another. However, a common shortcut for investors is to consider anything less than 10% a poor return on equity and anything near the long-term average of the S&P 500 acceptable.
Calculating Return on Equity (ROE)
It is considered best practice to calculate ROE based on average equity over a period because of the mismatch between the income statement and the balance sheet. ROE is calculated by comparing the proportion of net income against the amount of shareholder equity. The equation is:
ROE
=
Net Income
Shareholders’ Equity
\begin{aligned}\textbf{ROE}=\frac{\textbf{Net Income}}{\textbf{Shareholders' Equity}}\end{aligned}
ROE
=
Shareholders’ Equity
Net Income
​
​
Net income is calculated as the difference between net revenue and all expenses including interest and taxes. It is the most conservative measurement for a company to analyze as it deducts more expenses than other profitability measurements such as gross income or operating income.
Average
shareholders' equity
is calculated by adding equity at the beginning of the period. The beginning and end of the period should coincide with the period during which the net income is earned.
Net income over the last full fiscal year is found on the income statement—a sum of financial activity over that period. Shareholders' equity comes from the balance sheet—a running balance of a company’s entire history of changes in assets and liabilities.
Because net income is earned over a period of time and shareholders' equity is a balance sheet account often reporting on a single specific period, an analyst should take an average equity balance. This is often done by taking the average between the beginning and ending equity balances.
Using ROE to Evaluate Stock Performance
Return on equity can be used to estimate different growth rates of a stock that an investor is considering, assuming that the ratio is roughly in line or just above its peer group average.
Future Growth Rate
Investors can use ROE to estimate a stock’s growth rate and the growth rate of its dividends. These two calculations are functions of each other and can be used to make an easier comparison between similar companies.
To estimate a company’s future growth rate, multiply the ROE by the company’s
retention ratio
. The retention ratio is the percentage of net income that is retained or reinvested by the company to fund future growth.
Sustainable Growth Rate
Assume that there are two companies with identical ROEs and net income but different retention ratios. This means they will each have a different
sustainable growth rate
(SGR). The SGR is the rate a company can grow without having to borrow money to finance that growth. The formula for calculating SGR is:
ROE x ( Retained Earnings ÷ Net Income )
You can also use the payout ratio:
ROE x ( 1 - Payout Ratio )
For example, Company A has an ROE of 15% and has a retention ratio of 70%. For Company A, the sustainable growth rate is:
15% x 70% = 10.5%
Company B also has an ROE of 15% but has a 90% retention ratio. Company B's sustainable growth rate is:
15% x 90% = 13.5%
A stock that is growing at a slower rate than its sustainable rate could be undervalued, or the market may be accounting for key risks. In either case, a growth rate that is far above or below the sustainable rate warrants additional investigation.
Using ROE to Identify Risks
A strong return on equity is a positive thing for a company. An extremely high ROE can be a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity because a company’s performance is so strong.
However, an extremely high ROE can also be the result of a small equity account compared to net income, which indicates risk. An outsize ROE can be indicative of a number of issues, such as inconsistent profits or excessive debt. In general, both negative and extremely high ROE levels should be considered worth investigating.
Fast Fact
A return on equity that widely changes from one period to the next may also be an indicator of inconsistent use of accounting methods.
Inconsistent Profits
The first potential issue with a high ROE could be inconsistent profits. Imagine that a company, LossCo, has been unprofitable for several years. Each year’s losses are recorded on the balance sheet in the equity portion as a “
retained loss
.” These losses are a negative value and reduce shareholders' equity.
Now, assume that LossCo has had a windfall in the most recent year and has returned to profitability. The denominator in the ROE calculation is now very small after many years of losses, which makes its ROE misleadingly high.
Excess Debt
A second issue that could cause a high ROE is excess debt. If a company has been borrowing aggressively, it can increase ROE because equity is equal to assets minus debt. The more debt a company has, the lower its equity can fall.
A common scenario is when a company borrows large amounts of debt to buy back its own stock. This can inflate earnings per share (EPS), but it does not affect actual performance or growth rates.
Negative Net Income
Finally, negative net income and negative shareholders' equity can create an artificially high ROE. However, if a company has a net loss or negative shareholders’ equity, calculating the ROE is not worthwhile.
If shareholders’ equity is negative, the most common issue is excessive debt or inconsistent profitability. However, there are exceptions for companies that are profitable and have been using cash flow to buy back their own shares. For many companies, this is an alternative to paying dividends, and it can eventually reduce equity (buybacks are subtracted from equity) enough to turn the calculation negative.
In rare cases, a negative ROE ratio could be due to a cash flow-supported share buyback program and excellent management, but this is less li",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp

Definition
Named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 529 plans are tax-deferred savings plans designed to help pay for college expenses. In some states, qualified withdrawals for these costs are not subject to federal or state taxes.
What Is a 529 Plan?
As higher education costs continue to rise and many Americans are mired in student debt, many parents are turning to tax-advantaged 529 savings plans to help fund their children's education. Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), these plans were originally designed to cover postsecondary education costs.
Their scope has greatly expanded in the last decade. In 2017 and 2019, respectively, Congress passed legislation allowing 529 plans to cover the costs of K–12 education and apprenticeship programs.
1
Later, the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019 and the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 permitted 529 funds to be used for student loan repayment and Roth IRA contributions.
2
3
Key Takeaways
Section 529 plans are tax-advantaged accounts that can be used to pay educational expenses, including K–12 education, apprenticeship programs, and student loan repayment.
There are two basic types of 529 plans: educational savings plans and prepaid tuition plans.
Section 529 plans are sponsored and run by the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
The rules and fees of 529 plans differ from state to state.
How 529 Plans Work
There are two main types of 529 plans:
4
College savings plans and prepaid tuition plans. These offer tax-deferred growth, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified education expenses.
5
These plans remain under the control of the donor, usually a parent.
Prepaid tuition plans enable account owners to lock in current tuition rates for future attendance at selected colleges and universities. Given the rising tuition costs, this generally means locking in lower prices for college later on.
Although 529 plans are named for Section 529 of the federal tax code, they are administered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
6
Anyone can open a 529 account, but parents or grandparents typically establish them on behalf of a child or grandchild, the account's
beneficiary
. In some states, the person who funds the account may be eligible for a state tax deduction for their contributions.
The money in a 529 plan grows tax-deferred until it is withdrawn. What's more, as long as the money is used for qualified education expenses as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), withdrawals aren't subject to either state or federal taxes. In addition, some states may offer tax deductions on contributions.
7
For K–12 students, tax-free withdrawals are limited to $10,000 annually.
8
Since tax benefits vary from state to state, you should check the details of any 529 plan to understand the specific tax benefits to which you may be entitled.
Types of 529 Plans
The two main types of 529 plans have some significant differences.
College Savings Plans
Of the two types, 529 savings plans are more common. The account holder contributes money to the plan, which is invested in a preset selection of investment options.
Account holders can choose which investments (usually mutual funds) they want to make. How those investments perform determines how much the account value grows over time.
Many 529 plans offer
target-date funds
, which adjust their assets as the years go by, becoming more conservative as the beneficiary approaches college age. Withdrawals from a 529 savings plan can be used for college and K–12 qualified expenses. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, room and board, and related costs.
9
The SECURE Act of 2019 expanded tax-free 529 plan withdrawals to include registered apprenticeship program expenses and up to $10,000 in student loan debt repayment for account beneficiaries and their siblings.
3
The SECURE Act of 2022, passed as part of the 2023 omnibus funding bill, permits rolling over up to $35,000 of unspent funds in a 529 account into a Roth IRA account. The account must be at least 15 years old to qualify.
10
11
Prepaid Tuition Plans
A few states and some higher education institutions offer prepaid tuition plans. They vary, but the general principle is that they allow you to lock in tuition at current rates for a student who may not be attending college for years to come. Prepaid plans are not available for K–12 education.
As with 529 savings plans, prepaid tuition plans grow in value over time. Eventual withdrawals from the account used to pay tuition are not taxable. However, unlike savings plans, prepaid tuition plans do not cover the costs of room and board.
Prepaid tuition plans may limit the colleges they can be used for. By contrast, money in a savings plan can be used at almost any eligible institution.
In addition, the money paid into a prepaid tuition plan isn't guaranteed by the federal government and may not be guaranteed by some states.
9
Be sure you understand all aspects of the prepaid tuition plan before you use it.
Fast Fact
There are no limits on how much you can contribute to a 529 account each year. However, many states cap the total amount you can contribute over time, ranging from $235,000 to $621,411.
12
Tax Advantages of 529 Plans
Withdrawals from a
529 plan are exempt
from federal and state income taxes, provided the money is used for qualified educational expenses.
Any other withdrawals are subject to taxes plus a 10% penalty, with exceptions for certain circumstances, such as after death or disability.
9
Contributions to a 529 plan aren't tax-deductible for federal income tax purposes. However, more than 30 states provide tax deductions or credits of varying amounts for these contributions.
12
You need to invest in your home state's plan if you want a state tax deduction or credit. However, some states will allow you to invest in their plans as a nonresident if you're willing to forgo a tax break.
Gift Tax Implications
As of 2025, the annual
gift tax
exclusion has increased to $19,000, up from $18,000 in 2024. This means that you can give up to $19,000 per year to any individual without it counting against your lifetime gift tax exemption, which has also increased to $13.99 million for single filers and $27.98 million for married couples filing jointly, up from $13.61 million and $27.22 million in 2024, respectively.
13
This background on gift taxes is important for 529 plans since there are additional tax advantages for those who wish to contribute to the savings of a future college student. You can contribute up to five years' worth of annual gift tax exclusions in a single lump sum without triggering gift tax consequences. For instance, in 2025, a grandparent could make a one-time contribution of $95,000 to their grandchild's 529 plan ($19,000 annual exclusion x five years).
As long as the grandparent does not make any additional contributions to the same beneficiary over the next five years, this lump-sum contribution will not count against their lifetime gift tax exemption.

529 plans and
individual brokerage accounts
are two popular options when saving for college. A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged investment account designed specifically for education expenses. By contrast, a brokerage account is a general-purpose investment account with no specific tax benefits for education savings.
Section 529 plans are sponsored by a state or financial institution and have limited investment options, often through a menu of mutual funds or ETFs. Your selection may include age-based options that automatically adjust the asset allocation as the beneficiary approaches college age.
They also offer tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified education expenses. Plan withdrawals are tax-free if used for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board.
Some states offer additional tax benefits, such as deductions or credits for contributions to in-state 529 plans. There are no annual contribution limits, but there are limits on the total in a given account, from $235,000 in Georgia to $621,411 in New Hampshire.
15
Meanwhile, brokerage accounts offer a wide range of investment options, including individual stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. There are no contribution limits, but gains and dividends are taxable in the current period. There are also no additional benefits to using the proceeds for educational purposes.
Suppose your child does not end up going to college. In that case, funds in a 529 plan can be transferred to another qualifying family member or used for other education expenses, such as apprenticeships, graduate school, or student loan repayments (up to $10,000). Nonqualified withdrawals or transfers, however, are fully taxable and may carry penalties. Brokerage account funds can be used for any purpose, including education, without restrictions or penalties.
529 Plan Transferability Rules
Section 529 plans have specific transferability rules governed by the federal tax code. The owner may transfer funds to another 529 plan once per year unless a beneficiary change is",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp

A value chain is the full range of activities needed to create a product or service and make it available to consumers.
What Is a Value Chain?
A value chain is a series of consecutive steps that go into the creation of a finished product, from its initial design to its arrival at a customer’s door. The chain identifies each step in the process at which value is added, including the sourcing, manufacturing, and marketing stages of its production.
Key Takeaways
A value chain is a step-by-step business model for transforming a product or service from idea to reality.
Value chains help increase a business’s efficiency so the business can deliver the most value for the least possible cost.
The end goal of a value chain is to create a competitive advantage for a company by increasing productivity while keeping costs reasonable.
Value chain theory analyzes a firm’s five primary activities and four support activities.
Dennis Madamba / Investopedia
Understanding Value Chains
Because of ever-increasing competition for lower prices, better products, and customer loyalty, companies must continually examine the value they create to retain their
competitive advantage
. A
value chain
can help a company to discern areas of its business that are inefficient and implement strategies that will
optimize its procedures
for maximum efficiency and profitability.
In addition to ensuring that production mechanics are seamless and efficient, businesses also need to keep customers confident and secure enough to remain loyal.
Value chain analyses can help
with this, too.
Michael E. Porter, of Harvard Business School, introduced the concept of a value chain in his book, “Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.” He wrote: “Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering, and supporting its product.”
1
In other words, it’s important to maximize value at each specific point in a firm’s processes.
Important
The overarching goal of a value chain is to deliver the most value for the least cost in order to create a competitive advantage.
Components of a Value Chain
In his concept of a value chain, Porter splits a business’s activities into two categories, primary and support, of which sample activities for each are listed below. Specific activities in each category will vary according to the industry.
1
Primary Activities
Primary activities consist of five components, all essential for adding value and creating competitive advantage:
Inbound logistics
include functions like receiving, warehousing, and managing inventory.
Operations
include procedures for converting raw materials into a finished product.
Outbound logistics
include activities to distribute a final product to a consumer.
Marketing and sales
include strategies to enhance visibility and target appropriate customers—such as advertising, promotion, and pricing.
Service
includes programs to maintain products and enhance the consumer experience, like customer service, maintenance, repairs, refunds, and exchange.
Support Activities
The role of support activities is to help make the primary activities more efficient. When you increase the efficiency of any of the four support activities, it benefits at least one of the five primary activities. These support activities are generally denoted as overhead costs on a company’s income statement:
Procurement
concerns how a company obtains raw materials.
Technological development
is used at a firm’s research and development (R&D) stage, like designing manufacturing techniques and automating processes.
Human resources (HR) management
involves hiring and retaining employees who will fulfill the firm’s business strategy and help design, market, and sell the product.
Infrastructure
includes company systems and the composition of its management team, such as planning, accounting, finance, and quality control.
Example of a Value Chain
A value chain example is the privately held grocery store
Trader Joe’s
, which received much press about its tremendous value and competitive edge. Because the company is private, there are many aspects of its strategy that we don’t know. However, when you enter a Trader Joe’s store, you can readily observe instances of Trader Joe’s business that reflect the five primary activities of the value chain.
1.
Inbound logistics:
Unlike traditional supermarkets, Trader Joe’s does all of its receiving, shelving, and inventory during regular store hours. Although potentially maddening for shoppers, this system creates cost savings in terms of employee wages. Moreover, the logistics of having this work take place while customers are still shopping sends the strategic message that “we’re all in this together.”
2.
Operations:
Here’s an example of how a company could apply the value chain creatively. In primary activity number two above, “converting raw materials into finished product” is cited as an “operations” activity. However, because converting raw materials is not an aspect of the supermarket industry, we can use operations to mean any other regular grocery store function. So, let’s substitute “product development,” as that operation is critical for Trader Joe’s.
The company selects its products carefully, featuring items that you generally can’t find elsewhere. Its
private-label
products account for more than 80% of its offerings, which often have the highest
profit margins
, since Trader Joe’s can source them efficiently in volume. Another vital piece of product development for Trader Joe’s is its taste-testing and chef-partnership programs, which ensure high quality and continuous product refinement.
2
3
3.
Outbound logistics:
Many supermarkets offer home delivery, but Trader Joe’s does not. But we can also apply the activity of outbound logistics to apply to the range of amenities that shoppers encounter once they are inside a Trader Joe’s store. The company has thought carefully about the kind of experience it wants customers to have when visiting its stores.
Among Trader Joe’s many tactical logistics are its in-store tastings. Usually, there are a few product tastings happening simultaneously, which create a lively atmosphere and often coincide with the seasons and holidays. The tasting stations feature new and familiar items prepared and served by staff.
4.
Marketing and sales:
Compared to its competitors, Trader Joe’s barely does any traditional marketing. However, its entire in-store experience is a form of marketing. The company’s copywriters craft product labels to appeal specifically to its customer base. The unique branding and innovative culture of Trader Joe’s indicate that the company knows its customers well. Which it should, as the firm has actually chosen the type of customers it prefers and has not deviated from that model.
With this indirect marketing of style and image, Trader Joe’s has differentiated itself in the marketplace, thus sharpening its competitive edge.
5.
Service:
Customer service is paramount for Trader Joe’s. Generally, you see twice as many employees as shoppers in their stores. Whatever work they are doing at the moment, the staff are there primarily to help the customer. In addition, the company has a no-questions-asked refund program.
Explain Like I'm Five
A value chain is the sequence of steps involved in adding value to a product and making it desirable to consumers. Some of the steps are obvious, like manufacturing, packaging, and delivering the product. But it also includes steps after the sale, like marketing, providing customer service, repairing defective products, and offering refunds. All of these steps are important in creating a product that consumers want to buy.
The phrase ""value chain"" evokes a similarity with the term ""supply chain,"" referring to the sequence of manufacturing steps that go into a finished product. Much like supply chains, businesses need to study their value chains to find out where they can improve efficiency and make their products more attractive.
What Is a Value Chain vs. a Supply Chain?
A
supply chain
is the system and resources needed to move a product or service from supplier to customer. A value chain expands on this, also taking into consideration how value is added along the chain, including after the sale is finalized.
What Are the Steps to Value Chain Analysis?

OTC markets refer to the loosely regulated trading of securities either directly between private parties or via broker-dealer networks, rather than on formal exchanges.
Over-the-Counter Markets Basics
Imagine you're a hedge fund looking to buy 100,000 shares of Apple (
AAPL
). To avoid showing your hand to other traders and investors, you might conduct the transactions in an over-the-counter (OTC) market, which offers anonymity.
That's just one use of OTC markets, which involve two parties trading either directly or through broker-dealers rather than on a centralized exchange. Securities traded on OTCs include stocks—many are also listed on U.S. exchanges—bonds,
derivatives
, and cryptocurrencies. Often, the derivatives are complex instruments such as credit-default swaps on mortgage-backed securities, whose trading on the OTC markets played a key role in the global financial crisis.
Financial institutions use OTC markets to trade such derivatives partly because they can tailor contracts however they like—non-standard contracts make up a large portion of the trading on OTC markets. However, the anonymity and flexibility offered by OTC markets come with a tradeoff. OTCs aren't as closely regulated as traditional exchanges, raising increased potential risks for the parties involved.
Key Takeaways
An over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market where participants trade securities not listed on formal exchanges.
OTC trading is mainly facilitated by broker-dealer networks and lacks the strict regulations of centralized national exchanges.
The OTC Markets Group provides price and liquidity information on thousands of securities traded over OTC markets.
OTC markets give investors access to small or foreign companies, currencies, certain bonds, and flexible derivatives.
However, fewer rules, limited transparency, and lower liquidity make OTC markets riskier than trading on formal exchanges.

There is no ""there"" with OTC markets. They are decentralized, with no physical location, yet account for billions of dollars in trades each day. Essentially, an OTC market refers to any trading that doesn't take place on a centralized exchange. Most of the trading takes place through networks of broker-dealers who connect buyers and sellers, though some well-known brokerages now offer retail customers access to those networks via their online platforms. Traders can also trade directly between themselves.

American Depositary Receipts

Some of these bank-issued
certificates trade on national exchanges. Others, particularly those issued without the involvement or approval of the foreign company in question, trade OTC.
3
Bonds
. The
majority of bonds
issued by companies and governments are traded OTC.
Currencies
. Currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and euro, are bought and sold OTC through a network of banks.
Cryptocurrency
. Bitcoin and Ethereum can be traded OTC, enabling the buyer and seller to negotiate directly and keep the terms of the deal private.
Derivatives
. Derivatives can also be traded OTC, and many of the more complex derivatives trade only on OTCs. This allows for privacy, more flexibility, and customization.
How OTC Trading Works
On traditional exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), trades are conducted through a publicly visible centralized order book. Pricing data is transparent and the exchanges, acting as intermediaries, facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers with order-matching systems and the help of
market makers
.
OTC trading is the buying and selling of financial instruments outside of such an exchange. There are two basic types of OTC market—one, a customer market in which investors buy and sell via broker-dealers, and another, the interdealer market, in which broker-dealers quote prices and trade with each other, often to minimize risk.
In the U.S., the largest network is the
OTC Markets Group
. Its services include connecting broker-dealers and providing data and quote services for more than 12,000 securities.
4
Market Tiers
The OTC Markets Group breaks the OTC market into three tiers.
OTCQX
is the top tier. Also called the OTCQX Best Market, this tier houses a large number of
blue-chip stocks
from Europe, Canada, Brazil, and Russia. To trade here, securities must “meet high financial standards, follow best practice corporate governance, demonstrate compliance with U.S. securities laws, and be current in their disclosure.”
5
6
OTCQB is the middle tier. Also known as the venture market, it mainly contains early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies. To be eligible, companies must be current in their reporting, undergo an annual verification and management certification process, meet a $0.01 bid test, and not be in bankruptcy.
7
OTC Pink is the lowest level. It carries no requirements that companies report financials or register with the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Not all securities here are low-quality, although you will find plenty of shell companies and entities in financial distress. (Note: OTC Pink will be relaunched as OTCID Basic Market on July 1, 2025.)

Steps To Trade in the OTC Market
Trading in the OTC market is similar to buying securities on exchanges, except that orders are transacted via a dealer network rather than a centralized exchange, and more caution is generally warranted. Here are the basic steps to follow.
1.
Choose a broker
Choose a reputable one. Look for transparent fees and reliable execution. Many household names, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity, now provide access to OTC markets on their platforms.
2.
Acclimatize and research
Before jumping into a trade, familiarize yourself with the platform and research the security. Consider using OTC Markets Group to evaluate disclosure requirements and risk factors.
3.
Place an order
Placing an OTC order is similar to placing one on a regular exchange. You need to find the security you wish to buy, specify how many units you want, and then hit buy. Beware of the spreads, which can be wide, and consider starting small and placing limit and stop orders.
Pros and Cons of Trading OTC
OTC trading comes with benefits and drawbacks. Here are key points to know:
Advantages
The OTC market gives investors access to alternative securities, including shares of smaller companies that are lesser known and may be undervalued. It can also offer greater flexibility in the terms of any transaction as well as more privacy, which is important to some investors.
OTC markets aren’t as Wild West as some people make out. There are different levels, good investments to be found, and some regulation exists to protect investors.
Pros
Provide access to smaller or foreign companies and alternative assets
High potential upside
Trades are conducted privately
More flexibility and customization options are available on derivatives
Cons
Looser regulation attracts fraudsters and questionable investments
Illiquid and volatile
Less transparency
Counterparty risk
Disadvantages
Looser regulation means OTC markets can be riskier than national exchanges. Companies with poor finances and questionable corporate governance can issue securities here without being required to make the same disclosures as on an exchange. For every good investment, there are murky ones.
Other risks of operating outside the full supervision of a formal exchange include less price transparency, fewer buyers and sellers, which can make exiting a position harder and lead to wider spreads, greater volatility, and the possibility that the other party to the transaction defaults and can’t make good on their side of the trade.
Regulation of OTCs
Though not governed as strictly as national exchanges, OTC markets are subject to some broad SEC regulations related to fraud, market manipulation and disclosure requirements. One of the SEC’s rules calls for broker-dealers to make sure there’s current and publicly available information about an issuer before publishing quotations for it",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp
Investopedia,"Zero-Coupon Swap: What it is, How it Works","Close
What Is a Zero-Coupon Swap?
A zero-coupon swap is an exchange of cash flows in which the stream of floating interest-rate payments is made periodically, as it would be in a
plain vanilla swap
, but where the stream of fixed-rate payments is made as one lump-sum payment at the time when the swap reaches maturity, instead of periodically over the life of the swap.
Key Takeaways
A zero-coupon swap involves the fixed side of the swap being paid in one lump sum when the contract reaches maturity.
The variable side of the swap still makes regular payments, as they would in a plain vanilla swap.
Because the fixed leg is paid as a lump sum, valuing a zero-coupon swap involves determining the present value of those cash flows using a zero-coupon bond's implied interest rate.
Understanding a Zero-Coupon Swap
A zero-coupon swap is a
derivative
contract entered into by two parties. One party makes floating payments which changes according to the future publication of the
interest rate index
(e.g. LIBOR, EURIBOR, etc.) upon which the rate is benchmarked. The other party makes payments to the other based on an agreed fixed interest rate.
The fixed interest rate is tied to a
zero-coupon bond
, or a bond that pays no interest for the life of the bond but is expected to make one single payment at maturity. In effect, the amount of the fixed-rate payment is based on the swap's zero-coupon rate. The bondholder on the end of the fixed leg of a zero-coupon swap is responsible for making one payment at maturity, while the party on the end of the floating leg must make periodic payments over the contract life of the swap. However, zero-coupon swaps can be structured so that both floating and fixed-rate payments are paid as a lump sum.
Since there’s a mismatch in the frequency of payments, the floating party is exposed to a substantial level of
default risk
. The counterparty that does not receive payment until the end of the agreement incurs a greater
credit risk
than it would with a plain vanilla swap in which both fixed and floating interest rate payments are agreed to be paid on certain dates over time.
Valuing a Zero-Coupon Swap
Valuing a zero-coupon swap involves determining the
present value
of the cash flows using a
spot rate
(or zero-coupon rate). The spot rate is an interest rate that applies to a
discount bond
that pays no coupon and produces just one cash flow at the maturity date. The present value of each fixed and floating leg will be determined separately and summed together.
Since the fixed rate payments are known ahead of time, calculating the present value of this leg is straightforward. To derive the present value of cash flows from the floating rate leg, the implied
forward rate
must be calculated first. The forward rates are usually implied from spot rates. The spot rates are derived from a
spot curve
which is built from
bootstrapping
, a technique that shows a sequence of spot (or zero-coupon) rates that are consistent with the prices and yields on coupon bonds.
Variations of the zero-coupon swap exist to meet different investment needs. A
reverse zero-coupon swap
pays the fixed lump-sum payment upfront when the contract is initiated, reducing credit risk for the pay-floating party. Under an
exchangeable zero-coupon swap
, the party scheduled to receive a fixed sum at the maturity date can use an
embedded option
to turn the lump-sum payment into a series of fixed payments.
The floating payer will benefit from this structure if volatility declines and interest rates are relatively stable to declining. It is also possible for the floating-rate payments to be paid as a lump sum in a zero-coupon swap under an exchangeable zero-coupon swap.

The asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue.
What Is the Asset Turnover Ratio?
The asset turnover ratio measures a company's total revenue relative to the value of its assets. The asset turnover ratio indicates how efficiently the company is using its assets to generate revenue.
The higher the asset turnover ratio, the more efficient a company is. If a company has a low asset turnover ratio, it is not efficiently using its assets to create revenue.
Key Takeaways
Asset turnover is the ratio of a company's total sales or revenue to its average assets.
The ratio helps investors understand how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales.
This ratio can be used only for comparison to companies in the same sector, as a ""good"" or ""bad"" number varies widely among industries.
Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
Calculating the Asset Turnover Ratio
The asset turnover ratio uses the value of a company's assets in the denominator of the formula. The average value of the assets for the year is determined using the value of the company's assets on the balance sheet as of the start of the year and at the end of the year.
The sum of the two values is divided by two. Total sales or revenue is found on the company's income statement and is the numerator.

What the Ratio Can Tell You
Typically, the asset turnover ratio is calculated on an annual basis. The higher the asset turnover ratio, the better the company is performing, since higher ratios imply that the company is generating more revenue per dollar of assets.
The asset turnover ratio tends to be higher for companies in certain sectors than others. Retail and consumer staples, for example, have relatively small asset bases but have high sales volume; thus, they have the highest average asset turnover ratio. Conversely, firms in sectors such as
utilities
and real estate have large asset bases and low asset turnover.

Fast Fact
The asset turnover ratio can vary widely from one industry to the next, so comparing the ratios of different sectors, like a retail company with a telecommunications company, would not be productive. Comparisons are only meaningful when they are made for different companies within the same sector.
Examples of the Asset Turnover Ratio
The asset turnover ratio for Walmart Inc. (
WMT
), Target Corporation (
TGT
), AT&T Inc. (
T
), and Verizon Communications Inc. (
VZ
) for FY 2024 is shown in the table below.

Based on 2024 Annual Report Data
AT&T and Verizon have asset turnover ratios of less than one, which is typical for firms in the telecommunications-utilities sector. These companies have large asset bases, so it is expected that they will slowly turn over their assets through sales.
It would not make sense to compare the asset turnover ratios for Walmart and AT&T, since they operate in different industries. Comparing the relative asset turnover ratios for AT&T with Verizon may provide a better estimate of which company is using assets more efficiently in that sector. From the table, Verizon turns over its assets at a faster rate than AT&T.
For every dollar in assets, Walmart generated $2.62 in sales, while Target generated $1.88. Target's turnover could indicate that the retail company was experiencing sluggish sales or holding obsolete inventory. Fixed assets such as property or equipment could be sitting idle or not being utilized to their full capacity.
DuPont Analysis
The asset turnover ratio is a key component of
DuPont analysis
, a system that the DuPont Corporation began in the 1920s to evaluate performance across corporate divisions. The first step of
DuPont analysis breaks down

Sometimes, investors and analysts are more interested in measuring how quickly a company turns its fixed assets or current assets into sales.
In these cases, the analyst can use specific ratios, such as the
fixed-asset turnover ratio
or the
working capital ratio
, to calculate the efficiency of these asset classes. The working capital ratio measures how well a company uses its financing from working capital to generate sales or revenue.
Asset Turnover vs. Fixed Asset Turnover
The asset turnover ratio considers the average
total
assets in the denominator, while the fixed asset turnover ratio looks at only fixed assets.
The fixed asset turnover ratio (
FAT ratio
) is used by analysts to measure operating performance. This efficiency ratio compares net sales on the income statement to fixed assets on the balance sheet to measure a company's ability to generate net sales from its fixed-asset investments, namely property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).
The fixed asset balance is the used net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation
is the allocation of the cost of a fixed asset, which is expensed each year throughout the asset's useful life. Typically, a higher fixed asset turnover ratio indicates that a company has more effectively utilized its investment in fixed assets to generate revenue.
What Is Asset Turnover Measuring?
The asset turnover ratio measures the efficiency of a company's assets in generating revenue or sales. It compares the dollar amount of sales to its total assets as an annualized percentage. Thus, to calculate the asset turnover ratio, divide net sales or revenue by the average total assets. One variation on this metric considers only a company's fixed assets (the FAT ratio) instead of total assets.
What Are Some Limitations of the Asset Turnover Ratio?
While investors may use the asset turnover ratio to compare similar stocks, the metric does not provide all of the details that would be helpful for stock analysis. A company's asset turnover ratio in any single year may differ substantially from previous or subsequent years. Investors should review the trend in the asset turnover ratio over time to determine whether asset usage is improving or deteriorating.
What Is a Good Asset Turnover Value?
Asset turnover ratios vary across different industry sectors, so only the ratios of companies that are in the same sector should be compared. For example, retail or service sector companies have relatively small asset bases combined with high sales volume. This leads to a high average asset turnover ratio. Meanwhile, firms in sectors like utilities or manufacturing tend to have large asset bases, which translates to lower asset turnover.

Investopedia,"Zero-Bound: Definition, Purpose, How It Works, Example","Close
What Is Zero-Bound?
Zero-bound is an
expansionary monetary policy
tool where a
central bank
lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy. A central bank that is forced to enact this policy must also pursue other, often unconventional, methods of stimulus to resuscitate the economy.
Key Takeaways
Zero-bound is an expansionary monetary policy tool where a central bank lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy.
Central banks will manipulate interest rates to either stimulate a stagnating economy or dampen an overheating one.
The Great Recession forced some international central banks to push the limits of zero-bound below the numerical level and implement negative rates to spur growth and spending.
1
Understanding Zero-Bound
Zero-bound refers to the lowest level that
interest rates
can fall to, and logic dictates that zero would be that level. The main arrow in a central bank's monetary policy quiver is interest rates. The bank will manipulate interest rates to either stimulate a stagnating economy or dampen an overheating one. Clearly, there are limits, especially at the lower end of the range.
The zero-bound is the lower limit that rates can be cut to, but no further. When this level is reached, and the economy is still underperforming, then the central bank can no longer provide
stimulus
via interest rates. Economists use the term
liquidity trap
to describe this scenario.
When faced with a liquidity trap, alternative procedures for monetary stimulus often become necessary. Conventional wisdom was that interest rates could not move into negative territory, meaning once interest rates reach zero or are close to zero, for example, 0.01%,
monetary policy
has to be altered to continue to stabilize or stimulate the economy.
The most familiar alternative monetary policy tool is perhaps
quantitative easing
(QE). This is where a central bank engages in a large-scale asset-buying program, often involving treasuries and other
government bonds
. Not only will this keep short-term rates low, but it will push down longer-term rates, which further incentivizes borrowing.
2
Negative Rates
Since the
Great Recession
of 2008 and 2009, some central banks pushed the limits of zero-bound below the numerical level and implemented
negative rates
.
3
As the global economy plummeted, central banks slashed rates to spur growth and spending. However, as the recovery remained slow, central banks began entering the uncharted territory of negative rates.
Sweden was the first country to enter this territory, when in 2009 the Riksbank cut the
repo rate
to 0.25%, which pushed the deposit rate to -0.25%.
4
Since then, the
European Central Bank
(ECB), the
Bank of Japan
(BOJ), and a handful of others followed suit at one time or another.
There are instances where negative rates have been implemented during normal times. Switzerland is one such example; through much of the 2010s, its
target interest rate
was-0.75%, which was raised to -0.50% in 2021.
5
Japan similarly had adopted a
negative interest rate policy
(NIRP), with a target rate of -0.1%.
Example of Zero-Bound and Negative Interest Rates in Switzerland
The
Swiss National Bank
(SNB) maintains a negative interest-rate policy. While there are other examples of negative interest rates, the Swiss example is rather unique in that the country is opting to keep rates very low (and negative) to prevent its
currency
from rising too significantly.
Important
In the Swiss example, negative interest rates are only applied to Swiss franc bank balances over a certain threshold.
Switzerland is viewed as a
safe-haven
, with low political and
inflation
risk. Other examples of negative and zero-bound interest rate policies have often come about because of economic turmoil, which requires cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. The Swiss situation doesn't fit this scenario.
The SNB has maintained that it must keep rates low to prevent its already relatively high currency value from going even higher. A rising currency hurts the Swiss
export
industry. Therefore, the SNB has taken a two-pronged approach to control the currency. The Bank has actively engaged in currency market interventions to help cap the strong
Swiss franc
, and also keeps interest rates low or negative to dissuade strong speculative buying of the franc.
In this situation, the SNB will eventually adopt a zero-bound strategy for moving back to 0% and above. However, that won't happen until the central bank feels it can raise rates without causing too significant of a rise in the currency.

Xetra vs. Other Electronic Trading Systems
Xetra may be one of the largest
electronic trading
systems in the world, but it certainly isn't the only one and wasn't the first to offer the ease of automated trading.
The first automated system for direct trading among U.S. institutions was launched in 1969 and was called
Instinet
(originally named Institutional Networks).
5
Nasdaq
followed with its own automated system in 1971.
6
Trade orders were made on these and other similar systems over the phone.
The
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
launched its
Designated Order Turnaround (DOT)
system, which allowed brokers to route orders directly to specialists on the floor. In 1984, SuperDOT emerged, which effectively expanded the number of shares sent to the floor at one time to nearly 100,000. Nasdaq soon offered the
Small Order Execution System (SOES)
to compete with NYSE.
Electronic trading is fairly common in today's financial industry. It dominates the public markets over physical trading activity, thanks to the rise of internet technology. In fact, very few exchanges offer trading on a physical trading floor. Instead, the majority of trading takes place globally on electronic platforms like Xetra. But there are risks—notably, greater
cybersecurity
threats.
While individuals remain at some level of cyber-attack risk, larger entities such as businesses and government systems are often the main targets of cybersecurity attacks. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses high-tech cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive government information from other countries, nation-states, and individual hackers. Any financial system that stores credit card information from its users is at high risk, along with systems like exchanges.

(GHG) in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol was that industrialized nations needed to reduce their CO2 emissions. The protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, as greenhouse gas emissions threatened climate stability.
1
It was effectively replaced by the Paris Agreement, which went into effect in 2016.
2
Key Takeaways
The Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that called for industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly.
Other accords, like the Doha Amendment, also aimed to compel countries to mobilize against the climate crisis.
The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 replaced the Kyoto Protocol and included commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to reduce their climate-altering pollution.
In 2020, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on the grounds that the mandate was unfair and would hurt the U.S. economy. It rejoined the accord in 2021 and left again in 2025.
Understanding the Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol mandated that
industrialized nations
cut their greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the threat of global warming was growing rapidly. The Protocol was linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on Dec. 11, 1997, and became international law on Feb. 16, 2005.
1
Countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol were assigned maximum carbon emission levels for specific periods and participated in
carbon credit trading
. If a country emitted more than its assigned limit, then it would be penalized by receiving a lower emissions limit in the
following period.
Developed, industrialized countries made a promise under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their annual
hydrocarbon
emissions by an average of 5.2% by the year 2012.
3
Targets depended on the individual country. As a result, each nation had a different target to meet by that year. Members of the
European Union (EU)
pledged to cut emissions by 8%, while the U.S. and Canada promised to reduce their emissions by 7% and 6%, respectively, by 2012.
4
Important
The amount of the Kyoto Protocol fund that was meant to aid developing countries in selecting industrialized processes and technologies that did not emit GHGs.
5
Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms
The Kyoto Protocol established three different mechanisms to enable countries to meet their targeted emissions limits. The three mechanisms were:
The International Emissions Trading Mechanism
: Countries that had excess emission units permitted to them but did not use them could engage in
carbon trading
and sell these units to countries that were over-target.
6
The Clean Development Mechanism:
Countries with emissions reduction or limiting commitments could implement reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified credits.
The Joint Implementation Mechanism:
Countries with emissions reduction or limiting commitments could earn emission-reducing units from a project implemented in conjunction with another party.
7
Responsibilities of Developed vs. Developing Nations
The Kyoto Protocol recognized that developed countries are principally responsible for the high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity.
8
As such, the protocol placed a heavier burden on developed nations compared to less-developed nations.
The Kyoto Protocol mandated that 37 industrialized nations and the EU cut their GHG emissions.
9
Developing nations were asked to comply voluntarily, and more than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the Kyoto agreement altogether.
10
A Particular Function for Developing Countries
The protocol separated countries into two groups: Annex I contained developed nations, and Non-Annex I referred to developing countries. The protocol placed emission limitations on Annex I countries only. Non-Annex I nations participated by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries.
11
For these projects, developing countries earned
carbon credits
, which they could trade or sell to developed countries, allowing the developed nations a higher level of maximum carbon emissions for that period. In effect, this function helped the developed countries to continue emitting GHG vigorously.
6
U.S. Involvement
The U.S., which ratified the original Kyoto Protocol, dropped out of the protocol in 2001. The U.S. believed that the agreement was unfair because it called only for industrialized nations to limit emissions reductions, and it felt that doing so would hurt the U.S. economy.
12
Additional Kyoto Protocol Changes
Global emissions were still on the rise by 2005, the year the Kyoto Protocol became international law.
13
In fact, there was an increase of about 40% in emissions globally between 1990 and 2009.
14
The EU was able to exceed its initial target and said it was on track to meet its goals to continue reducing emissions in the future.
15
However, the United States and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, produced enough greenhouse gases to mitigate any of the progress made by other nations that met their targets.
16
The Doha Amendment Extended Kyoto Protocol to 2020
In December 2012, after the first commitment period of the Protocol ended, parties to the Kyoto Protocol met in Doha, Qatar, to adopt an amendment to the original Kyoto agreement. This so-called Doha Amendment added new emission reduction targets for the second commitment period, 2012–2020, for participating countries.
17
The Doha Amendment had a short life. In 2015, at the sustainable development summit held in Paris, all UNFCCC participants signed yet another pact, the
Paris Climate Agreement
, which effectively replaced the Kyoto Protocol.
The Paris Climate Agreement
The Paris Climate Agreement is a landmark environmental pact that was adopted by nearly every nation in 2015 to
address climate change
and its negative effects. The agreement includes commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to cut their climate-altering pollution and to strengthen those commitments over time.
18
A major directive of the deal calls for reducing global GHG emissions to limit the earth's temperature increase in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with an aim for below 1.5-degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement also provides a way for developed nations to assist developing nations in their efforts to adapt climate control, and it creates a framework for monitoring and reporting countries’ climate goals
transparently
.
2
Fast Fact
Every five years, countries engage in the Global Stocktake, which is an assessment of their progress under the Paris Climate Agreement.
19
The Kyoto Protocol Today
In 2016, when the Paris Climate Agreement went into force, the United States was one of the principal drivers of the agreement, and President Obama hailed it as “a tribute to American leadership.”
20
In the same period, presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized the agreement as a bad deal for the American people and pledged to withdraw from the agreement if elected. In 2017, then-President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.
The Trump administration did not begin the formal withdrawal process until Nov. 4, 2019.
21
The U.S. formally withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the 2020 presidential election, in which Donald Trump lost his reelection bid to Joseph Biden.
22
23
On Jan. 20, 2021, his first day in office, President Biden began the process of rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, which officially took effect on Feb. 19, 2021.
24
However, when President Trump returned to office in 2025, he again announced his intention to exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to that effect.

The coefficient of variation (CV) helps investors determine how much volatility, or risk, is assumed when comparing the return expected from different investments.
What Is the Coefficient of Variation (CV)?
The coefficient of variation represents the ratio of the
standard deviation
to the expected return. It is a useful statistic for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another. It can be expressed as a decimal or a percentage.
The CV formula measures the deviation between the historical
mean
price and the current price performance of a financial asset, like stocks or bonds, relative to other investments.
Key Takeaways
The standard deviation measures how far the average value lies from the mean, whereas the coefficient of variation measures the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
The coefficient of variation is used to compare two or more data sets.
The lower the CV, the better the risk-return tradeoff.

Understanding the Coefficient of Variation (CV)
The coefficient of variation shows the extent of
variability
of data in a sample relative to the mean of the population. In finance, the coefficient of variation allows investors to determine how much
volatility
, or
risk
, is assumed in comparison to the amount of return expected from investments.
The lower the coefficient of variation, the better the
risk-return tradeoff
.
1
CVs are most often used to analyze dispersion around the mean, but quartile, quintile, or decile CVs can also be used to understand variation around the median or 10th percentile, for example.
Important
The coefficient of variation formula can be used to determine the deviation between the historical mean price and the current price performance of a stock, commodity, or bond, relative to other assets.

CV in Excel
The coefficient of variation formula can be performed in Excel by first using the standard deviation function for a data set. Next, calculate the mean by using the Excel function provided. Since the coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, divide the cell containing the standard deviation by the cell containing the mean.
Coefficient of Variation (CV) vs. Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a data set relative to its mean. It is used to determine the spread of values in a single data set rather than to compare different units.
When we want to compare two or more data sets, the coefficient of variation is used. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. And because it’s independent of the unit in which the measurement was taken, it can be used to compare data sets with different units or widely different means.
In short, the standard deviation measures how far the average value lies from the mean, whereas the coefficient of variation measures the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
2
Advantages and Disadvantages of the CV
Advantages
The coefficient of variation can be useful when comparing data sets with different units or very different means.
3
That includes when the risk/reward ratio is used to select investments. For example, a
risk-averse
investor may want to consider assets with a historically low degree of volatility relative to the return, to the overall market or its industry. Conversely, risk-seeking investors may look to invest in assets with a historically high degree of volatility.
Disadvantages
When the mean value is close to zero, the CV becomes very sensitive to small changes in the mean. Using the example above, a notable flaw would be if the expected return in the denominator is negative or zero. In this case, the coefficient of variation could be misleading.
3
How Can the CV Be Used?
The coefficient of variation is used in many different fields, including chemistry, engineering, physics, economics, and neuroscience.
Other than helping when using the risk/reward ratio to select investments, it is used by economists to measure economic inequality. Outside of finance, it is commonly applied to audit the precision of a particular process and arrive at a perfect balance.
Example: CV for Selecting Investments
For example, consider a risk-averse investor who wishes to invest in an
exchange-traded fund (ETF)
, which is a basket of securities that tracks a broad market index. The investor selects the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). Then, the investor analyzes the ETFs’ returns and volatility over the past 15 years and assumes that the ETFs could have similar returns to their long-term averages.
For illustrative purposes, the following 15-year historical information is used for the investor’s decision:
If the SPDR S&P 500 ETF has an average annual return of 5.47% and a standard deviation of 14.68%, the SPY’s coefficient of variation is 2.68.
If the Invesco QQQ ETF has an average annual return of 6.88% and a standard deviation of 21.31%, the QQQ’s coefficient of variation is 3.10.
If the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has an average annual return of 7.16% and a standard deviation of 19.46%, the IWM’s coefficient of variation is 2.72.
Based on the approximate figures, the investor could invest in either the SPDR S&P 500 ETF or the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, since the risk/reward ratios are approximately the same and indicate a better risk-return tradeoff than the Invesco QQQ ETF.
What Does the Coefficient of Variation Tell Us?
The coefficient of variation (CV) indicates the size of a standard deviation in relation to its mean. The higher the coefficient of variation, the greater the dispersion level around the mean.
2
What Is Considered a Good Coefficient of Variation?
That depends on what you’re looking at and comparing. No set value can be considered universally “good.” However, generally speaking, it is often the case that a lower coefficient of variation is more desirable, as that would suggest a lower spread of data values relative to the mean.
How Do I Calculate the Coefficient of Variation?
To calculate the coefficient of variation, first find the mean, then the sum of squares, and then work out the standard deviation. With that information at hand, it is possible to calculate the coefficient of variation by dividing the standard deviation by the mean.
2
The Bottom Line
The coefficient of variation is a simple way to compare the degree of variation from one data series to another. It can be applied to several contexts, including the process of picking suitable investments.
A high CV indicates that the group is more variable, whereas a low value would suggest the opposite. Generally, a lower CV suggests a more favorable risk-to-reward ratio.

Definition
The law of supply and demand combines two fundamental economic principles that describe how changes in the price of a resource, commodity, or product affect its supply and demand.
What Is the Law of Supply and Demand?
The law of supply and demand compares supplier preferences (i.e. supply) with consumer preferences (i.e. demand). All else being equal, supply rises while demand declines as the price increases. Levels of supply and demand for varying prices can be plotted on a graph as curves, and the intersection of these curves marks the
equilibrium
or market-clearing price at which demand equals supply and represents the process of
price discovery
in the marketplace.
Key Takeaways
The law of demand holds that the demand level for a product or a resource will decline as its price rises and rise as the price drops.
The law of supply says that higher prices boost the supply of an economic good and lower ones tend to diminish it.
A market-clearing price balances supply and demand and can be graphically represented as the intersection of the supply and demand curves.
The degree to which changes in price translate into changes in demand and supply is known as the product's price elasticity.
Demand for basic necessities is relatively inelastic. It's less responsive to changes in their price.
Investopedia / Alex Dos Diaz
Understanding the Law of Supply and Demand
It may seem obvious that the price satisfies both the buyer and the seller in any sale transaction, matching supply with demand. The interactions between supply, demand, and price in a free marketplace have been observed for thousands of years.
1
Many medieval thinkers distinguished between a ""just"" price based on costs and equitable returns and one at which the sale was transacted, just like modern-day critics of market pricing for select commodities.
2
Our understanding of price as a signaling mechanism matching supply and demand is rooted in the work of Enlightenment economists who studied and summarized the relationship.
Supply and demand don't necessarily respond to price movements proportionally. The degree to which price changes affect the product's demand or supply is known as its price elasticity.

Fast Fact
Price discovery based on supply and demand curves assumes a marketplace in which buyers and sellers are free to transact or not depending on the price.
Products with a high
price elasticity of demand
will see wider fluctuations in demand based on the price. Basic necessities will be relatively inelastic in price because people can't easily do without them so demand will change less relative to changes in the price.
Factors such as taxes and government regulation, the market power of suppliers, the availability of substitute goods, and economic cycles can all shift the supply or demand curves or alter their shapes. However, the commodities affected by these external factors remain subject to the fundamental forces of supply and demand as long as buyers and sellers retain agency.
The Law of Demand
The
law of demand
holds that demand for a product
changes inversely to its price
when all else is equal. The higher the price, the lower the level of demand.
Buyers have finite resources so their spending on a given product or commodity is limited as well. Higher prices reduce the quantity demanded as a result. Demand rises as the product becomes more affordable.
Important
Changes in demand levels as a function of a product's price relative to buyers' income or resources are known as the
income effect
.
But some exceptions exist. One is
Giffen Goods
. These are typically low-priced staples also known as
inferior goods
. They're those who see a drop in demand when incomes rise because consumers trade up for higher-quality products.
The
substitution effect
turns the product into a Giffen good when the price of an inferior good rises and demand goes up because consumers use more of it in place of costlier alternatives.
Veblen goods
are at the opposite end of the income and wealth spectrum. They're luxury goods that gain in value and consequently generate higher demand levels as they rise in price because the price of these luxury goods signals and may even increase the owner's status.
Veblen goods are named for economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen who developed the concept and coined the term ""conspicuous consumption"" to describe it.
3
The Law of Supply
The
law of supply
relates price changes for a product to the quantity supplied. The law of supply relationship is direct, not inverse. The higher the price, the higher the
quantity supplied
. Lower prices mean reduced supply all else being equal.
Higher prices give suppliers an incentive to supply more of the product or commodity, assuming their costs aren't increasing as much. Lower prices result in a cost squeeze that curbs supply. Supply slopes are upwardly sloping as a result.
As with demand, supply constraints may limit the
price elasticity of supply
for a product.
Supply shocks
can cause a disproportionate price change for an essential commodity.
Equilibrium Price
Also called a market-clearing price, the equilibrium price is that at which demand matches supply, producing a market equilibrium that's acceptable to buyers and sellers.
Supply and demand in terms of the quantity of the goods are balanced at the point where an upward-sloping supply curve and a downward-sloping demand curve intersect leaving no surplus supply or unmet demand.
The level of the market-clearing price depends on the shape and position of the respective supply and demand curves, which are influenced by numerous factors.
Factors Affecting Supply
Supply will tend to decline toward zero at product prices below production costs in industries where suppliers aren't willing to lose money.
Price elasticity will also depend on the number of sellers, their aggregate productive capacity, how easily it can be lowered or increased, and the industry's
competitive dynamics
. Taxes and regulations may matter as well.
Factors Affecting Demand
Consumer income, preferences, and willingness to substitute one product for another are among the most important determinants of demand.
Consumer preferences will depend in part on a product's market penetration because the
marginal utility
of goods
diminishes
as the quantity owned increases. The first car is more life-altering than the fifth addition to the fleet. The living room TV is more useful than the fourth one for the garage.
What Is a Simple Explanation of the Law of Supply and Demand?
Higher prices cause supply to increase as demand drops. Lower prices boost demand while limiting supply. The market-clearing price is one at which supply and demand are balanced.
Why Is the Law of Supply and Demand Important?
The law of supply and demand is essential because it helps investors, entrepreneurs, and economists understand and predict market conditions. A company that's considering a price hike on a product will typically expect demand for it to decline as a result and will attempt to estimate the price elasticity and substitution effect to determine whether to proceed.
What Is an Example of the Law of Supply and Demand?
Gasoline consumption plunged with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and prices quickly followed because the industry ran out of storage space. The price decline in turn served as a powerful signal to suppliers to curb gasoline production. Crude oil prices in 2022 then provided producers with additional incentive to boost output.
4
5
The Bottom Line
The law of supply and demand reflects two central economic principles that describe the relationship between price, supply, and demand.
The law of demand posits that demand declines when prices rise for a given resource, product, or commodity. Demand increases as prices fall. On the supply side, the law posits that producers supply more of a resource, product, or commodity as prices rise. Supply falls as prices fall.
The price at which demand matches supply is the equilibrium, the point at which the market clears. The law of supply and demand is critical in helping all players within a market understand and forecast future conditions.

What Is Creative Destruction?
Creative destruction is the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for innovation and is seen as a driving force of
capitalism
.
Key Takeaways
Creative destruction describes the deliberate dismantling of established processes in order to make way for improved methods of production.
Creative destruction is most often used to describe disruptive technologies such as the railroads or, in our own time, the internet.
The term was coined in the early 1940s by economist Joseph Schumpeter, who observed real-life examples of creative destruction, such as Henry Ford’s assembly line.
Creative destruction can be seen across many different industries such as technology, retail, and finance.
Creative destruction often has unintended consequences such as temporary losses of jobs, environmental issues, or inequity.
Understanding Creative Destruction
The term creative destruction was first coined by Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter
in 1942. Schumpeter characterized creative destruction as innovations in the manufacturing process that increase
productivity
, describing it as the ""process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.""
Investopedia / Alison Czinkota
Basically, the theory of creative destruction assumes that long-standing arrangements and assumptions must be destroyed to free up resources and energy to be deployed for innovation. To Schumpeter, economic development is the natural result of forces internal to the market and is created by the opportunity to seek
profit
.
Creative destruction theory treats
economics
as an organic and dynamic process. This stands in stark contrast with the static mathematical models of traditional Cambridge-tradition economics.
Equilibrium
is no longer the end goal of market processes. Instead, many fluctuating dynamics are constantly reshaped or replaced by innovation and competition.
As is implied by the word destruction, the process inevitably results in losers and winners. Producers and workers committed to the older technology will be left stranded.
Entrepreneurs
and workers in new technologies, meanwhile, will inevitably create
disequilibrium
and highlight new profit opportunities.
In describing creative destruction, Schumpeter was not necessarily endorsing it. In fact, his work is considered to be heavily influenced by
The Communist Manifesto
, the pamphlet by
Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels which decried the bourgeoisie for its ""constant revolutionizing of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions.""

Netflix is a modern example of creative destruction, having overthrown disc rental and traditional media industries.
Principles of Creative Destruction
Innovation:
Creative destruction involves the introduction of new ideas, products, and technologies that replace the existing ones. Innovation is the driving force of creative destruction. Without innovation, creative destruction could not exist and without innovators, there would be no change agents that could make creative destruction happen.
Competition:
The process of creative destruction involves intense competition between the old and new technologies or products. The new products or technologies must prove to be better and more efficient than the old ones to replace them. For this reason, creative destruction is usually heavily tied to competition and
competitive advantages
. Companies usually strive to find the best ways to do things and are often willing to creatively destroy what they've done in the past to find better long-term solutions.
Entrepreneurship:
Entrepreneurship is also critical to the process of creative destruction. The entrepreneurs who develop new products and technologies and disrupt existing markets are the agents of creative destruction. They are responsible for overseeing change management, educating both internal staff and consumers on how this change will impact them. Without clear guidance on the intention of the creative destruction, the entrepreneur will likely fail in their attempt to innovate.
Capital:
Last, a cornerstone principle of creative destruction is capital. Making sweeping, radical innovate changes is often expensive, and companies must be prepared to take on financial risk to make this change. Most often, companies will seen
venture capital
investments to aid with funding the creative destruction.
Creative Destruction Across Industries
Creative destruction can be seen across many different industries. As all companies often strive to be better, many businesses seek new ways to disrupt the status quo and seek new paths to better business opportunity. Some examples of those industries are below.
Technology:
The technology industry is perhaps the most obvious example of creative destruction at work. New technologies and software products are constantly emerging, replacing older ones and disrupting established markets. Companies may also creatively destroy their own products (i.e. Apple) in order to make way for better, more innovate solutions.
Media and Entertainment:
The rise of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime has disrupted the traditional media and entertainment industry, leading to the decline of cable TV and traditional movie theaters. Now, these streaming platforms are reinventing the wheel again by investing into making their own content.
Retail:
The growth of
e-commerce
has disrupted traditional retail, leading to the closure of many physical stores and the rise of online marketplaces. Consider the last time you visited a physical shopping mall. For many, it's been longer than when they last placed their last online purchase. Now, online retailers are upping the ante by expanding into other nontraditional forms of digital shopping (i.e. grocery foods).
Finance:
The rise of fintech startups has disrupted the traditional banking and finance industry, offering new and innovative services that challenge the traditional players. Now, people can invest in tokenized, fractionalized pieces of physical, tangible land.
Energy:
The development of renewable energy technologies is disrupting the traditional energy industry, leading to the decline of fossil fuels and the rise of solar and wind power. These companies are now needing to find more innovative ways to provide green solutions that make the inventions just a decade old obsolete.
Fast Fact
Companies don't technically need to embark on creative destruction; however, by not doing so, they risk the occurrence of falling behind their competition.
Limitations of Creative Destruction
Though creative destruction can lead to many long-term positive aspects of economic growth and innovation, it does come with downsides. As old industries and technologies are replaced, jobs may be lost. This can lead to unemployment and hardship for those who are displaced due to the nature of their previous employment relating to an antiquated industry. It can also take time for new jobs and industries to emerge.
The benefits of creative destruction may also not be evenly distributed. Wealth and power may become concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or companies that are able to succeed in the new markets. This is often the case for those who have the best access to power, capital, or influence. Those who have already succeeded are also the most likely to have the best opportunity to embark on creative destruction.
The process of creative destruction may also have negative environmental consequences. New technologies and products may have unforeseen environmental impacts that are not immediately apparent, and the process of replacing old technologies with new ones may also have an environmental cost. It may sometimes take years for enough evidence has been collected to truly see the long-term implications of certain forms of innovation.
Creative Destruction Examples
Examples of creative destruction in history include Henry Ford's
assembly line
and how it revolutionized the automobile manufacturing industry. However, it also displaced older markets and forced many laborers out of work.
The internet is perhaps the most all-encompassing example of creative destruction, where the losers were not only retail clerks and their employers but also bank tellers, secretaries, and travel agents. The mobile internet added many more losers, from taxi cab drivers to mapmakers.
The winners, beyond the obvious example of programmers, might be just as numerous. The entertainment industry was turned upside down by the internet, but its need for creative talent and product remains the same or greater. The internet destroyed many small businesses but created many new ones online.
The point, as Schumpeter noted, is that an evolutionary process rewards improvements and innovations and punishes less efficient ways of organizing resources. The
trend line
is toward progress, growth, and higher
standards of living
overall.
Why Is Creative Destruction a Good Thing?
While creative destruction can cause short-term pain and job losses, it is generally seen as a positive force for long-term economic growth and progress. Creative destruction is driven by innovation, which is a key driver of economic growth.  Creative destruction also encourages competition, which helps to keep prices low and quality high. Last, it may help the economy become more resilient by breaking up monopolies and reducing reliance on outdated industries or technologies.
What Emerges From Creative Destruction?
Creative destruction can give rise to entirely new industries that did not exist before. For example, the rise of the internet has created new industries, such as e-commerce, social media, and digital marketing. This also means that existing products and services are replaced by new innovations which can lead to brand new business models.

Definition
Joseph Schumpeter was an economist known for his theories on entrepreneurship and creative destruction describing how innovation drives economic growth by replacing outdated practices and technologies.
Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883-1950) was an Austrian-trained economist, economic historian, and author. He is regarded as one of the 20
th
century's greatest intellectuals. Schumpeter is best known for his theories on
business cycles
and the development of
capitalist economies
, and for introducing the concept of entrepreneurship. For Schumpeter, the entrepreneur was the cornerstone of capitalism—the source of innovation, which is the vital force driving a capitalist economy.
Key Takeaways
Joseph Alois Schumpeter is best known for his 1942 book
Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy
, the theory of creative destruction, and for offering the first German and English references to methodological individualism in economics.
Schumpeter served as minister of finance in the Austrian government, the president of a private bank, and a professor, before being forced to emigrate, due to the rise of the Nazi Party.
The economist coined the term ""creative destruction"" to describe how the old is being constantly replaced by the new.
Schumpeter also introduced the concept of entrepreneurship.
Schumpeter’s work was initially overshadowed by the contrasting theories of his contemporary, John Maynard Keynes, but it now has become the centerpiece for modern thinking on how economies evolve.
Investopedia / Alison Czinkota
Early Life and Education
Schumpeter was born in Moravia (now the Czech Republic) in 1883, to German parents. He studied economics from the progenitors of the
Austrian school tradition
, including Friedrich von Wieser and Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk. Schumpeter served as minister of finance in the Austrian government, the president of a private bank, and a university professor. From 1925 to 1932, Schumpeter held a chair at the University of Bonn.
1
Uncomfortable at the rise of the Nazi Party, he moved to the United States to teach at Harvard in 1932. Fifteen years later, in 1947, he became the first immigrant to be elected president of the American Economic Association.
1
By the early 20th century, economic science in the United States and Great Britain had developed alongside static and mathematically oriented
general equilibrium
models. Schumpeter’s work differed at times, typifying the continental European approach—more nuanced and less hypothetical—although some of his theories were drawn from
Walrasian
general equilibrium as well.
Notable Accomplishments and Theories
Schumpeter made many contributions to economic science and political theory, but he is best known for his 1942 book
Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy
, which outlines the theory of dynamic
economic growth
known as
creative destruction
.
2
He is also credited with the first German and English references to methodological individualism in economics.
Creative Destruction
Schumpeter's most enduring legacy came from a six-page chapter in
Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy
entitled “The Process of Creative Destruction.”
2
In this chapter, Schumpeter offered a new, unique insight into how economies grow, sharply deviating from the traditional economic dictums of his day, which held that markets passively tend toward
equilibrium
until
profit margins
are wiped out. Instead, Schumpeter argued, economic progress is not gradual and peaceful but rather disjointed, abrupt, and sometimes unpleasant. The economist used the term ""creative destruction"" to describe the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for new technologies, new kinds of products, new methods of production, and new means of distribution.
Existing companies must quickly adapt to a new environment (or fail). If it sounds somewhat Darwinian—it is, Schumpeter intimated: a ""process of industrial mutation—if I may use that biological term—that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one,"" as he wrote. ""This
process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.”
Entrepreneurship
In many respects, Schumpeter saw capitalism as a sort of ongoing revolution that disrupts the current social and economic hierarchy. And within this system, the
entrepreneur
becomes the revolutionary, upsetting the established order to create dynamic change.
Schumpeter is believed to be the first scholar to introduce the world to the concept—or at least, the economic significance of—entrepreneurship. He came up with the German word
Unternehmergeist,
meaning entrepreneur-spirit, adding that these individuals controlled the economy because they are responsible for delivering innovation and technological change.
Entrepreneurs are often the guiding force behind creative destruction because they advance the new products, technology, and/or production methods that provide an impulse for change. Entrepreneurial innovation and experimentation constantly destroy the status quo and introduce new equilibria, making possible higher
standards of living
.
Business Cycles
These theories tie in with Schumpeter’s belief in the presence of
business cycles
.
In Schumpeter's analysis, the history of capitalism has been punctuated by
long and short waves
. A long wave is prompted by a new set of technologies and industries coming into existence. According to this theory, major advances in innovation can be predicted to occur every 50 or 100 years.
""Barring very few cases in which difficulties arise, it is possible to count off, historically as well as statistically, six Juglars [8-10-year business cycles] to a Kondratieff [50-60 years] and three Kitchins [40 months] to a Juglar—not as an average but in every individual case,” wrote Schumpeter in his book
The Theory of Economic Development
, published in 1911.
Whenever an entrepreneur disrupts an existing industry, it is likely that existing workers, businesses, or even entire sectors can be temporarily thrown into loss, he said. These cycles are tolerated, he explained, because it allows resources to be freed up for other, more productive uses.
Example of Schumpetarian Theory
The internet is one of the best examples of creative destruction, the term that Schumpeter coined to describe the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for new technologies, new kinds of products, new methods of production, and new means of distribution. Existing companies must quickly adapt to a new environment (or fail).
The advent of the Internet rendered many products, methods of production, and means of distribution obsolete. It also caused a drastic curtailing of many jobs, including the roles of bank tellers, secretaries, travel agents, and retail store employees. With the rise of mobile internet technology, publishers of printed material—everything from magazines to maps—also suffered.
The Internet, in addition to other innovations in the field of information technology—the microprocessor, the laser, fiber optics, and satellite technologies—have all fundamentally altered the way that business is conducted.
Joseph Schumpeter vs. John Maynard Keynes
Over his many years in public life, Schumpeter developed informal rivalries with the other great economic thinkers of the west, including
John Maynard Keynes
, Irving Fisher,
Ludwig von Mises
, and
Friedrich Hayek
. His work initially was overshadowed by some of these contemporaries', especially Keynes. Although they were born just a few months apart, the pair had radically different views.
Fast Fact
In his early career, Schumpeter derided the use of statistical aggregates in economic theory—likely a shot at Keynes—in favor of focusing on individual choice and action.
Keynes viewed the economy as healthy when in static equilibrium. Schumpeter rejected this theory, claiming that equilibrium is not healthy and that innovation is the driver of the economy. Both had contrasting views on government intervention, too. Keynes believed that a permanent equilibrium of prosperity could be achieved by central bank
monetary policies
. Schumpeter argued that government intervention increased
inflation
, destroying the economy.

What Is Joseph Schumpeter’s History of Economic Analysis?
At the time of his death, in 1950, Schumpeter was working on a new book,
History of Economic Analysis.
In the book, Schumpeter attempts a complete history of the field of economics, from ancient Greece to the present day (the end of World War II). Not just limited to economics, the book also traced the history of political and philosophical ideas and served as a record of significant events.
Although never fully completed,
History of Economic Analysis
has gained recognition as an important work, due to its broad scope and original examination of significant historical events. Some notable topics it addresses include the techniques of economic analysis, contemporaneous developments in other sciences, and the sociology o",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/joseph-schumpeter.asp

What Is a Giffen Good?
A Giffen good is a low-income, non-luxury product that defies standard economic and consumer demand theory. Demand for Giffen goods rises when the price rises and falls when the price falls. In econometrics, this results in an upward-sloping demand curve, contrary to the fundamental
laws of demand
which create a downward sloping demand curve.
The term ""Giffen good"" was coined in the late 1800s, named after noted Scottish
economist
, statistician, and journalist Sir Robert Giffen. The concept of Giffen goods focuses on low-income, non-luxury products that have very few close substitutes.
1
Giffen goods can be compared to Veblen goods which similarly defy standard economic and consumer demand theory but focus on luxury goods.
Examples of Giffen goods can include bread, rice, and wheat. These goods are commonly essentials with few near-dimensional substitutes at the same price levels.
2
Investopedia / Laura Porter
Understanding Giffen Goods
Giffen goods are a rarity in economics because supply and demand for these goods are opposite of standard conventions. Giffen goods can be the result of multiple market variables including supply, demand, price, income, and substitution. All of these variables are central to the basic theories of supply and demand economics. Examples of Giffen goods are a study in the effects of these variables on low-income, non-luxury goods which result in an upward sloping demand curve.
Key Takeaways
A Giffen good is a low-income, non-luxury product for which demand increases as the price increases and vice versa.
A Giffen good has an upward-sloping demand curve which is contrary to the fundamental laws of demand which are based on a downward sloping demand curve.
Demand for Giffen goods is heavily influenced by a lack of close substitutes and income pressures.
Veblen goods are similar to Giffen goods but with a focus on luxury items.
Supply and Demand
The laws of
supply and demand
govern macro and microeconomic theories. Economists have found that when prices rise, demand falls creating a downward sloping curve. When prices fall, demand is expected to increase creating an upward sloping curve. Income can slightly mitigate these results, flattening curves since more personal income can result in different behaviors. Substitution and the
substitution effect
can also be significant. Since there are typically substitutes for most goods, the substitution effect helps strengthen the case for standard supply and demand.
In the case of Giffen goods, the income effect can be substantial while the substitution effect is also impactful. With Giffen goods, the demand curve is upward sloping which shows more demand at higher prices. Since there are few substitutes for Giffen goods, consumers continue to remain willing to buy a Giffen good when the price rises. Giffen goods are usually essential items as well which then incorporates both the income effect and a higher price substitution effect. Since Giffen goods are essential, consumers are willing to pay more for them but this also limits disposable income which makes buying slightly higher options even more out of reach. Therefore, consumers buy even more of the Giffen good. Overall, both the income and substitution effects are at work to create unconventional supply and demand results.
3
Historical Research and Giffen Good Examples
In his textbook ""Principles of Economics,"" economist Alfred Marshall described Robert Giffen’s work in the context of bread rising in price because people lacked the income to buy meat.
4
However, in 1947, the meat-bread example was challenged by George J. Stigler in his article ""Notes on the History of the Giffen Paradox.""
5
Another example of the existence of a Giffen good was offered by a 2007 study authored by Harvard economists Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller, who conducted a field experiment in the Hunan province of China, where rice is a dietary staple, and in the Gansu province, where wheat is the staple. Randomly selected households in both provinces were given
vouchers
that subsidized the purchase of their respective staple foods.
Jensen and Miller found strong evidence of Giffen behavior exhibited by Hunan households with respect to rice. Lowering the price of rice through the subsidy caused reduced demand by households for the rice while increasing the price by removing the subsidy had the opposite effect. However, the evidence of wheat in Gansu was weaker.
6
Giffen Goods vs. Veblen Goods
Both Giffen goods and
Veblen goods
are nonordinary
goods that defy standard supply and demand conventions
. With both Giffen and Veblen goods, a product’s demand curve is upward sloping. Income and substitution are key factors in explaining the econometrics of the upward sloping demand curve for Giffen goods as discussed.
7
Veblen goods also have an upward sloping demand curve but with some slightly different influences. Veblen goods are premium product, luxury goods. Examples can include celebrity-endorsed perfumes or fine wines. With these goods, their high price is associated with a high social status symbol. As such, high-income consumers find these goods more desirable at a higher price. The income effect has little impact on these goods because income is not a factor. Substitution is also a minimal factor because the goods are generally status symbols and not cross-dimensional.

Investopedia,"Quality Control (QC): What It Is, How It Works, and QC Careers","Close
Definition
Quality control is a process employed by businesses to ensure that their products are manufactured to meet defined quality standards.
What Is Quality Control (QC)?
Quality control (QC) is a system that ensures that manufactured products are produced and maintained to a high standard. Quality control requires companies to create an environment where management and employees strive for perfection. This is done by training personnel, creating product quality
benchmarks
, and testing products for
statistically significant
variations.
QC requires the
establishment of well-defined controls
to help standardize production and reactions to quality issues.
Key Takeaways
Quality control (QC) not only ensures that a business’s products meet or improve quality standards, but also influences its employees’ attitudes and creates a sense of ownership.
QC involves testing units to determine if they are within the specifications for the final product.
The quality control used in a business depends on the product or industry, and several techniques exist for measuring quality.
The food industry uses quality control methods to ensure customers don’t get sick from their products.
Quality control creates safe measures that can be implemented to make sure deficient or damaged products don’t end up with customers.
Understanding Quality Control (QC)
Creating a product is costly, time-consuming, and can be unsafe without controls in place. A company that puts defective products on the market may be held liable for injuries or issues that arise from using its products. Quality control inspectors ensure that
defective or unsafe products are identified
, and that the causes are corrected.
Quality control involves testing units and determining if they are within the specifications for the final product. Testing is done to determine if there is any need for corrective actions in the manufacturing process. Good quality control helps companies meet consumer demands for better products.
Quality testing is generally completed in each step of a
manufacturing
or business process. Employees often begin by testing
raw materials
, pulling samples from the manufacturing line, and testing the finished product. Testing at various manufacturing stages helps identify where a production problem occurs and the remedial steps required to prevent it in the future.
In a nonmanufacturing business, quality testing can involve
customer service
evaluations, questionnaires, surveys, inspections, or audits. A business can use any process or method to verify that its end product or service meets the customer’s needs and is safe and legal.
Fast Fact
Limiting room for error by specifying which production activities are to be completed by which personnel reduces the chance that employees will be involved in tasks for which they do not have adequate training.
How Quality Controls Differ by Industry
QC used in a business is highly dependent on the product or
industry
. There may be different processes and regulations that apply. For example:
Quality control in food and drug manufacturing includes ensuring the product does not make a consumer sick, so the company performs chemical and microbiological testing of samples from the production or
assembly line
.
In automobile manufacturing, quality control focuses on parts meeting specifications and tolerances. QC ensures engines, drivetrains, and other mechanical parts operate smoothly, efficiently, safely, and as designed.
In electronics, quality testing might involve using meters that measure the flow of electricity and
stress testing
.
In aircraft manufacturing, quality control is extremely important. Manufacturers must document, track, inspect, and reinspect all items and phases of a build to build evidence that everything is completed to very strict standards.
Quality Control vs. Quality Assurance
Quality control and quality assurance (QA) are terms often used to define the same thing, but there are distinct differences. Quality control focuses on quality requirements, such as ensuring a part meets specifications. Quality assurance, on the other hand, refers to the sum of all actions and processes needed to demonstrate that quality requirements are fulfilled.
What this difference means for quality professionals is that as you move through a quality control career, you might transition from quality control to quality assurance. Quality control is part of quality assurance, which consists of programs and departments that assure upper-level management, customers, and government inspectors that products meet all quality
requirements and safety standards
.
Quality Control Methods
There are several methods quality control uses to communicate and track inspections and issues. For instance, a
quality control chart
is a graphic that depicts whether sampled products or processes are meeting their intended specifications—and, if not, the degree by which they vary from those specifications.
When one chart analyzes a specific product attribute, it is called a univariate chart. A chart that measures variances in several product attributes is called a multivariate chart. Tracking variances allows businesses to see how many defects per production unit they produce and what types of defects are occurring. Here are a few examples of some methods used.
X-bar Chart
Randomly selected products are tested for the given attributes the chart is tracking. A common form of a quality control chart is the X-bar chart, where the y-axis on the graph tracks the degree to which the variance of the tested attribute is acceptable. The x-axis tracks the samples tested. Analyzing the variance pattern on this chart helps you determine if defects are occurring randomly or systematically.
Taguchi Method
The
Taguchi method
is another approach to quality control that emphasizes the roles of
research and development (R&D)
, product design, and product development in reducing the occurrence of defects and failures in products. This method considers design more important than the manufacturing process in quality control and tries to eliminate variances in production before they can occur.
100% Inspection Method
This 100% inspection method is a quality control process that looks at and assesses all product parts. This type of quality control is done to rule out flaws in products. It often evaluates valuable metals and calls for data about the manufacturing process and software to analyze
inventory
.
The challenge of using this method is that looking at every single item used to build a product is expensive and could destabilize or render the product unusable. For example, if you use this method to examine organic strawberries, you risk damaging the berries, rendering them unsellable.
Important
Quality control methods help standardize production and reactions to quality issues in various industries, from food production to automobile manufacturing.
Quality Control Careers
Quality control can be a rewarding career if you enjoy working with people, communicating, presenting results, and working to make products better and safer. Here’s what you may need to become one.
Requirements
To become a quality control inspector, you’ll need a high school diploma for entry-level positions and higher education for advanced jobs. Many companies prefer candidates with prior work experience in their industry. It also helps if you’re licensed or certified in your field. For instance, the American Society for Quality offers certification for quality control professionals, which can increase your earning potential.
1
2
Other qualities needed for quality control professionals are:
Attention to detail
Mechanical and math skills
Physical abilities and strength
Technical skills
Performance under pressure
Career Path
The route to a career in quality control and assurance varies by industry, so there may be differences. However, you’ll generally need several years of experience in your industry. Typically, you begin by being hired as a quality assurance or control associate after meeting educational and work experience requirements.
Once you gain work experience, you may move into a senior specialist position and begin managing teams of quality control specialists. You may attend professional development courses sponsored by your employer or be required to gain certifications such as
Six Sigma
.
3
You might also need to earn a professional designation such as Certified Quality Inspector.
4
Moving up the career path, you have more options. You may be able to choose from or be selected to be a QA systems manager, QA operations manager, or QA compliance manager. These positions can lead up to upper-level management or executive levels within quality control:
Director of quality
Head of compliance
Vice president of quality
Quality Control Salaries
The average pay for quality control professionals differs by industry, experience, and position. Pay increases as you gain more experience and move into management positions. As of May 2024, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
reports average salaries as:
5
Professional, scientific, and technical services: $50,300
Manufacturing: $48,170
Wholesale trade: $46,400
Administrative and support services: $37,490
What Does a Quality Control Inspector Do?
A quality control inspector audits and evaluates a company’s manufacturing and operational processes. They do this by monitoring products throughout the entire production process to ensure they meet the highest standards before they are put on the market. This means reviewing everything from the raw materials used to produce the goods up to the finished products.
Why Is Quality Control Important?
Quality control ensures that defective goods don’t go out to the public. Companies that have quality control methods in place often have employees who pay close attention to their work.

What Is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP)?
A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business venture in the form of a publicly traded
limited partnership
. It combines the tax benefits of a private partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded company.
A master limited partnership trades on an exchange. MLPs generally experience cash flow stability and are required by the partnership agreement to distribute a set amount of cash to their investors. Their structure can also help reduce the cost of capital in capital-intensive businesses such as the energy sector.
The first MLP was organized in 1981. However, by 1987, Congress effectively limited the use of them to the real estate and natural resources sectors. These limitations were put into place out of concern over too much lost corporate tax revenue. MLPs do not pay federal income taxes.

Key Takeaways
A master limited partnership (MLP) is a company organized as a publicly traded partnership.
MLPs combine a private partnership's tax advantages with a stock's liquidity.
MLPs have two types of partners: general partners who manage the MLP and oversee its operations, and limited partners who are investors in the MLP.
Investors receive distributions that are not double-taxed like corporate dividends.
MLPs are considered relatively low-risk, long-term investments, providing a slow but steady income stream.
Understanding Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)
The MLP is a hybrid legal entity that combines elements of two business structures—a partnership and a corporation. It is considered to be the aggregate of its partners rather than a separate legal entity (like a corporation).
An MLP technically has no employees. The general partners are responsible for providing all necessary operational services. General partners usually hold stakes of about 2% in the venture and have the option to increase their ownership.

The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
An MLP issues units instead of shares. These units can be bought and sold on stock exchanges. As a result, they are a liquid security. Traditional partnerships cannot offer the same level of
liquidity
.
Since an MLP's publicly traded units are not stock shares, those who invest in MLPs are commonly referred to as unitholders rather than shareholders. Those who buy into an MLP are called limited partners. These unitholders are allocated a share of the MLP's income, deductions, losses, and credits.
1
MLPs have two classes of partners:
Limited partners
are investors who purchase shares in the MLP and provide the capital for the entity's operations. They receive periodic distributions from the MLP, typically every quarter. Limited partners are also known as silent partners.
General partners
are the owners who are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the MLP. They receive compensation based on the partnership's business performance.
Tax Treatment of MLPs
Pass-Through Tax Consequences
An MLP is treated as a limited partnership for tax purposes, which is a significant
tax advantage
for investors.
A limited partnership has a pass-through, or flow-through, tax structure. This means that all profits and losses are passed through to the limited partners. The MLP itself pays no taxes on its profits, unlike corporations. Instead, the limited partners
pay income taxes on their portions
of the MLP's earnings.
4
1
Further, deductions, such as depreciation and depletion, also pass through to the limited partners. Limited partners can use these deductions to reduce their taxable income.
5
To maintain its pass-through status, at least 90% of the MLP's income must be qualifying income. Qualifying income includes income realized from the exploration, production, or transportation of natural resources or real estate.
In other words, to qualify as a master limited partnership, a company must generate all but 10% of its revenues from natural resources or real estate activities. This definition of qualifying income reduces the sectors in which MLPs can operate.
6
Deferred Taxes and the Capital Gains Tax Rate
Quarterly distributions from the MLP are not unlike quarterly stock dividends. However, a portion of a distribution is treated as a
return of capital
(ROC) rather than dividend income. So, the unitholder does not pay income tax on the distribution. Instead, the distribution reduces the cost basis of units.
7
The distributions remain tax-deferred until unitholders sell their interests in the MLP. Then, the difference between the cost basis and sale price is taxed at a combination of the ordinary income tax rate (on the return of capital distribution) and the capital gains tax rate (on the appreciation of the units since purchase). This is
a significant, additional tax benefit
.
7
8
Fast Fact
MLPs are taxed as partnerships, not corporations, so their profits are not subject to the
double taxation
that corporations face. Corporations pay corporate tax and then the shareholders must pay personal taxes on the income from their holdings.
9
Advantages and Disadvantages of MLPs
Like any investment, MLPs have their pros and cons.
Advantages
MLPs are known for offering slow yet steady investment returns. The slow returns stem from the fact that MLPs are often in slow-growing industries like pipeline construction. This slow but steady growth means MLPs are relatively low risk. They earn a stable income often based on long-term service contracts.
MLPs offer steady cash flows
and consistent cash distributions.
The cash distributions of MLPs usually grow slightly faster than inflation. For limited partners, there is also the tax benefits associated with return of capital. Overall, this lets MLPs offer attractive income yields—often substantially higher than the average dividend yield of equities. Also, with the flow-through entity status (and the absence of double taxation), more capital is available for future projects. The availability of capital keeps the MLP competitive in its industry.
9
7
Further, for the limited partner, cumulative cash distributions could exceed the portion taxed at the capital gains rate once units are sold.
Limited partners' liability for an MLP's debts and obligations is capped at the amount of their capital contribution.
Until the 2017 tax cuts act benefit expires in 2025, investors can deduct 20% of their distributions from their taxable income, reducing the tax they would otherwise pay.
7
10
There are benefits to using MLPs for
estate planning
. When unitholders gift or transfer the MLP units to beneficiaries, both unitholders and beneficiaries avoid paying taxes during the time of transfer. The cost basis will readjust based on the market price during the time of the transfer if the transfer happens because of death. There is no step-up in basis if the MLP's units are gifted. Should the unitholder die and the investment pass to their heirs, the units pass tax-free, and the fair market value is determined to be the value as of the date of death.
11
12
Disadvantages
MLPs are tax-efficient for investors but the filing requirements are complex. An MLP’s income, deductions, credits, and other items are detailed each year on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
Schedule K-1
form that is sent to the investor. The K-1 can be complicated and create extra work for investors or the tax professionals they hire.
4
MLP investors are required to pay state income taxes on their allocated portion of income in each state in which the MLP operates, which can be more than one. This can increase their costs.
13
Another tax-related disadvantage of MLPs is that you cannot use a net loss (more losses than profits) to offset other income. However, net losses may be carried forward to the following year. When you eventually sell all of your units, a net loss can be used as a deduction against other income.
8
14
15
MLPs have limited appreciation potential. This might be expected from an investment that should produce a gradual yet reliable income stream over several years.
Pros
Steady income
Relatively low risk
Tax-advantaged treatment
Liquidity
Limited liability for debts
Cons
Complex tax-filing
Limited capital appreciation
Limited to two sectors: real estate and natural resources

Definition
Form 10-K is a required annual filing where a company details its financial situation and circumstances for the prior year.
What Is Form 10-K?
Form 10-K is an annual financial report that publicly-traded companies must file with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
. Some of the data required in a 10-K includes the company's history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and other relevant data.
Key Takeaways
The 10-K is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is far more detailed than the annual report.
Information in the 10-K includes corporate history, financial statements, earnings per share, and any other relevant data.
The 10-K is a useful tool for investors to make important decisions about their investments.
A company's Form 10-K can be found on the SEC's EDGAR database and on the company's investor relations website.
Investopedia / Yurle Villegas
Understanding Form 10-K
Because of the depth and nature of the information they contain,
10-Ks
are fairly long and tend to be complicated. But
investors
need to understand that this is one of the most comprehensive and most important documents a public company can publish on a yearly basis. The more information they can gather from the 10-K, the more they can understand the company. Canadian companies will file
SEC Form 40-F
to provide this information.
The government requires companies to publish 10-K forms so investors have accurate information and can make informed investment decisions. This form gives a clearer picture of everything a company does and what kinds of risks it faces.
Important
Most companies publish their 10-Ks and other required filings on the Investor Relations section of their website. You can also find them using the company search function through the SEC's EDGAR database.
1
The 10-K includes five distinct sections:
Business
.
This provides an overview of the company’s main operations, including its products and services (i.e., how it makes money).
Risk factors
.
These outline any and all risks the company faces or may face in the future. The risks are typically listed in order of importance.
Selected financial data
.
This section details specific financial information about the company over the last five years. This section presents more of a near-term view of the company’s recent performance.
Management’s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations. Also known as
MD&A
, this gives the company an opportunity to explain its business results from the previous fiscal year. This section is where the company can tell its story in its own words.
Financial statements and supplementary data
.
This includes the company’s audited financial statements including the income statement,
balance sheets
, and statement of cash flows. A letter from the company’s independent auditor certifying the scope of their review is also included in this section.

A 10-K filing also includes signed letters from the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. In it, the executives swear under oath that the information included in the 10-K is accurate.
3
These letters became required after several high-profile accounting fraud cases followed the dot-com bust.
4
10-K Filings and Deadlines
10-K filings are public information and readily available through a number of sources. In fact, the vast majority of companies include them in the
Investor Relations
section of their website. The information included in a 10-K can be difficult to move through, but the more familiar investors become with the layout and the type of information included, the easier it is to identify the most important details.
Filing deadlines for the 10-K vary based on the size of the company. According to the SEC, companies with a public
float
—shares issued to the public that are available to trade—of $700 million or more must file their 10-K within 60 days after the end of their fiscal year. Companies with a float between $75 million and $700 million have 75 days, while companies with less than $75 million in their float have 90 days.
5
Purpose of Form 10-K
The primary purpose of filing a Form 10-K is to provide comprehensive, transparent information about how a company is doing. Because this information is useful to a variety of people, the SEC requires certain information to be presented in a certain way. At a very high level, it’s fair to say Form 10-K’s purpose can be broken down into the following five categories (which slightly overlap but are more high-level than the five categories listed above):
Transparency
: It offers
transparency
into a company's financial health, including its financial statements, risks, and opportunities.
Disclosure
: It requires companies to disclose relevant information about their business operations, management, and financial condition, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
Compliance
: It ensures
compliance
with SEC regulations and provides a standardized format for reporting financial information, promoting consistency and comparability among companies.
Accountability
: It holds company management accountable to shareholders by providing a detailed overview of the company's performance and strategic direction.
Investor Confidence
: It helps build investor confidence by demonstrating the company's commitment to transparency and corporate governance practices.
Fast Fact
Form 10-K is prescribed by the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.
5
Who Files Form 10-K
Form 10-K is required to be filed by all
publicly traded companies
in the United States. This requirement applies to companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange.
6
The SEC imposes this filing requirement to ensure transparency and accountability in the financial markets, allowing investors and other stakeholders to access relevant information about the company's operations, financial condition, and performance.
7
The filing of Form 10-K is not limited to
large corporations
; it applies to companies of all sizes that meet the criteria for being publicly traded. This includes both domestic and foreign companies whose securities are listed on U.S. exchanges or are registered with the SEC. Additionally, certain smaller reporting companies may file a streamlined version of the Form 10-K, known as Form 10-KSB or Form 10-KT.
8
Note that in order to file this alternative version, a company has to meet some eligibility requirements.
Fast Fact
Form 10-K is only used for U.S. companies trading on U.S. exchanges. If a foreign company lists its shares on a U.S. exchange, it files
Form 20-F
.
Penalties for Form 10-K Noncompliance
There are penalties for not filing a Form 10-K on time. These penalties can vary depending on the severity of the violation and the circumstances surrounding the late filing. In most cases, companies pay a fee for non-compliance.
9
Failure to file required periodic reports can result in the loss of good standing with stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies. This could lead to delisting from stock exchanges or temporary suspensions of 10
trading days
.
10
In addition, the SEC may take legal and regulatory actions against companies that repeatedly fail to meet filing deadlines or comply with disclosure requirements. These actions can include enforcement proceedings, investigations, fines, and sanctions against the company, its officers, directors, or other responsible parties.
11
On the softer side of the consequences, late or incomplete filings can erode investor confidence and trust in the company's management. Investors may perceive delayed filings as a red flag indicating potential financial problems, lack of transparency, or poor internal controls. There’s little reason for a Form 10-K to be filed late, and investors may (and probably should) be curious about the reasons behind any non-compliance.
Limitations of Form 10-K
While Form 10-K reports a wealth of useful information, it does have its downsides. These limitations include but aren’t necessarily limited to:
Forward-Looking Statements
: Companies often include forward-looking statements in their Form 10-K, which are statements about future expectations, plans, or

Definition
Utility is an economic term used to measure the value a good or service brings to a consumer.
What Is Utility?
Utility is the total satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service. Economic theories based on
rational choice
assume that consumers will strive to maximize their utility. The utility of a good or service directly influences an item's demand and its price. Economic models try to quantify or estimate utility to determine consumer decision-making.
Key Takeaways
Measuring utility helps explain how and why consumers make their decisions.
""Ordinal"" utility assumes one good is more useful or desirable than another.
""Cardinal"" utility measures economic value through imaginary units known as ""utils.""
""Marginal"" utility is what is gained by consuming an additional unit of a service or good.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
Utility Theory
The utility definition in
economics
relates to the concept of usefulness. An economic good yields utility to the extent to which it's useful for satisfying a consumer’s want or need. Various schools of thought differ as to how to model economic utility and measure the usefulness of a good or service.
Early economists of the Spanish Scholastic tradition of the 1300s and 1400s described the economic value of goods as deriving directly from this property of usefulness and based their theories on prices and monetary exchanges.
1
Utility in economics was first coined by the noted 18th-century Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli. To
Bernoulli
and other economists, utility was modeled as a quantifiable or cardinal property of the economic goods that a person consumes.
2
Important
Economic utility can be estimated by observing a consumer's choice between similar products. However, measuring utility becomes challenging as more variables or differences are present between the choices.
3
Measuring Utility
Ordinal Utility
: Economists of the
Austrian School
developed the ordinal theory of utility, the idea that individuals order or rank the usefulness of various units of economic goods.
4
Carl Menger
used this framework to resolve the
diamond-water paradox
: the first available units of any economic good will be put to the most highly valued uses, and subsequent units go to lower-valued uses. The ordinal theory of utility explains the law of diminishing marginal utility and the fundamental
laws of supply and demand
.
5
In ordinal utility terms, a person with three slices of pizza might eat the first, share the second slice with a friend, and waste the third.
Cardinal Utility
: Assumes a “util” represents the amount of satisfaction a specific good or service generates for a subset of people in various situations. The concept of a measurable ""util"" makes it possible to treat economic theory and relationships using mathematical symbols and calculations. However, “utils” cannot be observed, measured, or compared between different economic goods or between individuals.
3
For example, if economists determine that a piece of pizza yields 10 utils and a bowl of pasta yields 12 utils, individuals will know that eating the pasta will be more satisfying. Producers of pizza and pasta will then price pasta higher than pizza.
Total Utility
: If utility in economics is cardinal and measurable, the
total utility (TU)
is the sum of the satisfaction that a person receives from the consumption of all units of a specific product or service. Using the example above, if a person can only consume three slices of pizza and the first slice of pizza consumed yields ten utils, the second slice of pizza consumed yields eight utils, and the third slice yields two utils, the total utility of pizza would be twenty utils.
Marginal Utility
: This is defined as the additional (cardinal) utility gained from the consumption of one additional unit of a good or service or the additional (ordinal) use that a person has for an additional unit. Using the same example, if the economic utility of the first slice of pizza is ten utils and the utility of the second slice is eight utils, the
marginal utility (MU)
of eating the second slice is eight utils. If the utility of a third slice is two utils, the MU of eating that third slice is two utils.
Why Is It Difficult to Accurately Measure Utility?
There is no direct way to measure the utility of a certain good for each consumer, but economists may estimate utility through indirect observation. For example, if a consumer is willing to spend $1 for a bottle of water but not $1.50, economists may surmise that a bottle of water has economic utility somewhere between $1 and $1.50. However, this becomes difficult in practice because of the number of variables in a typical consumer's choices.
What Assumptions Do Economists Make About Consumer Decision-Making?
Economists assume that consumers seek to maximize their utility and are motivated by a specific need, such as happiness, wealth, or generosity.
6
How Is Consumer Spending Affected by Utility?
Suppose ""utils"" are used to measure consumer demand. A first slice of pizza may yield 10 utils, but as more pizza is consumed, the utils may decrease as an individual becomes full. This process reveals that consumers may maximize their utility by allocating their money between multiple types of goods and services.
The Bottom Line
Utility can be used to measure the usefulness of goods and services to consumers. While there are limitations when more variables and differences appear in the market, various types of economic utility are identified. Measuring utility helps companies structure pricing based on the laws of demand. Utility is a term also used to describe the services consumers receive from energy companies, such as electricity.

Definition
A feasibility study is a comprehensive analysis of the practicality and potential success of a proposed project that assesses costs, benefits, risks, and necessary resources.
What Is a Feasibility Study?
A feasibility study is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed plan or project. It analyzes the viability of a project to determine whether the project or venture is likely to succeed. The study is also designed to identify potential issues and problems that could arise while pursuing the project.
Key Takeaways
A feasibility study assesses the potential for success of a proposed plan or project by defining its expected costs and projected benefits in detail.
A company may conduct a feasibility study when it’s considering launching a new business, adding a new product line, or acquiring a rival.
It’s a good idea to have a contingency plan on hand in case the original project is found to be infeasible.
Lara Antal / Investopedia
Understanding Feasibility Studies
As part of the feasibility study, project managers must determine whether they have the right people, financial resources, and technology. The study must also determine the
return on investment
(ROI), whether this is measured as a financial gain or a benefit to society.
The feasibility study might include a
cash flow
analysis, measuring the level of cash generated from
revenue
vs. the project’s
operating costs
. A
risk assessment
must also be completed to determine whether the return is enough to offset the risk of undergoing the venture.
Tip
When doing a feasibility study, it’s good to have a contingency plan to test as a viable alternative if the first plan fails.
Benefits of Feasibility Studies
Feasibility studies help project managers discern the pros and cons of undertaking a project before their business or organization invests a significant amount of time and
capital
.
Feasibility studies can also provide a company’s management team with crucial information that could prevent them from entering into a
risky
business venture.
Such studies help companies determine how they will grow. They will know more about how they will operate, what the potential obstacles are, who the competition is, and what the market is.
Feasibility studies also help convince investors and bankers that investing in a particular project or business is a wise decision.
How to Conduct a Feasibility Study
The exact format of a feasibility study will depend on the type of business or organization that requires it. However, the same factors will be involved even if their weighting varies.
Preliminary Analysis
Although each project can have unique goals and needs, there are some best practices for conducting any feasibility study.
Conduct a preliminary analysis, which involves getting feedback about the new concept from the appropriate stakeholders.
Analyze and ask questions about the data obtained in the early phase of the study to make sure that it’s solid.
Conduct a market survey or market research to identify the market demand and opportunity for pursuing the project or business.
Write an organizational, operational, or business plan. Identify the cost of the labor needed, and how long it will be needed for.
Prepare a projected
income statement,
which includes revenue, operating costs, and
profit
.
Prepare an opening day
balance sheet
.
Identify obstacles and any potential vulnerabilities, as well as how to deal with them.
Make an initial “go” or “no-go” decision about moving ahead with the plan.
Suggested Components
Once the initial
due diligence
has been completed, the real work begins. Components that are typically found in a feasibility study include the following.
Executive Summary
: Formulate a narrative describing the details of the project, product, service, plan, or business.
Technological Considerations
: Ask what it will take. Do you have it? If not, can you get it? What will it cost?
Existing Marketplace
: Examine the local and broader markets for the product, service, plan, or business.
Marketing Strategy
: Describe it in detail.
Required Staffing
: What are the
human capital
needs for this project? Draw up an organizational chart.
Schedule and Timeline
: Include significant interim markers and the project’s completion date.
Project Financials:
Be thorough.
Findings and Recommendations
: Break these down into subsets of technology, marketing, organization, and financials.
Examples of Feasibility Studies
Below are two examples of feasibility studies. The first involves expansion plans for a university. The second is a real-world example conducted by the Washington State Department of Transportation with private contributions from Microsoft Inc.
A University Science Building
Officials at a university are concerned that their science building—built in the 1970s—is outdated. They want to explore the cost and benefits of upgrading and expanding the building. So they conduct a feasibility study.
In the preliminary analysis, school officials explore several options, weighing the benefits and costs of expanding and updating the science building. Some school officials have concerns about the project, primarily about the cost and possible community opposition. The feasibility study needs to address these concerns and other issues, like zoning.
The feasibility study must also explore the technological needs of the new science facility and the benefits to the students. A modernized science facility would expand the school’s scientific research capabilities, potentially attracting new faculty and students.
Financial projections show the cost and scope of the project and how the school plans to raise the needed funds, which includes issuing a
bond
to investors and tapping into the school’s
endowment
. The projections also show how the expanded facility would expand student enrollment in the sciences, increasing revenue from tuition and fees.
The feasibility study demonstrates that the project is viable. The plan to modernize and expand the science building is given the green light.
Without conducting a feasibility study, the school administrators would never have known whether its plans were viable.
A High-Speed Rail Project
In this real-world example, the Washington State Department of Transportation decided to conduct a feasibility study on a proposal to construct a high-speed rail line that would connect Vancouver, British Columbia, Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. The goal was to create an environmentally responsible transportation system to enhance the competitiveness and future prosperity of the Pacific Northwest.
1
The preliminary analysis
outlined a governance framework for future decision-making. To research the most effective framework, study leaders interviewed experts and stakeholders, reviewed governance structures, and researched other high-speed rail projects.
2
A strategic engagement plan
used an equitable approach with the public, elected officials, federal agencies, business leaders, advocacy groups, and Indigenous communities. The engagement plan was designed to be flexible, considering the size and scope of the project and how many cities and towns would be involved. A team of executive committee members formed to discuss strategies and lessons learned from other projects. The team met with experts to create an outreach framework.
The financial component
of the feasibility study outlined the strategy for securing the project’s funding, which explored obtaining funds from federal, state, and private investments. The project’s cost was estimated to be $24 billion to $42 billion. The revenue generated from the high-speed rail system was estimated to be $160 million to $250 million.
3
The report bifurcated the money sources between funding and financing. Funding referred to grants, appropriations from the local or state government, and revenue. Financing referred to bonds issued by the government, loans from financial institutions, and equity investments, which are essentially loans against future revenue that need to be paid back with
interest
.
The sources for the capital needed would vary as the project moved forward. In the early stages, most of the funding would come from the government, and as the project developed, funding would come from private contributions and financing measures. Private contributors included Microsoft Inc.
The benefits outlined in the feasibility report
show that the region would experience enhanced interconnectivity, allowing for better management of the population and increasing regional economic growth by $355 billion. The new transportation system would provide people with access to better jobs and mo",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/feasibility-study.asp
Investopedia,Applicable Federal Rate (AFR): What It Is and How To Use It,"Close
What Is the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR)?
According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), private loans must charge a minimum interest rate known as the applicable federal rate (AFR), published monthly by the IRS. Since private
loans
can vary by term length, the IRA publishes several AFRs by loan type.
1
Key Takeaways
Applicable federal rates (AFR) are an interest rate index published monthly by the IRS.
Lenders use AFRs to determine how much interest to charge on below-market loans.
Personal loans must have an interest rate at least the same as the applicable AFR, or the borrower will be charged additional taxes.
How the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) Is Determined by the IRS
The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
uses the applicable federal rate (AFR) to help people initiating personal loans determine whether they're charging enough interest. If not, both the
lender
and borrower could be liable for additional
taxes
and penalties.
Typically, a lender, such as a
bank
or
credit union
, would issue a loan at an
interest rate
high enough to cover the cost of processing the loan and earn a profit. The loan rate also includes the embedded risk of lending to the borrower.
However, when family members lend to one another, they might issue a loan at a below-market rate in an effort to help their family members. However, the IRS mandates a minimum interest rate that must be applied to a private
loan
—the applicable federal rate (AFR).
People interested in taking out a
personal loan
should review the AFR to see if they're charging or paying enough interest. For example, if you're making a
personal loan
to a family member, check that you're charging at least the AFR, or you'll get hit with a tax bill for the interest the IRS believes you should have received for the loan.
To determine the monthly AFR, the IRS considers a number of economic factors, like U.S. Treasury obligations from the previous month. It publishes these rates under Section 1274(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code
.
2
Types of Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs)
When you pull up the monthly applicable federal rate (AFR), you'll see several rates listed based on
loan type
. In other words, you apply a different rate depending on the length of the loan.
Short-term AFR: Loans with a term of three years or less
Mid-term AFR: Loans with a term of four to nine years
Long-term AFR: Loans with a term of over nine years
The U.S. Treasury Department determines the AFRs for each term based on the average yields for marketable debt securities with similar maturities.
3
Important
When you pull up the AFR rates, you'll also see various compounding interest periods (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly).
How to Use the AFR When Loaning Money
The easiest way to understand AFR is by providing an example of when most people will encounter the term.
Below Market Rate
Imagine you loaned money to a family member but didn't charge them interest. If the IRS learns you didn't charge interest, the IRS would tax the interest you earned, but the amount of interest would count toward your
tax-free gift
limit for the year.
4
To avoid surprises when you file your taxes, use the AFR index published the month you provided your family member the loan. To find which rate to use, you'd consider the length of the loan: short-term (three years or less), mid-term (four to nine years), and long-term (more than nine years).
3
Loan at the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR)
Let's say that you're loaning your sister $10,000 to be repaid within one year. Since the
loan
term is three years or less, you would use the annual short-term AFR. As a result, your sister would pay you 4.16% based on the AFR as of April 2025. In other words, your sister would pay you $416 in interest by the end of the year.
1
If you charge your sister a rate less than 4.16% (the published AFR for your loan terms), you trigger a taxable event, meaning the $416 you earned would be considered
taxable income
. The IRS might also impose penalties.
The Bottom Line
Paying attention to and charging the applicable federal rate might seem like just one extra step to complicate what should be a simple loan between a few people. However, the IRS uses the AFR to determine whether the interest charged is a
gift
or part of a loan. As a result, it's important to reference the AFR so you know how much interest to charge for a personal loan, or you'll be on the hook for additional taxes and penalties.

What Is an American Depositary Receipt (ADR)?
American depositary receipts (ADRs) are negotiable certificates issued by a U.S. depositary bank representing a specified number of shares—usually one share—of a foreign company's stock. The ADR trades on U.S. stock markets as any domestic shares would.
ADRs offer U.S. investors a way to purchase stock in overseas companies that would not otherwise be available. Foreign firms also benefit, as ADRs enable them to attract American investors and capital without the hassle and expense of listing on U.S. stock exchanges.
Key Takeaways
An American depositary receipt is a certificate issued by a U.S. bank that represents shares in foreign stock.
These certificates trade on American stock exchanges.
ADRs and their dividends are priced in U.S. dollars.
ADRs represent an easy, liquid way for U.S. investors to own foreign stocks.
These investments may open investors up to double taxation, and a limited number of options are available.
Investopedia / Tara Anand
How American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) Work
American depositary receipts are denominated in U.S. dollars. The
underlying security
is held by a U.S. financial institution, often by an overseas branch. These securities are priced and traded in dollars and cleared through U.S. settlement systems.
To begin offering ADRs, a U.S. bank must purchase shares on a foreign exchange. The bank holds the stock as inventory and issues an ADR for domestic trading. ADRs can be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq, and
over-the-counter
(OTC).
1
U.S. banks require that foreign companies provide them with detailed financial information. This requirement makes it easier for American investors to assess a company's financial health.

Types of American Depositary Receipts
American depositary receipts come in two basic categories:
Sponsored ADRs
A bank issues a
sponsored
ADR on behalf of the foreign company. The bank and the business enter into a legal arrangement. The foreign company usually pays the costs of issuing an ADR and retains control, while the bank handles the transactions with investors. Sponsored ADRs are categorized by what degree the foreign company complies with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and American accounting procedures.
1
Unsponsored ADRs
A bank also issues an
unsponsored
ADR. However, this certificate has no direct involvement, participation, or even permission from the foreign company. Theoretically, several unsponsored ADRs for the same foreign company could be issued by different U.S. banks. These different offerings may also offer varying dividends. With sponsored programs, only one ADR is issued by the bank working with the foreign company.
One primary difference between the two types of ADRs is where they trade. All except the lowest level of sponsored ADRs register with the SEC and trade on major U.S. stock exchanges. Unsponsored ADRs will trade only over the counter. Unsponsored ADRs never include voting rights.
1
2,000+
The number of ADRs available, which represent companies from more than 70 different countries.
1
ADR Levels
ADRs are additionally categorized into three levels, depending on the extent to which the foreign company has accessed the U.S. markets.
Level I
This is the most basic type of ADR, where foreign companies either don't qualify or don't want their ADR listed on an exchange. This type of ADR can be used to establish a trading presence but not to raise capital.
Level I ADRs found only on the over-the-counter market have the loosest requirements from the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) and are typically highly speculative. While they are riskier for investors than other types of ADRs, they are an easy and inexpensive way for a foreign company to gauge the level of U.S. investor interest in its securities.
Level II
As with Level I ADRs, Level II ADRs can be used to establish a trading presence on a stock exchange and can’t be used to raise
capital
. Level II ADRs have slightly more requirements from the SEC than Level I ADRs, but they get higher visibility and trading volume.
Level III
Level III ADRs are the most prestigious. With these, an issuer floats a
public offering
of ADRs on a U.S. exchange. They can be used to establish a substantial trading presence in the U.S. financial markets and raise capital for the foreign issuer. Issuers are subject to full reporting with the SEC.
1
American Depositary Receipt Pricing and Costs
An ADR may represent the underlying shares on a one-for-one basis, a fraction of a share, or multiple shares of the underlying company.
1
The depositary bank will set the ratio of U.S. ADRs per home-country share at a value that they feel will appeal to investors. If an ADR's value is too high, it may deter some investors. Conversely, if it is too low, investors may think the underlying securities resemble riskier
penny stocks
.
Because of
arbitrage
, an ADR's price closely tracks that of the company's stock on its home exchange. Remember that arbitrage is buying and selling the same asset at the same time in different markets. This allows traders to profit from differences in the asset's listed price.
ADR Fees
Investing in an ADR may incur additional fees that are not charged for domestic stocks. The depositary bank that holds the underlying stock may charge a fee, known as a custody fee, to cover the cost of creating and issuing an ADR.
This fee will be outlined in the ADR prospectus and typically ranges from one to three cents per share. The fee will be either deducted from dividends or passed on to the investor's brokerage firm.
ADRs and Taxes
Holders of ADRs realize any
dividends
and
capital gains
in U.S. dollars. However, dividend payments are net of currency conversion expenses and foreign taxes. Usually, the bank automatically withholds the necessary amount to cover expenses and foreign taxes.
2
Since this is the practice, American investors would need to seek a credit from the IRS or a refund from the foreign government's taxing authority to avoid double taxation on any capital gains realized.
3
Tip
If you're interested in learning more about ADRs, there are many investing courses available that can get you started.
Advantages and Disadvantages of American Depositary Receipts
As with any investment, there are distinct advantages and disadvantages of investing in ADRs. Here are some of them.
Advantages
ADRs are just like stocks. This means they trade on a stock exchange or over the counter, making them fairly easy to access and trade. Investors can also easily track their performance by reviewing market data.
Purchasing ADRs is easy because they're available directly through American
brokers
. This eliminates the need to go through foreign channels to buy stock in a company you may be interested in. Since they're available domestically, shares are
denominated
in U.S. dollars. But that doesn't mean you avoid any direct risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates.
Warning
It is a common misconception that since the ADR is traded in U.S. dollars in the United States, there is no exchange rate risk. ADRs have currency risk because of the way they are structured. The global bank that creates the ADRs establishes a conversion rate, meaning that an ADR share is worth a certain number of local shares. To preserve this conversion rate over time, movements in the exchange rate of the home country vs. the ADR price must be reflected in U.S. dollars.
One of the most obvious benefits of investing in ADRs is that they provide investors with a way to diversify their
portfolios
. Investing in international securities allows you to open your investment portfolio up to greater rewards (along with the risks).
Disadvantages
The main problems associated with ADRs are that they may involve
double taxation
—locally and abroad—and how many companies are listed. Unlike domestic companies, there are a limited number of foreign entities whose ADRs are listed for the public to trade.
Some ADRs may not comply with SEC regulations. These are called unsponsored ADRs, which have no direct involvement by the company. In fact, some companies may not even provide permission to list their shares this way.

What Is Business-to-Consumer (B2C)?
The term business-to-consumer (B2C) refers to the process of selling products and services directly between a business and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. Most companies that sell directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies.
B2C became immensely popular during the
dotcom
boom of the late 1990s when it was mainly used to refer to online retailers who sold products and services to consumers through the internet.
As a business model, business-to-consumer differs significantly from the
business-to-business
(B2B) model, which refers to commerce between two or more businesses.
Key Takeaways
Business-to-consumer refers to the process of businesses selling products and services directly to consumers, with no middle person.
B2C typically refers to online retailers who sell products and services to consumers through the internet.
Online B2C became a threat to traditional retailers, who profited from adding a markup to the price.
However, companies like Amazon, eBay, and Priceline have thrived, ultimately becoming industry disruptors.
Business to Consumer (B2C)
Understanding Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
Business-to-consumer (B2C) is among the most popular and widely known sales models. Michael Aldrich first utilized the idea of B2C in 1979 and used television as the primary medium to reach out to consumers.
1
B2C traditionally referred to mall shopping, eating out at restaurants, pay-per-view movies, and infomercials. However, the rise of the internet created a whole new B2C business channel in the form of
e-commerce
or selling goods and services over the internet.
Although many B2C companies fell victim to the subsequent dotcom bust as investor interest in the sector dwindled and venture capital funding dried up, B2C leaders such as Amazon and Priceline survived the shakeout and have since seen tremendous success.
Any business that relies on B2C sales must maintain good relations with its
customers
to ensure they return. The company must
regularly review its marketing
for good performance and adjust it when necessary.
Business-to-business (B2B) marketing campaigns are geared to demonstrate the value of a product or service. Companies that rely on B2C usually
try to catch the eye of the consumer
and elicit an emotional response to their marketing.
B2C Storefronts vs. Internet Retailers
Traditionally, many manufacturers sold their products to retailers with physical locations. Retailers made profits on the markup they added to the price paid to the manufacturer. But that changed once the
internet
came. New businesses arose that promised to sell directly to the
consumer
, thus cutting out the middle person—the retailer—and lowering prices. During the bust of the dotcom boom in the 1990s, businesses fought to secure a web presence. Many retailers were forced to shut their doors and went out of business.
Decades after the dotcom revolution, B2C companies with a web presence continue to dominate over their traditional brick-and-mortar competitors. Companies such as Amazon, Priceline, and eBay are survivors of the early dotcom boom. They have gone on to expand upon their early success to become industry disruptors.
Fast Fact
Online B2C can be broken down into five categories: direct sellers, online intermediaries, advertising-based B2C, community-based, and fee-based.
B2C in the Digital World
There are typically five types of online B2C business models that most companies use online to target consumers.
1. Direct sellers.
This is the most common model in which people buy goods from online retailers. These may include
manufacturers
or small businesses or simply online versions of department stores that sell products from different manufacturers.
2. Online intermediaries.
These are liaisons or go-betweens who don't actually own products or services that put buyers and sellers together. Sites like Expedia, trivago, and Etsy fall into this category.
3. Advertising-based B2C.
This model uses free content to get visitors to a website. Those visitors, in turn, come across digital or online ads. Large volumes of web traffic are used to sell advertising, which sells goods and services. One example is media sites like HuffPost, a high-traffic site that mixes advertising with its native content.
4. Community-based.
Sites like Meta (formerly Facebook), which build online communities based on shared interests, help marketers and advertisers promote their products directly to consumers. Websites typically target ads based on users' demographics and geographical location.
5. Fee-based.
Direct-to-consumer sites like Netflix charge a fee so consumers can access their content. The site may also offer free but limited content while charging for most of it. The
New York Times
and other large newspapers often use a fee-based B2C business model.
B2C Companies and Mobile
Decades after the e-commerce boom, B2C companies are continuing to eye a growing market: mobile purchasing. With
smartphone
apps and traffic growing year-over-year, B2C companies have shifted attention to mobile users and capitalized on this popular technology.
2
Throughout the early 2010s, B2C companies were rushing to develop mobile apps, just as they were with websites decades earlier. In short, success in a B2C model is predicated on continuously evolving with consumers' appetites, opinions, trends, and desires.
Important
Because of the nature of the purchases and relationships between businesses, sales in the B2B model may take longer than those in the B2C model.
B2C vs. B2B
As mentioned above, the business-to-consumer model differs from the business-to-business (B2B) model. While consumers buy products for their personal use, businesses buy products to use for their companies. Large purchases, such as
capital equipment
, generally require approval from those who head up a company. This makes a business' purchasing power more complex than that of the average consumer.
Unlike the B2C business model, pricing structures tend to be different in the B2B model. With B2C, consumers often pay the same price for the same products. However, prices are not necessarily the same. Businesses tend to negotiate prices and payment terms.
What Is Business-to-Consumer and How Does It Differ From Business-to-Business?
After surging in popularity in the 1990s, business-to-consumer (B2C) increasingly became a term that referred to companies with consumers as their end-users. This stands in contrast to business-to-business (B2B), or companies whose primary clients are other businesses. B2C companies operate on the internet and sell products to customers online. Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Walmart are some examples of B2C companies.
What Is an Example of a Business-to-Consumer Company?
One example of a major B2C company today is Shopify, which has developed a platform for small retailers to sell their products and reach a broader audience online. Before the advent of the internet, however, business-to-consumer was a term that was used to describe take-out restaurants, or companies in a mall, for instance. In 1979, Michael Aldrich further utilized this term to attract consumers through television.
1
What Are the 5 Types of Business-to-Consumer Models?
Typically, B2C models fall into the following five categories: direct sellers, online intermediaries, advertising-based B2C, community-based, and fee-based. The most frequently occurring is the direct seller model, where goods are purchased directly from online retailers. By contrast, an online intermediary model would include companies like Expedia, which connect buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, a fee-based model includes services such as Disney+, which charges a subscription to stream their video-on-demand content.
The Bottom Line
B2C, or the business-to-consumer model, refers to companies that sell directly to their consumers, without going through retailers or other intermediaries. B2C sales originally relied on television advertisements to reach consumers, and gained greater prominence when the internet became widespread. B2C sales are contrasted with B2B models, in which companies direct their sales at other businesses.

What Is Globalization?
Globalization refers to the growing interconnection of nations' economies. It represents the flow of financial products, goods, technology, information, and jobs across national borders and cultures. In economic terms, it describes an interdependence of countries around the globe fostered through
free trade
.
Key Takeaways
Globalization is the spread of products, technology, information, and jobs across nations.
Corporations in developed nations can gain a competitive edge through globalization.
Developing countries also benefit from globalization as they tend to be more cost-effective locations and therefore attract jobs.
The benefits of globalization have been questioned as the positive effects are not necessarily distributed equally.
One clear result of globalization is that an economic downturn in one country can have a domino effect on its trade partners.
Alex Dos Diaz / Investopedia
Understanding Globalization
Corporations gain a
competitive advantage
on multiple fronts from globalization. They can reduce operating costs by manufacturing abroad, buy raw materials more cheaply because of the reduction or removal of
tariffs
, and most of all, gain access to millions of new consumers.
What Globalization Means
Globalization is a social, cultural, political, and legal phenomenon.
Socially, it leads to greater interaction among various populations.
Culturally, globalization represents the exchange of ideas, values, and artistic expression among cultures.
Globalization also represents a trend toward the development of a single world culture.
Politically, globalization has shifted attention to intergovernmental organizations like the
United Nations (UN)
and the
World Trade Organization (WTO)
.
Legally, globalization has altered how international law is created and enforced.
On the one hand, globalization has created new jobs and economic growth through the cross-border flow of goods, capital, and labor. On the other hand, this growth and job creation are not distributed evenly across industries or countries.

Specific industries in certain countries, such as textile manufacturing in the United States or corn farming in Mexico, have suffered severe disruption or outright collapse as a result of increased international competition.
Globalization's motives are idealistic, as well as opportunistic, but the development of a global free market has benefited large corporations based in the Western world. Its impact remains mixed for workers, cultures, and small businesses around the globe, in both developed and
emerging nations
.
Important
Globalization has grown at an unprecedented pace, with public policy changes and communications technology innovations cited as the two main driving factors.
The History of Globalization
Globalization is not a new concept. Traders traveled vast distances in ancient times to buy
commodities
that were rare and expensive for sale in their homelands. The Industrial Revolution brought advances in transportation and communication in the 19th century that eased trade across borders.
The think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) states globalization stalled after World War I. Nations moved toward
protectionism
as they launched import taxes to guard their industries in the aftermath of the conflict. This trend continued through the Great Depression and World War II until the U.S. took on an instrumental role in reviving
international trade
.
1
One of the critical steps in the path to globalization came with the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
, signed in 1993.
2
One of NAFTA's many effects was to give American auto manufacturers the incentive to relocate a portion of their manufacturing to Mexico where they could save on the costs of labor.
3
NAFTA was replaced in 2020 by the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMC)
.
4
Governments worldwide have integrated a
free market
economic system through
fiscal policies
and trade agreements in the 20th century. The core of most trade agreements is the removal or reduction of tariffs.
This evolution of economic systems has increased industrialization and financial opportunities in many nations. Governments now focus on removing barriers to trade and promoting international commerce.
Pros and Cons of Globalization
Pros
Proponents of globalization believe it allows developing countries to catch up to industrialized nations through increased manufacturing, diversification, economic expansion, and improvements in
standards of living
.
Outsourcing
by companies brings jobs and technology to developing countries, which helps them to grow their economies. Trade initiatives increase cross-border trading by removing supply-side and trade-related constraints.
Globalization has advanced
social justice
on an international scale as well, and advocates report that it has focused attention on human rights worldwide that might have otherwise been ignored on a large scale.
Cons
One clear result of globalization is that an economic downturn in one country can have a domino effect on its trade partners. For example,
the 2008 financial crisis
had a severe impact on Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain. All of these countries were members of the
European Union
, which had to bail out debt-laden nations, which were thereafter known by the acronym
PIIGS
.
5
Globalization detractors argue that it has created a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small corporate elite that can gobble up smaller competitors around the globe.
Globalization has become a polarizing issue in the U.S. with the disappearance of entire industries to new locations abroad. It's seen as a major factor in the economic squeeze on the
middle class
.
For better or worse, globalization can reduce the cultural and social aspects unique to people and geographic areas around the world and increase product homogeneity. Starbucks, Nike, and Gap dominate commercial space in many nations. The sheer size and reach of the U.S. have made the cultural exchange among nations largely a one-sided affair.
Pros
A larger market for goods and services
Cheaper consumer prices
Outsourcing can benefit domestic firms and foreign labor
Increased standard of living
Cons
Concentrates wealth in richer countries
Some poorer countries can be left behind
Labor and the physical and intellectual resources of poorer countries can be exploited
Regions and cultures lose their uniqueness and products available around the world can become homogeneous
Why Is Globalization Important?
Globalization is important as it increases the size of the global market, and allows more and different goods to be produced and sold for cheaper prices. It is also important because it is one of the most powerful forces affecting the modern world, so much so that it can be difficult to make sense of the world without understanding globalization.
For example, many of the largest and most successful corporations in the world are in effect truly multinational organizations, with offices and supply chains stretched right across the world. These companies would not be able to exist if not for the complex network of trade routes, international legal agreements, and telecommunications infrastructure that were made possible through globalization. Important political developments, such as the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China, are also directly related to globalization.
Is Globalization Good or Bad?
It depends. Proponents of globalization will point to the dramatic decline in poverty throughout the world for more than two decades after around year 2000, which many economists attribute in part to increased trade and investment between nations.
6
Similarly, they will argue that globalization has allowed products and services such as cellphones, airplanes, and information technology to be spread far more widely throughout the world.
On the other hand, critics of globalization will point to the negative impact it has had on specific nations’ industries, which might face increased competition from international firms. Globalization can also have negative environmental impacts due to economic development, industrialization, and international travel.

Definition
Equity is the remaining value of an asset or investment after considering or paying any debt owed; the term is also used to refer to capital used for funding or a brand's value.
What Is Equity?
In finance, equity refers to an ownership stake whose value is reduced by an associated debt. For homeowners,
home equity
refers to the value of a property minus the balance of any mortgages or debts.
In the stock market,
shareholders' equity
(or owners' equity for privately held companies) represents the difference between a company's assets and liabilities. If all of the company's assets were liquidated and used to pay off debts, the shareholders' equity is the amount that would be left over. In the case of an acquisition, it is the value of company sales minus any liabilities owed by the company that are not transferred with the sale.
In addition, shareholder equity can represent the book value of a company. Equity can sometimes be offered as payment-in-kind. It also represents the pro-rata ownership of a company's shares. Equity can be found on a company's balance sheet and is one of the most common pieces of data employed by analysts to assess a company's financial health.
Key Takeaways
Equity represents the value that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all its assets were liquidated and all its debts were paid off.
You can also think of equity as a degree of residual ownership in a firm or asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset.
Equity represents the shareholders' stake in the company, identified on a company's balance sheet.
The calculation of equity is a company's total assets minus its total liabilities, and it is used in several key financial ratios, such as the Return on Equity (ROE).
Home equity is the value of a homeowner's property (net of debt) and is another way the term equity is used.
Investopedia / Katie Kerpel
How Shareholder Equity Works
By comparing concrete numbers reflecting everything the company owns and owes, the ""assets-minus-liabilities"" shareholder equity equation paints a clear picture of a company's finances, easily interpreted by investors and analysts.
1
Equity is used as capital raised by a company, which is then used to purchase assets, invest in projects, and fund operations. A firm typically can raise capital by issuing debt (in the form of a loan or via bonds) or equity (by selling stock). Investors usually seek out equity investments as they provide a greater opportunity to share in the profits and growth of a firm.
Equity is important because it represents the value of an investor's stake in a company, represented by the proportion of its shares. Owning stock in a company gives shareholders the potential for capital gains and dividends. Owning equity will also give shareholders the right to vote on corporate actions and elections for the board of directors. These equity ownership benefits promote shareholders' ongoing interest in the company.

Shareholder equity can be either negative or positive. If positive, the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities. If negative, the company's liabilities exceed its assets; if prolonged, this is considered balance sheet insolvency. Typically, investors view companies with negative shareholder equity as risky or unsafe investments. Shareholder equity alone is not a definitive indicator of a company's financial health; used in conjunction with other tools and metrics, the investor can accurately analyze the health of an organization.
Formula and How to Calculate Shareholders' Equity
The following formula and calculation can be used to determine the equity of a firm, which is derived from the
accounting equation
:
Shareholders’ Equity
=
Total Assets
−
Total Liabilities
\text{Shareholders' Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}
Shareholders’ Equity
=
Total Assets
−
Total Liabilities
This information can be found on the balance sheet, where these four steps should be followed:
1
Locate the company's total assets on the balance sheet for the period.
Locate total liabilities, which should be listed separately on the balance sheet.
Subtract total liabilities from total assets to arrive at shareholder equity.
Note that total assets will equal the sum of liabilities and total equity.
Shareholder equity can also be expressed as a company's share capital and retained earnings less the value of treasury shares. This method, however, is less common. Though both methods yield the exact figure, the use of total assets and total liabilities is more illustrative of a company's financial health.
Components of Shareholder Equity
Retained earnings are part of shareholder equity and represent net income that is not paid to shareholders as dividends. Think of retained earnings as savings because it represents a cumulative total of profits that have been saved and put aside or retained for future use. Retained earnings grow larger over time as the company continues to reinvest a portion of its income.
At some point, the amount of accumulated retained earnings can exceed the amount of equity capital contributed by stockholders. Retained earnings are usually the largest component of stockholders' equity for companies that have operated for many years.
Treasury shares or stock (not to be confused with U.S. Treasury bills) represent stock that the company has bought back from existing shareholders. Companies may do a repurchase when management cannot deploy all of the available equity capital in ways that might deliver the best returns. Shares repurchased by companies become treasury shares, and the dollar value is noted in an account called treasury stock, a
contra account
to the accounts of investor capital and retained earnings. Companies can reissue treasury shares to stockholders when they need to raise money.
Many view stockholders' equity as representing a company's net assets—its net value, so to speak, would be the amount shareholders would receive if the company liquidated all of its assets and repaid all of its debts.
Example of Shareholder Equity
As part of its 2024 annual filing, Apple reported $56.95 billion in shareholder equity, down from $62.1 billion the previous year. This value was made up of common stock and additional paid-in capital. Of the 50.4 million shares authorized, the company had issued roughly 15.1 million shares.
2
Apple also has several other types of shareholder equity activity. At the end of its fiscal year 2024, Apple had an accumulated deficit of $19.2 billion. The company also reported an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $7.2 billion.
2
Shareholder Equity on AAPL 2024 Balance Sheet.
Other Forms of Equity
The concept of equity has applications beyond just evaluating companies. We can more generally think of equity as a degree of ownership in any asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset.
Below are several common variations on equity:
A stock or any other security representing an ownership interest in a company.
On a company's balance sheet, the amount of funds contributed by the owners or shareholders plus the retained earnings (or losses). One may also call this stockholders' or shareholders' equity.
The value of securities in a margin account minus what the account holder borrowed from the brokerage in margin trading.
In real estate, the difference between the property's current fair market value and the amount the owner still owes on the mortgage. It is the amount that the owner would receive after selling a property and paying any liens. Also referred to as ""real property value.""
When a business goes bankrupt and must liquidate, equity is the amount of money remaining after it has repaid its creditors. This is often called ""ownership equity,"" also known as risk
capital
or ""liable capital.""
Private Equity
When an investment is publicly traded, the market value of equity is readily available by looking at the company's share price and its market capitalization. For private entities, the market mechanism does not exist, so other valuation forms must be used to estimate value.
Private equity
generally refers to such an evaluation of companies that are not publicly traded. The accounting equation still applies, where stated equity on the balance sheet is what is left over w",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp

Value investing involves picking stocks that seem to be trading for less than their book value.
What Is Value Investing?
Value investors believe that the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that don't correspond to a company's long-term
fundamentals
. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by purchasing stocks at discounted prices.
Warren Buffett
is probably the best-known value investor today, but there are many others, including
Benjamin Graham
(Buffett's professor and mentor), David Dodd,
Charlie Munger
(Buffet's business partner), Christopher Browne (another Graham student), and billionaire
hedge-fund manager
, Seth Klarman.
Key Takeaways
Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the stock market is underestimating.
They use financial analysis, don't follow the herd, and are long-term investors in quality companies.
Value investing developed from a concept by Columbia Business School professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934.
Studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market over the long term.
Investopedia / Sydney Saporito
How Value Investing Works
The basic concept behind everyday value investing is straightforward: If you know the true value of something, you can save a lot of money when you buy it. Most folks would agree that whether you buy a new TV on sale, or at full price, you’re getting the same TV with the same screen size and picture quality.
Stock prices work in a similar manner, meaning a company’s share price can change even when the company’s valuation has remained the same. This means, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a true, or intrinsic, value of the stock of a given company. But there are relative values.
Market participants can buy or sell shares without being tethered to an objective price figure. Therefore, stocks, like TVs, go through periods of higher and lower demand leading to price fluctuations. If the company's fundamentals are the same, and its future opportunities are unchanged, then the value of the shares is largely the same even though the price differs.

Important
Value investing developed from a concept by Columbia Business School professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934 and was popularized in Graham's 1949 book, ""The Intelligent Investor
.""
Just like savvy shoppers would argue that it makes no sense to pay full price for a TV since TVs go on sale several times a year, savvy value investors believe stocks work the same way. Of course, unlike TVs, stocks won't go on sale at predictable times of the year such as
Black Friday
, and their sale prices won’t be advertised.
Value investing is the
process of doing detective work
to find these secret sales on stocks and buying them at a discount compared to how the market values them. In return for buying and holding these value stocks for the long term, investors can be rewarded handsomely.
Intrinsic Value and Value Investing
In the stock market, the equivalent of a stock being cheap or discounted is when its shares are
undervalued
. Value investors hope to profit from shares they perceive to be deeply discounted.
Investors use various metrics to attempt to find the valuation or
intrinsic value
of a stock. Intrinsic value is a combination of using financial analysis, such as studying a company's financial performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, profit, and fundamental factors. It includes the company's brand, business model, target market, and competitive advantage. Some metrics used to value a company's stock include:
Price-to-book
(P/B), which measures the value of a company's assets and compares them to the stock price. If the price is lower than the value of the assets, the stock is undervalued, assuming the company is not in financial hardship.
Price-to-earnings
(P/E), which shows the company's track record for earnings to determine if the stock price is not reflecting all of the earnings or is undervalued.
Free cash flow
, which is the cash generated from a company's revenue or operations after the costs of expenditures have been subtracted.
Free cash flow is the cash remaining after expenses have been paid, including
operating expenses
and large purchases called
capital expenditures
, which is the purchase of assets like equipment or upgrading a manufacturing plant. If a company is generating free cash flow, it'll have money left over to invest in the future of the business, pay off debt, pay
dividends
or rewards to shareholders, and issue
share buybacks
.
Of course, there are
many other metrics
used in the analysis, including analyzing debt, equity, sales, and revenue growth. After reviewing these metrics, the value investor can decide to purchase shares if the comparative value—the stock's current price vis-a-vis its company's intrinsic worth—is attractive enough.
Margin of Safety
Value investors require some room for error in their estimation of value, and they often set their own ""
margin of safety
"" based on their particular risk tolerance. The margin of safety principle, one of the keys to successful value investing, is based on the premise that buying stocks at bargain prices gives you a better chance of earning a profit later when you sell them. The margin of safety also makes you less likely to lose money if the stock doesn't perform as you had expected.
So, if you believe a stock is worth $100 and buy it for $66, you'll make a profit of $34 simply by waiting for the stock's price to rise to the $100 true value. On top of that, the company might grow and become more valuable, giving you a chance to make even more money. If the stock's price rises to $110, you'll make $44 since you bought the stock on sale. If you had purchased it at its full price of $100, you would only make a $10 profit.
Fast Fact
Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, recommended buying stocks when they were priced at two-thirds or less of their liquidation value. This was the margin of safety he felt was necessary to earn the best returns while minimizing investment downside.

Value Investors Believe the Markets Aren't Efficient
Value investors don't believe in the
efficient-market hypothesis
, which says that stock prices already take all information about a company into account, so their price always reflects their value. Instead, value investors believe that stocks may be over or underpriced for various reasons.
For example, a stock might be underpriced because the economy is performing poorly and investors are panicking and selling (as was the case during the Great Recession). Or a stock might be overpriced because investors have gotten too excited about an unproven new technology (as was the case of the dot-com bubble). Psychological biases can push a stock price up or down based on news, such as disappointing or unexpected earnings announcements, product recalls, or litigation. Stocks may also be undervalued because they trade under the radar, meaning analysts and the media inadequately cover them.
Value Investors Don't Follow the Herd
Value investors possess many characteristics of
contrarians
—they don’t follow the herd. Not only do they reject the efficient-market hypothesis, but when everyone else is buying, they’re often selling or standing back. When everyone else is selling, they’re buying or holding. Value investors don’t buy trendy stocks (because they’re typically overpriced). Instead, they invest in companies that aren’t household names if the financials check out. They also take a second look at stocks that are household names when those stocks’ prices have plummeted, believing such companies can recover from setbacks if their fundamentals remain strong and their products and services still have quality.
Value investors only care about a stock’s intrinsic value. They think about buying a stock for what it actually is: a percentage of ownership in a company. They want to own companies that they know have sound principles and sound financials, regardless of what everyone else is saying or doing.
Value Investing Requires Diligence and Patience
Estimating the true intrinsic value of a stock involves some financial analysis but also involves a fair amount of subjectivity—meaning at times",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp

The law of demand states that as the price of a good rises, consumers will demand correspondingly lower quantities of that good.
What Is the Law of Demand?
The law of demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics. Alongside the
law of supply
, it explains how market economies allocate resources and determine the prices of goods and services.
The law of demand states that the quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. This occurs because of
diminishing marginal utility
.
1
That is, consumers use the first units of an economic good they purchase to serve their most urgent needs first, then they use each additional unit of the good to serve successively lower-valued ends.
2
Key Takeaways
Demand is derived from the law of diminishing marginal utility, the fact that consumers use economic goods to satisfy their most urgent needs first.
A market demand curve expresses the sum of quantity demanded at each price across all consumers in the market.
Changes in price can be reflected in movement along a demand curve, but by themselves, they don't increase or decrease demand.
The shape and magnitude of demand shifts in response to changes in consumer preferences, incomes, or related economic goods, not usually to changes in price.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
Understanding the Law of Demand
Economics
involves the study of how people use limited means to satisfy unlimited wants. The law of demand focuses on those unlimited wants. Naturally, people prioritize more urgent wants and needs over less urgent ones in their economic behavior, and this carries over into how people choose among the limited means available to them.
For any economic good, the first unit of that good that a consumer gets their hands on will tend to be used to satisfy the most urgent need the consumer has that that good can satisfy.
For example, consider a castaway on a desert island who obtains a six-pack of bottled fresh water that washes up onshore. The first bottle will be used to satisfy the castaway’s most urgently felt need, which is most likely drinking water to avoid dying of thirst.

The second bottle might be used for bathing to stave off disease, an urgent but less immediate need. The third bottle could be used for a less urgent need, such as boiling some fish to have a hot meal, and on down to the last bottle, which the castaway uses for a relatively low priority, such as watering a small potted plant to feel less alone on the island.
Because each additional bottle of water is used for a successively less highly valued want or need by our castaway, we can say that the castaway values each additional bottle less than the one before.
Fast Fact
The more units of a good that consumers buy, the less they are willing to pay in terms of price.
Similarly, when consumers purchase goods on the market, each additional unit of any given good or service that they buy will be put to a less valued use than the one before, so we can say that they value each additional unit less and less. Because they
value each additional unit of the good less
, they aren't willing to pay as much for it.
By adding up all the units of a good that consumers are willing to buy at any given price, we can describe a market
demand curve
, which is always sloping downward, like the one shown in the chart below. Each point on the curve (A, B, C) reflects the quantity demanded (Q) at a given price (P). At point A, for example, the quantity demanded is low (Q1) and the price is high (P1). At higher prices, consumers demand less of the good, and at lower prices, they demand more.

Demand vs. Quantity Demanded
In economic thinking, it is important to understand the difference between the phenomenon of demand and the quantity demanded. In the chart above, the term “demand” refers to the light blue line plotted through A, B, and C.
It expresses the relationship between the urgency of
consumer wants
and the number of units of the economic good at hand. A change in demand means a shift of the position or shape of this curve; it reflects a change in the underlying pattern of consumer wants and needs vis-à-vis the means available to satisfy them.
On the other hand, the term “quantity demanded” refers to a point along the horizontal axis. Changes in the quantity demanded strictly reflect changes in the price, without implying any change in the pattern of consumer preferences.
3
Changes in quantity demanded just mean movement along the demand curve itself because of a change in price. These two ideas are often conflated, but this is a common error—rising (or falling) prices don't decrease (or increase) demand;
they change the quantity demanded
.
Factors Affecting Demand
So what does change demand? The shape and position of the demand curve can be affected by several factors. Rising incomes tend to increase demand for normal economic goods, as people are willing to spend more. The availability of close substitute products that compete with a given economic good will tend to reduce demand for that good because they can satisfy the same kinds of consumer wants and needs.
Conversely, the availability of closely complementary goods will tend to increase demand for an economic good because the use of two goods together can be even more valuable to consumers than using them separately, like peanut butter and jelly.
Important
Other factors such as future expectations, changes in background environmental conditions, or changes in the actual or perceived quality of a good can change the demand curve because they alter the pattern of consumer preferences for how the good can be used and how urgently it is needed.
3
Law of Supply
Supply
is the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to consumers at a certain price point. As the supply of a product fluctuates, so does the demand, which directly affects the price of the product.
The law of supply, then, is a
microeconomic
law stating that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service rises, the quantity that suppliers offer will rise in turn (and vice versa). When demand exceeds the available supply, the price of a product typically will rise. Conversely, should the supply of an item increase while the demand remains the same, the price will go down.
4
How Will I Use This in Real Life?
The law of demand is relevant to anyone who participates in the market as a buyer. It explains how people change their consumption habits in response to changing prices.
If you own a car, you have probably experienced the law of demand with respect to gas prices. When gas is cheap, people drive more often and take longer trips. When the price of gas rises, people limit their driving to essential travel to reduce their gas consumption.
Explain Like I'm Five
The law of demand states that when the price of a good rises, consumers will purchase less of that good. Likewise, when the price falls, consumers buy more of that good. The law of demand is usually paired with the law of supply, which states that suppliers will produce more of a good when prices rise.
What Is a Simple Explanation of the Law of Demand?
The law of demand tells us that if more people want to buy something, given a limited supply, the price of that thing will be bid higher. Likewise, the higher the price of a good, the lower the quantity that will be purchased by consumers.
Why Is the Law of Demand Important?
Together with the law of supply, the law of demand helps us understand why things are priced at the level that they are, and to identify opportunities to buy what are perceived to be underpriced (or sell overpriced) products, assets, or
securities
. For instance, a firm may boost production in response to rising prices that have been spurred by a surge in demand.
Can the Law of Demand Be Broken?
Yes. In certain cases, an increase in demand doesn't affect prices in ways predicted by the law of demand. For instance, so-called
Veblen goods
are things for which demand increases as their price rises, as they are perceived as status symbols. Similarly, demand for
Giffen goods
(which, in contrast to Veblen goods, aren't luxury items) rises when the price go",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp

The Sharpe ratio shows whether a portfolio's excess returns are attributable to smart investment decisions or luck and risk.
What Is the Sharpe Ratio?
The Sharpe ratio was developed by economist
William F. Sharpe
in 1966. It compares the return of an investment with its risk.
The ratio's numerator is the difference between realized, or expected, returns and a benchmark such as the
risk-free rate of return
or the performance of a particular investment category over time. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period, a measure of volatility and risk.
Key Takeaways
Economist William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 after his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM),
The Sharpe ratio compares a fund's historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expected variability of such returns.
Excess returns are those above an industry benchmark or the risk-free rate of return.
William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966.
Michela Buttignol
Formula and Calculation of the Sharpe Ratio
Economist William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 as an outgrowth of his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), calling it the reward-to-variability ratio. Sharpe won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on CAPM in 1990.

Standard deviation
is derived from the variability of returns for a series of time intervals, adding up to the total performance sample under consideration.
The numerator's total return differential versus a benchmark (
Rp
-
Rf)
is calculated as the average of the return differentials in each of the incremental periods making up the total. For example, the numerator of a 10-year Sharpe ratio might be the average of 120 monthly return differentials for a fund versus an industry benchmark.
The Sharpe ratio's denominator in that example will be those monthly returns standard deviation, calculated as follows:
Take the return
variance
from the average return in each of the incremental periods, square it, and sum the squares from all of the incremental periods.
Divide the sum by the number of incremental periods.
Take the square root of the quotient.
What the Sharpe Ratio Can Tell You
The Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used methods for measuring risk-adjusted relative returns. It compares a fund's historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expected
variability
of such returns.

The risk-free rate was initially used in the formula to denote an investor's hypothetical minimal borrowing costs. More generally, it represents the
risk premium
of an investment versus a safe asset such as a Treasury bill or bond.
1
When benchmarked against the returns of an industry sector or investing strategy, the Sharpe ratio provides a measure of risk-adjusted performance not attributable to such affiliations.
The ratio is useful in determining to what degree excess historical returns were accompanied by excess volatility. While excess returns are measured in comparison with an investing benchmark, the standard deviation formula gauges volatility based on the variance of returns from their mean.
The ratio's utility relies on the assumption that the historical record of relative risk-adjusted returns has at least some predictive value.
1
Important
Generally, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.
The Sharpe ratio can be used to evaluate a portfolio’s risk-adjusted performance. Alternatively, an investor could use a fund's return objective to estimate its projected Sharpe ratio
ex-ante
.
The Sharpe ratio can help explain whether a portfolio's excess returns are attributable to smart investment decisions or simply luck and risk.
For example, low-quality, highly speculative stocks can outperform blue chip shares for considerable periods, as during the
Dot-Com Bubble
or, more recently, the
meme stocks
frenzy. If a YouTuber happens to beat Warren Buffett in the market for a while as a result, the Sharpe ratio will provide a quick reality check by adjusting each manager's performance for their portfolio's volatility.
The greater a portfolio's Sharpe ratio, the better its risk-adjusted performance. A negative Sharpe ratio means the risk-free or benchmark rate is greater than the portfolio’s historical or projected return, or else the portfolio's return is expected to be negative.
Sharpe Ratio Pitfalls
The Sharpe ratio can be manipulated by portfolio managers seeking to boost their
apparent risk-adjusted returns
history. This can be done by lengthening the return measurement intervals, which results in a lower estimate of volatility.
For example, the standard deviation (volatility) of annual returns is generally lower than that of monthly returns, which are in turn less volatile than daily returns. Financial analysts typically consider the volatility of monthly returns when using the Sharpe ratio.
Calculating the Sharpe ratio for the most favorable stretch of performance rather than an objectively chosen look-back period is another way to cherry-pick the data that will distort the risk-adjusted returns.
The Sharpe ratio also has some inherent limitations. The standard deviation calculation in the ratio's denominator, which serves as its proxy for portfolio risk, calculates volatility based on a
normal distribution
and is most useful in evaluating symmetrical
probability distribution
curves.
Alison Czinkota / Investopedia
In contrast, financial markets subject to
herding behavior
can go to extremes much more often than a normal distribution would suggest is possible. As a result, the standard deviation used to calculate the Sharpe ratio may understate
tail risk
.
Market returns are also subject to
serial correlation
. The simplest example is that returns in adjacent time intervals may be correlated because they were influenced by the same market trend. But
mean reversion
also depends on serial correlation, just like
market momentum
.
The upshot is that serial correlation tends to lower volatility, and as a result, investment strategies dependent on serial correlation factors may exhibit misleadingly high Sharpe ratios.
One way to visualize these criticisms is to consider the investment strategy of picking up nickels in front of a steamroller that moves slowly and predictably nearly all the time, except for the few rare occasions when it suddenly and fatally accelerates.
Because such unfortunate events are extremely uncommon, those picking up nickels would, most of the time, deliver positive returns with minimal volatility, earning high Sharpe ratios as a result.
And if a fund picking up the proverbial nickels in front of a steamroller got flattened on one of those extremely rare and unfortunate occasions, its long-term Sharpe might still look good: just one bad month, after all. Unfortunately, that would bring little comfort to the fund's investors.
Sharpe Alternatives: The Sortino and the Treynor
The standard deviation in the Sharpe ratio's formula assumes that price movements in either direction are equally risky. The risk of an abnormally low return is very different from the possibility of an abnormally high one for most investors and analysts.
A variation of the Sharpe called the
Sortino ratio
ignores the above-average returns to focus solely on
downside deviation
as a better proxy for the risk of a fund or portfolio.
The standard deviation in the denominator of a Sortino ratio measures the variance of negative returns or those below a chosen benchmark relative to the average of such returns.
Another variation of the Sharpe is the
Treynor ratio
, which divides excess return over a risk-free rate or benchmark by the beta of a security,",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp

The Fed uses open market operations to keep the federal funds rate at its established target.
What Are Open Market Operations (OMOs)?
Open market operation (OMO) is a term that refers to the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by the
Federal Reserve
(Fed). The Fed conducts open market operations to regulate the supply of money that is on reserve in U.S. banks. The Fed purchases Treasury securities to increase the money supply and sells them to reduce it.
By using OMOs, the Fed can adjust the federal funds rate, which in turn influences other short-term rates, long-term rates, and foreign exchange rates. This can change the amount of money and credit available in the economy and affect certain economic factors, such as unemployment, output, and the costs of goods and services.
Key Takeaways
Open market operations are one of three tools used by the Fed to affect the availability of money and credit.
The term refers to a central bank buying or selling securities in the open market to influence the money supply.
Buying securities adds money to the system, lowers rates, makes loans easier to obtain, and increases economic activity.
Selling securities removes money from the system, raises rates, makes loans more expensive, and decreases economic activity.
Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu
Understanding Open Market Operations (OMOs)
To understand open market operations, you first have to understand how the Fed, the
central bank
of the U.S., implements the nation's
monetary policy
.
To keep the U.S. economy on an even keel and to forestall the ill effects of uncontrolled price inflation or deflation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets what's called a target
federal funds rate
.
1
The federal funds rate is the interest rate that
depository
institutions charge each other for overnight loans. This constant flow of money allows banks to earn a return on excess cash in their Fed balances while maintaining the reserves required to meet the demands of customers.

As a benchmark, the federal funds rate influences a variety of other rates, from savings deposit rates to
home mortgage rates
and credit card interest rates.

Open market operations is one of the tools that the Fed uses to keep the federal funds rate at its established target.
The U.S. central bank can lower the interest rate by purchasing securities (and injecting money into the money supply). Similarly, it can sell securities from its balance sheet, take money out of circulation, and put upward pressure on interest rates.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets a target federal funds rate and then the
Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) implements the open market operations to achieve that rate.
3
Types of Open Market Operations
There are two types of OMOs: permanent open market operations and temporary open market operations.
Permanent open market operations
Permanent open market operations
refer to the Fed's outright purchase or sale of securities for or from its portfolio. Permanent OMOs are used to achieve traditional goals. For example, the Fed will adjust its holdings to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates
and to improve financial conditions for consumers and businesses. Permanent OMOs are also used to reinvest principal received on currently held securities.
4
Temporary open market operations
Temporary open market operations are used to add or drain reserves available to the banking system on a short-term basis. They address reserve needs that are deemed to be transitory. Unlike Permanent OMOs, which involve outright purchases or sales, Temporary OMOs are temporary transactions. They're either
repurchase agreements
(repos) or
reverse repurchase agreements
(reverse repos).

A repo is a transaction where the Fed's trading desk buys securities and agrees to sell them back at a future date. A reverse repo involves the Fed selling securities with the agreement that it will buy them back in the future. Overnight reverse repos are currently used by the Fed to maintain the federal funds rate in its FOMC-established target range.

Fast Fact
U.S. Treasury securities, or Treasuries, are government bills, notes, and bonds that are purchased by many individual consumers. They're also purchased and held in large quantities by various types of financial institutions. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the government and are considered a safe investment. Treasuries are first issued by the government and then traded in the
secondary market
.
Expansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy
The Fed's monetary policy can be expansionary or contractionary.
5
If the Fed's goal is to expand the money supply and boost demand, the policy is
expansionary
. The Fed will buy Treasuries to pour cash into the banks. That encourages banks to lend the excess money that it doesn't have to keep in reserve out to consumers and businesses.
As the banks compete for customers, interest rates drift downwards. Consumers can borrow more to buy more. Businesses are eager to borrow more to expand.
5
If the Fed's goal is to contract the money supply and decrease demand, the policy is
contractionary
. The Fed will sell Treasuries to pull money out of the system. Less money in the economy means interest rates drift upwards and borrowing decreases. Consumers pull back on their spending. Businesses trim their plans for growth. Economic activity slows down.
5
Benefits of Open Market Operations
Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve (or the central banks in other countries) to prevent price inflation or deflation without directly interfering in the market economy. Instead of using regulations to control lending, the Fed can simply raise or lower the cost of borrowing money.
This allows the Federal Reserve to moderate the business cycle and reduce economic shocks. During recessions, the central bank lowers the cost of borrowing money, encouraging business activity and growth. In times of
froth
, the Fed increases the cost of borrowing money to rein in speculation and deflate potential bubbles.
Open market operations can also be used to affect job growth. By lowering interest rates, the Fed can make it easier to start businesses and hire workers, resulting in increased employment.
Example of Open Market Operations
In 2019, the Federal Reserve used Temporary OMOs (term and overnight repos) to support a healthy supply of bank reserves during what it referred to as ""periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities,"" and to ""mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.""
6
It also used repos to counteract the stress caused by COVID-19 in 2020 and to ensure that banks could maintain plentiful amounts of reserves. Repos also helped accommodate the ""smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.""
6
Open Market Operations vs. Quantitative Easing
As discussed above, open market operations is one of the Fed's policy tools frequently used to expand the money supply and support economic activity or contact the money supply and slow that activity.
Quantitative easing (QE) is an alternate, non-traditional tool that the Fed also uses for monetary policy purposes. Essentially, it involves the buying of securities on a very large scale to spur or steady the economy.
The Fed normally employs quantitative easing after other monetary policy tools have been used but something more is needed to boost slow lending and economic activity. For instance, QE may be used when interest rates are already low but economic output is still less than what the Fed believes is healthy.
Why Does the Federal Reserve Conduct Open Market Operations?
Open market operations are used by the Federal Reserve to move the federal funds rate and influence other interest rates. It does this to stimulate or slow down the economy. The Fed can increase the money supply and lower the fed funds rate by purchasing, usually, Treasury securities. Similarly, it can raise the fed funds rate by selling securities from its balance sheet. This takes money out of circulation and pressures interest rates to rise.

Financial statements are formal records that summarize a company's financial performance and position, providing a clear picture of its financial health.
What Are Financial Statements?
Financial statements are reports businesses compile to record financial performance and health. They offer a clear, standardized picture to parties such as investors, creditors, and management, allowing them to assess operations and whether the business is headed in the right direction.
Key Takeaways
Financial statements provide an overview of a company's financial health to stakeholders.
The four primary types of financial statements are: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of shareholders' equity.
Understanding how to read financial statements allows you to make informed investment decisions about a company's performance, stability, and future potential.
Financial statements must present complex data in a clear and accessible way for everyone, from CEOs to average consumers.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
How Financial Statements Work
Financial statements organize important financial data so stakeholders, including board members, investors, shareholders, creditors, employees, customers, and analysts, can analyze the health of a company's finances. These statements must present complex data in a clear and accessible way for everyone, from CEOs to average consumers.
Accountants prepare financial statements following specific accounting rules, like the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
for U.S. companies or the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
for many international companies. These accounting standards ensure that financial statements are clear, consistent, and comparable, so financial data presentation is as similar as possible.
There are four primary types of financial statements that provide valuable insights into a company's financial position and performance.
Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)
A company's balance sheet provides stakeholders with a snapshot of its assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity at a specific point in time—typically the last day of the reporting period. Rather than predicting future success or trends, the balance sheet reflects the company's current financial position.

The balance sheets follow the standard equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
You must understand a few basic financial terms to read a balance sheet effectively.
Assets
Assets represent what a company owns and are categorized as either
current or non-current assets
.
Current Assets
Current assets, often considered short-term assets, can be converted into cash within the firm's fiscal year.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
:
Any highly liquid asset, like cash, checking accounts, or money market funds.
Accounts Receivable
: Money owed by customers.
Inventory
: Products or raw materials used for products.
Prepaid Expenses
: Payments made in advance for expenses like rent or insurance.
Non-Current Assets
These assets, also called long-term assets, are critical for a company's success but cannot be converted into cash within the firm's fiscal year.
Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)
:
Buildings, machinery, vehicles, or other equipment.
Intangible Assets
: Non-physical assets like patents and trademarks.
Long-term Investments
:
Stocks, bonds, or notes held more than one year.
Deferred Tax Assets
:
Taxes due back for overpayment or advance payment.
Liabilities
Current Liabilities
The
liabilities
due within a year.
Accounts Payable
: Money owed to suppliers and vendors.
Short-term Debt
: Loans or credit lines due within the year.
Accrued Expenses
: Incurred, but unpaid costs like wages or taxes.
Unearned Revenue
:
Money received for goods or services not yet delivered.
Non-Current Liabilities
Often called
long-term liabilities
, these are the company's financial obligations not due within a year.
Long-term Debt
:
Debt payable in more than one year, such as bonds or long-term loans.
Deferred Tax Liabilities
: Future tax payments.
Pension Liabilities
:
Employee retirement benefits obligations.
Lease Liabilities
: Long-term lease commitments for buildings or equipment.
Equity
Equity
, also called net assets, represents the company's assets minus its liabilities. Net assets are payable to shareholders.
Common Stock/Preferred Stock
: Value of issued shares.
Retained Earnings
: Profits not distributed as dividends.
Treasury Stock
:
The company's repurchased stock.
Income Statement (Profit & Loss Statement)
An income statement overviews a company’s revenues, expenses, net income, and earnings per share over a specified period, such as a quarter or a year. It answers the question: Did the company make money?
Income statements
help stakeholders assess financial health and management success by comparing income statements across multiple periods.
Key Components of Income Statements:
Revenue
: Total income from sales or services rendered.
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
: Cost of producing goods.
Gross Profit
:
All revenue minus the cost of goods sold.
Operating Expenses
:
Costs to run the company, such as rent, salaries, and utilities.
Net Income
:
The final profit after paying all expenses and taxes.
Important
This statement has a few key components, but the formula for calculating shareholder equity varies from company to company.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income
expands equity exploration by including items not typically seen on a traditional income statement. It accounts for adjustments in securities held for sale by the firm, unrealized gains or losses on investments, hedging activities, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and adjustments to future pensions.
Some companies produce a separate statement for comprehensive income, while others include it as a footnote on the income statement. While it is easy to overlook, comprehensive income gives a much fuller picture of the company's financial position.
Cash Flow Statement
A company's
cash flow statement (CFS)
tracks the movement of cash into and out of the business over time. The primary purpose of the CFS is to show stakeholders where a company's money is coming from and how management is spending it. Cash flow statements are divided into three categories:
Operating activities
: Cash from day-to-day business operations
Investing activities:
Cash spent on or earned from investments
Financing activities:
Cash made from borrowing, debt repayment, or issuing stock
The cash flow statement shows where money went and if there is enough left or incoming to sustain future operations.
Statement of Shareholders’ Equity
The Statement of Shareholders' Equity shows how a company's equity changes over a reporting period. It complements the balance sheet and helps assess whether the company's stock is profitable.
Another way to use the Statement of Shareholders' Equity is to assess how much money is left for shareholders after the company pays all liabilities and accounts for all assets. The leftover equity should accurately reflect the cost per share. A positive number signals stability, while a negative result may indicate looming financial trouble, possibly even bankruptcy.
History of Financial Statements
Until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), through the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, mandated that public companies have audits, financial statements were merely something some companies used to attract investors.
1
However, after the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression, mistrust grew due to manipulated financial data.
As the stock market and regulations evolved, independent auditors established standard reporting procedures to keep financial statements transparent and uniform. Today, several international and national standards boards regulate reporting structures to ensure that companies report accurate and transparent information.
Limitations of Financial Statements
While financial statements are informative, they have limitations:
Historical Data
: Financial statements report past performance and rely on interpretation to predict future success.

Social media is a form of digital communication that allows users to form online networks and communities for socializing, sharing information, and posting user-created content.
What Is Social Media?
Social media refers to online platforms where users can share information and connect with virtual communities through text, video, photos, and other content. As of 2024, social media had more than five billion global users, which is equal to more than 62% of the world population.
1
This includes apps or websites designed for messaging and chat, social platforms (like
Facebook
, Instagram, and TikTok), and community forums, such as Reddit and Discord.
Key Takeaways
Social media is made up of websites, apps, and other platforms that allow users to share information and ideas with virtual communities through text, photos, videos, and more.
It is used by more than 5 billion people globally for personal and professional reasons.
1
Social media has been credited with connecting users, allowing for community building and sharing important information.
Critics say social media damages adolescents' mental health, facilitates misinformation, and increases opportunities for child sexual abuse.
The largest social media platforms are Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and TikTok.
Origins and Evolution of Social Media
Early social media platforms, such as MySpace and LiveJournal, were designed for people to connect with friends and family. MySpace, which allowed users to create personal profile pages and share information about themselves, became the first network to reach one million
active monthly users
in 2004.
2
LiveJournal, a platform where users could share journal-like entries with either public or private networks, reached over 2.5 million active accounts in 2005.
3
Social media use grew rapidly in the 2000s and early 2010s as Facebook and
X (formerly Twitter)
became popular. Like MySpace, Facebook users create profiles to share information about themselves, while other users leave comments. Initially used for socializing among college-age users, social media became popular with younger and older users.
In 2006, X's launch included its feed feature, where posts from accounts that a user followed were aggregated onto a single page.
4
Facebook launched its own News Feed feature.
5
The news feed became a standard feature for many social media platforms. More users began posting links to external sites, where news stories, current events, and product pages could be shared with personal updates. Users could interact with each other's content, including liking, sharing, and commenting on posts.
During this time, social media platforms began adding business-specific profile pages and the ability to purchase targeted ads that other users would see, making them more business-friendly and increasing revenue for the platforms.

Social media users began spending more time scrolling through feeds and consuming daily news and commentary on current events. By 2024, just over half (54%) of adults in the U.S. said they get their news from social media ""sometimes"" or ""often."" Only 28% of U.S. adults say they ""never"" get the news from social media.
7
Globally, only 22% of consumers get their news directly from news websites or apps, with younger news consumers the least likely to do so.
8
Fast Fact
Many
social media companies
own multiple platforms to target different users. For example, Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp.
9
How Social Media Is Used Today
As users continued to spend more time on social media sites, different types of social media platforms evolved. They can be broadly categorized as:
Social networks
: Facebook, NextDoor
Microblogging
: X, BlueSky, Mastodon, Threads
Long-form blogging
: Substack, Ghost
Professional networking
: LinkedIn, Behance, ResearchGate
Video and photo sharing
: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat
Visual curation and search
: Pinterest, Houzz, DeviantArt
Messaging
: WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat, Marco Polo
Community forums
: Reddit, Discord, Clubhouse
Platforms are oriented toward different uses and users. Some may be used purely for socializing, while others are oriented toward professional network building or job-hunting. Some platforms allow users to connect with others who share their political views or leisure hobbies.
Many social media users are acting in a professional capacity. For instance:
Actors and writers can use social media to connect with fans of their work
Politicians use them to communicate with constituents and voters
Nonprofit organizations may use them to promote charitable causes or collect donations
Government agencies can use social media to communicate with the public during emergencies.
Posting content on social media, either sponsored by a business or funded through follower support, can also be a job in itself, separate from any outside work that the social media posts are promoting. These types of social media users are generally referred to as
influencers
or content creators. One in five social media users consider themselves professional content creators.
10
Social media is also an important form of marketing for many companies. Businesses use social media to identify and capitalize on consumer
trends
, engage with customers, collect consumer data, and pay for targeted advertising. Many also work with influencers, paying content creators to promote their products or services directly to the influencers' audience or followers.

: Social media platforms allow people to access global information and connect with friends and family at a distance. It can allow users to find niche communities around their interests or current needs, such as neighborhood forums or job searching.
Build community
: Using social media is correlated to having more friends and a personal network with greater diversity, especially in emerging economies. Social media users are more likely to interact with those who are different from them across categories of income, political party, religion, or ethnicity.
11
Affordable advertising
: Small businesses and creators can reach potential customers at low price points through targeted ads and influencer marketing. More than 200 million small businesses use Facebook.
12
In 2024, online advertising, including social media and search advertising, accounted for 59% of global ad spending; that number is projected to grow to 61% in 2026.
13
80%
Percentage of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 who said that social media helped them feel more connected to friends in 2022. Nearly one in three teens said social media had a mostly positive impact on their lives, while fewer than one in ten said its impact was mostly negative.
14
Disadvantages Explained
Disinformation/misinformation
: The ease of sharing links and posts on social media can facilitate the spread of disinformation or
misinformation
. For instance, misinformation about Hurricane Helene hampered recovery efforts in the southern U.S. and harmed local communities impacted by the disaster in 2024.
15
Sleep disruption
: Social media use is correlated with less and poor quality sleep, especially among teens and young adults.
16
17
Poor sleep is associated with a variety of health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and depression.
Mental health impact
: Research has also found a direct correlation between more
social media use and higher rates of depression among teens
.
17
Other mental health concerns related to social media use include bullying, peer pressure, spreading rumors about peers and friends, and the creation of unrealistic expectations based on exposure to other people's lives.
18
Child sexual abuse
: In 2022, research found that more than one in six U.S. children experience sexual abuse online. Studies in other countries have found even higher rates. Social media can provide a platform for child sexual abuse and exploitation including grooming, stalking, sharing of explicit materials, revenge pornography, and nonconsensual sexting.

Definition
Opportunity cost is any gain you pass up by deciding on one use of your resources over others.
What Is Opportunity Cost?
Opportunity cost represents the desirable benefits someone foregoes by choosing one alternative instead of another.
While opportunity costs can't be predicted with total certainty, taking them into consideration can lead to better decision making.
Key Takeaways
Opportunity cost is the forgone benefit from an option that you failed to choose.
To properly evaluate opportunity cost, the costs and benefits of every option available must be considered and weighed against the others.
Considering potential opportunity costs can guide individuals and organizations to more profitable decision making.
This cost of a lost benefit is a strictly internal measure used for strategic planning; it is not included in accounting profit or reflected in external financial reporting.
Examples of opportunity cost considerations include investing in a new manufacturing plant in Los Angeles as opposed to Mexico City, deciding to upgrade company equipment rather than hire additional workers, or buying stock A and not stock B.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
Formula for Calculating Opportunity Cost
We can express the opportunity cost related to investing by calculating the difference between the expected returns of two investment options.
Opportunity Cost
=
RMPIC
−
RICP
where:
RMPIC
=
Return on most profitable investment choice
RICP
=
Return on investment chosen to pursue
\begin{aligned}&\text{Opportunity Cost} = \text{RMPIC}-\text{RICP}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{RMPIC}=\text{Return on most profitable investment choice}\\&\text{RICP}=\text{Return on investment chosen to pursue}\end{aligned}
​
Opportunity Cost
=
RMPIC
−
RICP
where:
RMPIC
=
Return on most profitable investment choice
RICP
=
Return on investment chosen to pursue
​
Consider a company that is faced with the following two mutually exclusive options:
Option A: Invest excess capital in the stock market
Option B: Invest excess capital back into the business for new equipment to increase production
Assume the expected
return on investment (ROI)
in the stock market is 10% over the next year, while the company estimates that the equipment update would generate an 8% return over the same time period.
The opportunity cost of choosing the equipment over the stock market is 2% (10% - 8%). In other words, by investing in the business, the company would forgo the opportunity to earn a higher return—at least for that first year.
Important
When considering two different securities, it is important to take risk into account. For example, comparing a
Treasury bill
to a highly
volatile
stock can be misleading, even if both have the same expected return (an opportunity cost of 0%). That's because the U.S. government backs the return on the T-bill, making it virtually risk-free, and there is no such guarantee in the stock market.
Opportunity Cost and Capital Structure
Opportunity cost analysis can play a crucial role in determining a company's
capital structure
.
A business incurs an explicit cost in taking on
debt
or issuing
equity
because it must compensate its lenders or shareholders. And each option also carries an opportunity cost.
Money that a company uses to make payments on its bonds or other debt, for example, cannot be invested for other purposes.
So the company must decide if financing an expansion or other growth opportunity with debt would be better than financing it with equity.
Companies try to weigh the costs and benefits of borrowing money vs. issuing stock, including both monetary and non-monetary considerations, to arrive at an optimal balance that minimizes opportunity costs.
Because opportunity cost is a forward-looking consideration, the actual
rate of return (RoR)
for both options is unknown at that point, making this evaluation tricky in practice.
Examples of Opportunity Costs
For a Business
Assume that a business has $20,000 in available funds and must choose between investing the money in
securities
, which it expects to return 10% a year, or using it to purchase new machinery.
No matter which option the business chooses, the potential profit that it gives up by not investing in the other option is the opportunity cost.
If the business decides to go with the securities option, its investment would theoretically gain $2,000 in the first year, $2,200 in the second, and $2,420 in the third.
Alternatively, if the business purchases a new machine, it will be able to increase its production. But the machine setup and employee training will be intensive, and the new machine will not be up to maximum efficiency for the first couple of years.
So the company estimates that it would net an additional $500 in profit in the first year, then $2,000 in year two, and $5,000 in all future years.
By these calculations, choosing the securities makes sense in the first and second years. However, by the third year, an analysis of the opportunity cost indicates that the new machine is the better option ($500 + $2,000 + $5,000) - ($2,000 - $2,200 - $2,420) = $880.
Most Expensive Pizza Ever?
One of the most dramatic examples of opportunity cost is a 2010 exchange of 10,000 bitcoins for two large pizzas—at the time worth about $41.
1
As of August 2024, those 10,000 bitcoins were worth over $690 million.
2
For an Individual
Individuals also
face decisions involving
such missed opportunities, even if the stakes are often smaller.
Suppose, for example, that you've just received an unexpected $1,000 bonus at work. You could simply spend it now, such as on a spur-of-the-moment vacation. Or you could invest it for a future trip.
For example, if you were to invest the entire amount in a safe,
one-year certificate of deposit
that paid 5%, you'd have $1,050 to play with next year at this time.
You'd also face an opportunity cost with your vacation days at work. If you use some of them now with your spare $1,000 you won't have them next year (assuming your employer lets you roll them over from year to year).
As with many similar decisions, there is no right or wrong answer here, but it can be helpful to think it through and decide what you want more.
Explicit vs. Implicit Costs
Company expenses are broadly divided into two categories—explicit costs and implicit costs. The former are expenses like rents, salaries, and other operating expenses that are paid with a company's tangible assets and recorded on a company' financial statements.
By contrast, implicit costs are technically not incurred and cannot be measured accurately for accounting purposes. There are no cash exchanges in the realization of implicit costs.
Instead, they are opportunity costs, making them synonymous with imputed costs, while explicit costs are considered out-of-pocket expenses.
Opportunity Cost vs. Sunk Cost
A
sunk cost
is money already spent at some point in the past, while opportunity cost is the potential return not earned in the future on an investment because the money was invested elsewhere. When considering the latter, any sunk costs previously incurred are typically ignored.
3
Buying 1,000 shares of company A at $10 a share, for instance, represents a sunk cost of $10,000. This is the amount of money paid out to invest, and it can't be recouped without selling the stock (and you might not make the full $10,000 back).
From an accounting perspective, a sunk cost also could refer to the initial outlay to purchase an expensive piece of heavy equipment, which might be
amortized
over time, but which is sunk in the sense that the company won't be getting the money back.
Opportunity Cost vs. Risk
In economics,
risk
describes the possibility that an investment's actual and projected returns will be different and that the investor may lose some or all of their capital.
Opportunity cost reflects the possibility that the returns of a chosen investment will be lower than the returns of a forgone investment.
The key difference is that risk compares the actual performance of an investment against the projected performance of the same investment, while opportunity cost compares the projected performance of an investment against the projected performance of another investment.
Accounting Profit vs. Economic Profit
Accounting profit
is the net income calculation often stipulated by the
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
used by most companies in the U.S. Under those rules, only explicit, real costs are subtracted from total revenue.
Economic profit
, however, includes opportunity cost as an expense. This theoretical calculation can be used to compare the actual",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp

Definition
An asset can be anything that has a monetary value that produces income for its owner or that could produce income if used or sold.
What Is an Asset?
An asset is a resource, tangible or intangible, that holds some monetary value that can be exploited by its owner. The asset may produce income, such as rental fees, or may produce a profit if sold, such as stocks or jewelry.
For an individual or a family, assets may include a home, savings, investments, and personal possessions that have intrinsic value.
A company categorizes its assets as current assets, like inventory, which is intended for immediate use; fixed assets, like a factory and its equipment; financial assets, such as stock investments, and intangible assets, like goodwill.
Key Takeaways
Assets are things that have value.
An asset may produce income, now or in the future.
An asset may appreciate in value over time.
In business, an asset may generate cash flow, reduce expenses, or improve sales.
Investopedia / Nez Riaz
How Assets Work
Individuals usually think of assets as items of value that can be converted into cash at some future point and that might also be income-producing or appreciating in value until that time. They can be financial assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds or physical assets like a home or an art collection.
An asset may be something that has the potential to generate cash flow in the case of businesses. It might reduce expenses or improve sales regardless of whether it's a
tangible asset
like manufacturing equipment or a fleet of trucks or an
intangible asset
like a patent or a trademark.

A company must possess a right to the asset as of the date of its financial statements for it to be counted as one of its assets.
Types of Assets
Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet and can be broadly categorized into current or short-term assets,
fixed assets
, financial assets, or intangible assets.
Current Assets
Current assets
are short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash or consumed within one year. Current assets can include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable
, physical inventory, and various prepaid expenses.
1
Cash is easy to value but accountants must periodically reassess the recoverability of inventory and accounts receivable. A receivable will be classified as
impaired
if there's evidence that it might be uncollectible. Companies might have to
write off
those assets if inventory becomes obsolete.
Important
Some assets are recorded on companies' balance sheets using the concept of
historical cost
. It represents the original cost of the asset when it was purchased by the company and it can also include expenses such as delivery and setup incurred to incorporate an asset into the company's operations.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are resources with an expected life of more than a year, such as plants, equipment, and buildings. An accounting adjustment known as
depreciation
is made for fixed assets as they age. It allocates the cost of the asset over time. Depreciation may or may not reflect the fixed asset's loss of earning power.
2
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
allow depreciation under several methods. The straight-line method assumes that a fixed asset loses its value in
proportion to its useful life
. The accelerated method assumes that the asset loses its value faster in its first years of use.
3
What's considered useful life varies according to the type of asset. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assigns office furniture and fixtures a useful life of seven years under the general depreciation system (GDS). Cars and trucks have a useful life of five years.
3
Financial Assets
Financial assets
can include stocks, corporate and government bonds, and other types of securities. They tend to be
liquid
unlike fixed assets and they're valued according to their current price on the relevant market.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are economic resources that have no physical presence. They include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. Intangible assets can be
amortized
over their useful life for accounting and tax purposes similar to the depreciation process for fixed assets.
4
Assets vs. Liabilities
An asset is something of economic value that's owned or controlled by a person, a company, or a government. A liability is the opposite. It's something that's owed to another person, company, or government. Examples of liabilities include loans, tax obligations, and
accounts payable
.
Explain Like I'm 5
An asset is something of value that you own or that's owed to you. The loan would be an asset if you lent money to someone because they're obligated to repay you that amount. The loan would be a liability for the person who owes you the money.
What Are Examples of Assets?
Personal assets can include a home, land, financial securities, jewelry, artwork, gold and silver, or your checking account. Business assets can include motor vehicles, buildings, machinery, equipment, cash, and accounts receivable as well as intangibles like patents and copyrights.
What Are Non-Physical Assets?
Non-physical or intangible assets provide an economic benefit even though you can't physically touch them. They're an important class of assets that include
intellectual property
such as patents or trademarks, contractual obligations, royalties, and goodwill.
Brand equity
and reputation are also examples of non-physical or intangible assets that can be quite valuable.
Is Labor an Asset?
No. Labor is work carried out by human beings for which they're paid in wages or a salary. Labor is distinct from assets which are considered to be
capital
.
How Are Current Assets Different From Fixed or Noncurrent Assets?
Assets are categorized in accounting by their time horizon of use. Current assets are expected to be sold or used within one year. Fixed assets, also known as
noncurrent assets
, are expected to remain in use for longer than one year. Fixed assets aren't easily liquidated so they can depreciate over time, unlike current assets.
The Bottom Line
Assets are anything of value that an individual, a business enterprise, or another entity owns. Different types of assets are treated differently for tax and accounting purposes. Assets are generally a good thing to have and liabilities less so.

Definition
Short selling is a trading strategy in which
a trader aims to profit from a decline in a security's price by borrowing shares and selling them, hoping the stock price will then fall, enabling them to purchase the shares back for less money.
Short selling is a trading strategy where investors speculate on a stock's decline. Short sellers bet on, and profit from a drop in a security’s price. Traders use short selling as
speculation
, and investors or portfolio managers may use it as a
hedge
against the
downside risk
of a long position.
Key Takeaways
Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, planning to repurchase later for less money.
Short sellers bet on and profit from, a drop in a security’s price.
Short selling has a high
risk/reward ratio
, offering big profits, but losses can mount quickly and may result in margin calls.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
How Shorting a Stock Works
Traders commonly engage in short selling for speculation and hedging. To open a short position, a trader must have a
margin account
and pay interest on the value of the borrowed shares while the position is open.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which enforces the rules and regulations governing registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States, the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
, and the
Federal Reserve
have set minimum values for the amount that the margin account must maintain—known as the
maintenance margin
.
1
A broker locates shares that can be borrowed and returns them at the end of the trade. Opening and closing the trade can be done through regular trading platforms with brokers qualified to perform margin trading.
A step-by-step process for short selling
To short-sell, traders commonly follow these steps:

Step 1 - Open a margin account
: Before they engage in short selling, traders open a margin account with a broker so that they will be able to borrow shares. Margin accounts require minimum balances, called the maintenance margin, which is used to cover potential losses. The broker charges interest on the borrowed shares while short positions remain open.
Step 2 - Identify a stock to short
: Next, traders identify stocks that they believe will decline in value by analyzing financial reports, industry trends, technical indicators, or broad market sentiment. This involves speculation based on the expectation that the stock's price will drop, allowing the trader to profit by buying it back later at a lower price.
Step 3 - Locate borrowable shares
: Before the trader can short-sell, the broker must locate shares that can be borrowed. Brokerage firms now handle this process automatically, finding shares from other clients' accounts or even institutional lenders.
Step 4 - Place the short sale order
: More than likely, the shares will be available on the brokerage platform, or a list of shares that can be shorted will be made available to the trader. The trader enters a market order or a limit order to short the stock.
Step 5 - Monitor the position
: After opening the short position, experienced traders actively monitor the market and the stock's performance. Since the trader sold borrowed shares, they're expecting the stock price to decline so that they can repurchase the stock at a lower price. However, if the stock price increases, their losses can grow. In theory, there is no limit to how high a stock price can rise. Traders also need to account for any interest charges on the borrowed shares and keep track of the margin requirements.
Important
If the stock price rises significantly and the value of the trader's account falls below the maintenance margin level, the broker will issue a margin call. This means the trader will need to deposit additional funds into their margin account to bring the account back to the required level. If the trader fails to meet the margin call, the broker may close the position automatically to prevent further losses.
Step 6 - Close the short position
: To close the short position, traders must buy back the borrowed shares and return them to the lender. This is known as covering the short. Ideally, the shares are repurchased at a lower price than what the trader sold them for, allowing the trader to keep the difference as profit, less interest charges and commissions. Closing the short position can be achieved by entering a buy order on the brokerage platform for the same number of shares that were sold short.
Step 7 - Review the trade outcome
: Experienced traders review the outcome of the transaction after the position is closed. Analyzing the trade's success or failure helps the trader refine their strategy for future short-selling opportunities.
How to Time a Short Sale
Timing is crucial when it comes to short selling. Stocks typically decline much faster than they advance, and a sizable gain in the stock may be wiped out with an earnings miss or other bearish development. Conversely, entering the trade too early may make it difficult to hold on to the short position in light of the costs involved and potential losses, which rise if the stock increases rapidly. Short sellers commonly look for opportunities during the following conditions:
Bear Market:
Traders who believe that “the trend is your friend” have a better chance of making profitable short-sale trades during an entrenched bear market than they would during a strong bull phase. Short sellers revel in environments where the market decline is swift, broad, and deep, to make windfall profits during such times.
Decline in Fundamentals:
A stock’s fundamentals can deteriorate for several reasons—slowing revenue or profit growth, increasing challenges to the business, and rising input costs that pressure margins. Worsening fundamentals could indicate an economic slowdown, adverse geopolitical developments like a threat of war, or bearish technical signals like new highs on decreasing volume.
Bearish Technical Indicators:
Short sales may succeed when technical indicators confirm the bearish trend. These indicators could include a breakdown below a key long-term support level or a bearish moving average crossover like the
death cross
. An example of a bearish moving average crossover occurs when a stock’s 50-day moving average falls below its 200-day moving average. A
moving average
is merely the average of a stock’s price over a set period. If the current price breaks the average, either down or up, it can signal a new trend in price.
High Valuations:
Occasionally, valuations for certain sectors or the market as a whole may reach highly elevated levels amid rampant optimism for the long-term prospects of such sectors or the broad economy. Market professionals call this phase of the investment cycle “priced for perfection,” since investors will invariably be disappointed at some point when their lofty expectations are not met. Rather than rushing in on the short side, experienced short sellers may wait until the market or sector rolls over and commences its downward phase.
Short Selling Costs
Unlike buying and holding stocks or investments, short selling involves significant costs in addition to the usual trading commissions paid to brokers. Some costs include:
Margin Interest:
Since short sales can only be made via margin accounts, the interest payable on short trades can add up, especially if short positions are kept open over an extended period.
Stock Borrowing Costs:
Shares that are difficult to borrow—because of high short interest, limited float, or any other reason—have “
hard-to-borrow
” fees that can be substantial. The fee is based on an annualized rate that can range from a small fraction of a percent to more than 100% of the value of the short trade and is
prorated
for the number of days that the short trade is open. The broker-dealer usually assesses the fee to the client’s account.
Dividends and Other Costs:
The short seller is responsible for making dividend payments on the shorted stock to the entity from which the stock was borrowed. For
shorted bonds
, they must pay the lender the coupon or interest owed.
Warning
Shorting is known as margin trading. Traders borrow money from the brokerage firm using the investment as
collateral

Definition
A leverage ratio indicates the amount of debt a company or institution carries compared to its assets or equity.
What Is a Leverage Ratio?
A leverage ratio is a measurement used to determine the relationship between a company's debt and assets. It can be used to measure the amount of capital in the form of debt and loans, or to assess a company's ability to meet its financial obligations.
Leverage ratios are important in business, finance, and economics because companies and institutions rely on a mixture of equity and debt to finance their operations. Knowing the amount of debt held is useful in evaluating whether it can be paid off as it comes due.
Key Takeaways
A leverage ratio is a type of financial measurement used in finance, business, and economics to evaluate the level of debt relative to another financial metric.
A leverage ratio may also be used to measure a company’s mix of operating expenses to get an idea of how changes in output will affect operating income.
Common leverage ratios include the debt-equity ratio, equity multiplier, degree of financial leverage, and consumer leverage ratio.
Laura Porter / Investopedia
How Does a Leverage Ratio Work?
Leverage ratios assess the ability of a company, institution, or individual to meet their financial obligations. Carrying too much debt can be dangerous for a company and its investors, but the debt may help fuel growth if a company’s operations can generate a higher rate of return than the interest rate on its loans.
Uncontrolled debt levels can lead to credit downgrades or even worse consequences. However, too few debts can also raise questions. A reluctance or inability to borrow may indicate that operating margins are tight.
Important
Several ratios can be categorized as leverage ratios. The main factors considered are debt, equity, assets, and interest expenses.
A leverage ratio might also be used to measure a company’s mix of
operating expenses
to get an idea of how changes in output will affect operating income. Operating costs can be fixed or variable. The mix will differ depending on the company and the industry.

Banks and Leverage Ratios
Banks are among the most leveraged institutions in the United States. The combination of fractional-reserve banking and
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)
protection has produced a banking environment with limited lending risks. The FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) review and restrict the leverage ratios for American banks.
1
These bodies restrict how much money a bank can lend relative to how much capital the bank devotes to its own assets. The level of capital is important because banks can ""write down"" the capital portion of their assets if total asset values drop. Assets financed by debt can't be written down because the bank's bondholders and depositors are owed these funds.
The Federal Reserve created guidelines for bank holding companies, but these restrictions vary depending on the rating assigned to the bank. Banks that experience rapid growth or face operational or financial difficulties are generally required to maintain higher leverage ratios.
2
Fast Fact
The
tier 1 leverage ratio
is most commonly used by regulators for banks.
3
4
The level of scrutiny paid to leverage ratios has increased since the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 when banks that were “
too big to fail
” were a calling card to make banks more solvent. These pressures haven’t gone away. Restrictions keep getting tighter.
5
Regulators proposed that banks with $100 billion or more in assets dramatically add to their capital cushions in 2023 following the collapse of several lenders. These restrictions limit the number of loans made because it's more difficult and more expensive for a bank to raise capital than it is to borrow funds. Higher capital requirements can reduce dividends or dilute share value if more shares are issued.
6
Types of Leverage Ratios
There are many different types of leverage ratios—here are a few.
Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is perhaps the most well-known financial leverage ratio. It's expressed as:
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Shareholders’ Equity
​United Parcel Service's long-term debt was $19.51 billion, and its total stockholders' equity was $15.68 billion in the quarter ending March 31, 2025. The company's D/E for the quarter was 1.24.
7
A D/E ratio greater than 2.0 typically indicates a risky scenario for an investor, but this yardstick can vary by industry. Businesses that require large
capital expenditures (CapEx)
, such as
utility and manufacturing companies
, might have to secure more loans than other companies.
A high debt/equity ratio generally indicates that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. This can result in volatile earnings as a result of the additional interest expense. It may increase the company's chances of default or bankruptcy if the company's interest expense grows too high.
Tip
It’s a good idea to measure a firm’s past leverage ratios and those of companies operating in the same industry to better understand the data.
Equity Multiplier
The equity multiplier is similar, but it replaces debt with assets in the numerator:
Equity Multiplier
=
Total Assets
Total Equity
\text{Equity Multiplier} = \frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Total Equity}}
Equity Multiplier
=
Total Equity
Total Assets
​
Assume that Macy's has assets valued at $19.85 billion and stockholder equity of $4.32 billion. The equity multiplier would be:
$
1
9
.
8
5
billion
÷
$
4
.
3
2
billion
=
4
.
5
9
\$19.85 \text{ billion} \div \$4.32 \text{ billion} = 4.59
$
1
9
.
8
5
billion
÷
$
4
.
3
2
billion
=
4
.
5
9
Debt isn't specifically referenced in the formula, but it's an underlying factor given that total assets include debt. The company's high ratio of 4.59 indicates that assets are mostly funded with debt rather than equity. Macy's assets are financed with $15.53 billion in liabilities.
The equity multiplier is a component of the
DuPont analysis
for calculating return on equity (ROE):

where:

It's generally better to have a low equity multiplier because this means that a company isn't incurring excessive debt to finance its assets.

The debt-to-capitalization ratio measures the amount of debt in a company's capital structure. It's calculated as:
Total debt to capitalization
=
(
S
D

(

\begin{aligned} &\text{Total debt to capitalization} = \frac{(SD + LD)}{(SD + LD + SE)}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &SD=\text{short-term debt}\\ &LD=\text{long-term debt}\\ &SE=\text{shareholders' equity}\\ \end{aligned}

Operating leases are capitalized, and equity includes both common and preferred shares. An analyst might decide to use total debt to measure the debt used in a firm's capital structure instead of using long-term debt. This formula would include minority interest and preferred shares in the denominator.
Degree of Financial Leverage
Degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company’s earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income as a result of changes in its capital structure. It measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and is calculated using the formula:

Investopedia,What Is a Marketing Strategy?,"Close
Definition
A marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan covering the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion, and whose goal is to reach potential customers.
What Is a Marketing Strategy?
A marketing strategy can sway consumers to buy a particular company's products or services. It may include multiple marketing ideas for each of the firm's sectors or product lines. A marketing strategy contains the company’s
value proposition
, key brand messaging, and data on target customer demographics.
Key Takeaways
A marketing strategy may include current or future marketing initiatives and detail a company's goals and timetables.
The success of a marketing strategy can be quantified through metrics like the number of new customers, revenue, and sales.
A marketing strategy may include advertising, outreach, and public relations campaigns.
Understanding Marketing Strategies
A clear marketing strategy should revolve around the company’s value proposition. This communicates to consumers what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves the customers' business. A well-constructed value proposition provides marketing teams with a template that should inform their initiatives across all of the company’s products and services.
The ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable
competitive advantage
over rival companies. To do this, a business must understand the needs and wants of its customers. Whether it’s a print ad design,
mass customization
, or a social media campaign, a marketing asset should effectively communicate a company’s core value proposition.
For example, Walmart (
WMT
) is widely known as a discount retailer with “everyday low prices.” Low prices are its value proposition, so all its business operations and marketing efforts are rooted in that idea, which appeals to its core consumer base.
1
Its marketing strategies may be found on TV, in print, or on the accounts of social media influencers, but they all emphasize the same value proposition of low prices on everyday products.
Fast Fact
Many companies use
market research
to identify what is most important to consumers and how to differentiate their products or services from those of competitors. This information can be used to identify untapped audiences and develop a plan for reaching them, which will increase sales and improve a company's bottom line.
Marketing Strategies vs. Marketing Plans
The marketing strategy is outlined in the
marketing plan
. This is a document that details the specific types of marketing activities a company will conduct in a given timeframe. It contains important information such as what the current and near-future marketing initiatives will be, how they will be conducted, what their goals are, and the timetables for enacting them. A company may have separate marketing initiatives for each of its products or services; it may also have multiple marketing initiatives for the same product or service that are implemented at different times or on different platforms.

Marketing strategies inform a business's marketing across many verticals and over a longer period. These strategies should ideally have longer life spans than individual marketing plans because they contain value propositions and other key elements of a company’s brand, which generally hold constant over the long haul.
Important
Marketing strategies cover big-picture messaging, while marketing plans delineate the logistical details of specific campaigns.
For example, a marketing strategy might say that a company aims to increase authority in niche circles where their clients visit. The marketing plan puts that into action by commissioning thought leadership pieces on LinkedIn.
How to Create a Marketing Strategy
Creating a thoughtful and effective marketing strategy requires several steps.
Identify Goals
While sales are the ultimate goal for every company, a marketing strategy can also include short-term goals such as:
Establishing authority
Increasing customer engagement
Generating leads
These smaller goals offer measurable benchmarks for the progress of your marketing plan. Think of strategy as the high-level ideology and planning as how you accomplish your goals.
Create a Customer Profile
Every product or service has an ideal customer, and you should have a profile outlining what you know about yours. It can include:
Who they are
What they are most interested in
What problems they want to solve
What is holding them back from solving those problems
What solutions your competitors offer them
What types of media are ideal for reaching them
If you sell power tools, for example, you’ll choose marketing channels where general contractors may see your messaging. This could be TV ads, or it might be social media accounts focused on home renovation and DIY.
Develop a Message
Now that you know your goals and who you’re pitching to, it’s time to create your message. Your clients have a problem that needs to be solved and something that is standing in the way of that solution. Your marketing message needs to communicate how your product or service will solve their problem and improve their lives.
This is also when you differentiate your solution from the one provided by your competitors and show how it's the best option for your customers.
Define Your Budget
How you disperse your messaging may depend on how much you can afford. Will you be purchasing advertising? Working with thought leaders or influencers? Hoping for a viral moment on social media organically? Sending out press releases to the media to try to gain coverage?
Your budget will dictate what you can afford to do.
Select Your Channels
Even the best message won't work unless it is communicated through the appropriate medium. Selecting the best channel for your marketing efforts will depend on who your customers are, who they trust, what types of media they consume, and what budget you have to work with.
Some companies may find the most value in creating blog posts for their website. Others may find success with paid ads on social media channels. Find the most appropriate venue for your content.
Track Measurable Benchmarks
To target your marketing, you need to know whether it is reaching its audience. Determine your metrics and how you’ll judge the success of your marketing efforts. Make sure these are clearly defined and measurable. For example, you may decide to track:
New leads
Customer signups
Revenue
Sales of an individual product
Social media followers
Customer retention
New accounts opened
Which metrics you track will depend on the goals of your marketing campaign and the type of business you are running.
Explain Like I'm Five
A marketing strategy is a plan by a company or organization to reach prospective customers and persuade them to buy its products. As part of its marketing strategy, a business will identify its target customers, determine what those customers want, and engage with those customers through advertisements and promotions. An effective marketing strategy will focus on a specific goal, like increasing sales or raising brand awareness.
What Do the 4 Ps Mean in a Marketing Strategy?
The
four Ps
are product, price, promotion, and place. These are the key factors that are involved in the marketing of a good or service. The four Ps can be used when planning a new business venture, evaluating an existing offer, or trying to optimize sales with a target audience. They can also be used to test a current marketing strategy on a new audience.
What Does a Marketing Strategy Look Like?
A marketing strategy will detail the advertising, outreach, and public relations campaigns to be carried out by a firm, including how the company will measure the effect of these initiatives. The functions and components of a marketing plan include market research, tailored messaging that targets certain demographics and geographic areas, platform selection, and metrics that measure the results of marketing efforts and their reporting timelines.
Is a Marketing Strategy the Same As a Marketing Plan?
The terms “marketing plan” and “marketing strategy” are often used interchangeably because a marketing plan is developed based on an overarching strategic framework. The plan outlines marketing activities on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, while the marketing strategy outlines the overall value proposition. In some cases, the strategy and the plan may be incorporated into one document, particularly for smaller companies that may only run one or two major campaigns in a year.
The Bottom Line
Companies need to sell their products and services to generate revenue and put them on the path of being a successful business. To sell their products or services, they have to let consumers know of them. They must also convince consumers to buy them as well as convert consumers from competitors. Having a marketing strategy that outlines this process and more is a crucial step in converting consumers into customers.

The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities to determine how well a company can meet all financial obligations due within a year.
What Is the Current Ratio?
The current ratio is a common
liquidity ratio
used to judge whether or not a company can pay current obligations.
It tells investors and analysts if a company can maximize the
current assets
on its balance sheet to meet its current debt payments and other payables due within a year.
A current ratio that is in line with the industry average or slightly higher is generally considered acceptable.
A current ratio that is lower than the industry average may indicate a higher risk of financial distress or default by the company.
If a company has a very high current ratio compared with its peer group, it indicates that management may not be using its assets efficiently.

The current ratio is called current because, unlike some other liquidity ratios, it incorporates all current assets and current liabilities. It is sometimes called the
working capital
ratio.
Key Takeaways
The current ratio divides all of a company’s current assets by its current liabilities.
The current ratio helps investors understand a company’s ability to cover its short-term debt and bills.
It can be used to compare a company to its competitors and peers.
Industries have different expected or average current ratios, so it shouldn't be used to compare companies in different industries.
Others limitations include the overgeneralization of the specific asset and liability balances, as well as the lack of trending information.
Investors and lenders also use the current ratio as an indicator of a company's financial health and risk profile.
Investopedia / Lara Antal
Understanding the Current Ratio
Investors, analysts, and companies need to know whether a business can pay what it owes.
The current ratio provides a measure of this capability by weighing current (short-term) liabilities (debts and payables) against current assets (cash, inventory, and receivables).
1
In many cases, a company with a current ratio of less than 1.00 would not have the capital on hand to meet its short-term financial obligations should they all come due at once.
A current ratio greater than 1.00 indicates that the company has the financial resources to remain solvent in the short term.
This is useful information. However, because the current ratio is a snapshot of a particular moment in time, it is usually not considered a complete representation of a company’s short-term
liquidity
or longer-term
solvency
.
For example, a company may have a very high current ratio, but its
accounts receivable may be very aged
, perhaps because its customers pay slowly, which may be hidden in the current ratio. Some of the accounts receivable may even need to be written off.
Analysts also must consider the quality of a company’s other assets vs. its obligations. If the
inventory is unable to be sold
, the current ratio may look acceptable even though the company may be headed for default.
In general, the higher the current ratio, the more capable a company is of paying its obligations. It has a larger proportion of short-term asset value relative to the value of its short-term liabilities.
Note though that a high ratio—say, more than 3.00—could indicate that although the company can cover its current liabilities three times, it may not be using its current assets efficiently, securing financing very well, or
properly managing its working capital
.
This is why it is helpful to compare a company's current ratio to those of similarly-sized businesses within the same industry.
Important
Public companies don't report their current ratio, though all the information needed to calculate the it is contained in the company's financial statements.
Formula and Calculation for the Current Ratio
To calculate the ratio, compare current assets to current liabilities.
Current Ratio
=
Current assets
Current liabilities
\begin{aligned} &\text{Current Ratio}=\frac{\text{Current assets}}{ \text{Current liabilities}} \end{aligned}
​
Current Ratio
=
Current liabilities
Current assets
​
​
Current assets listed on a company’s balance sheet include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets (OCA) that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash in less than one year.
Current liabilities include accounts payable, wages, taxes payable, short-term debts, and the current portion of long-term debt.
Using the Current Ratio
A current ratio of less than 1.00 may seem alarming, but a single ratio doesn't always offer a complete picture of a company's finances.
For example, a normal cycle for the company’s collections and payment processes may lead to a high current ratio as payments are received, but a low current ratio as those collections ebb.
Calculating the current ratio at one point in time could indicate that the company can’t cover all of its current debts, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t be able to when the payments are due.
As another example, large retailers often negotiate much longer-than-average payment terms with their suppliers. If a retailer doesn’t offer credit to its customers, this can show on its balance sheet as a high payables balance relative to its receivables balance.
Large retailers can also minimize their inventory volume through an efficient
supply chain
, which makes their current assets shrink against current liabilities, resulting in a lower current ratio.
The current ratio can be a useful measure of a company’s short-term solvency when it is placed in the context of what has been historically normal for the company and its peer group.
It also offers more insight when calculated regularly over several periods. That is, changes in the current ratio over time can often offer a clearer picture of a company's finances.
A company that seems to have an acceptable current ratio could be trending toward a situation in which it will struggle to pay its bills. Conversely, a company that may appear to be struggling now could be making good progress toward a healthier current ratio.
In the first case, the trend of the current ratio over time would be expected to harm the company’s valuation. Meanwhile, an improving current ratio could indicate an opportunity to invest in an undervalued stock amid a turnaround.
Example of Current Ratio
Imagine two companies with a current ratio of 1.00 today. Though they may appear to have the same level of risk, analysts would have different expectations for each company depending on how the current ratio of each had changed over time.
2020
2021

Company B

1.17
1.35
1.05
1.02
1.00
Company B
In this example, the trend for Company B is negative, meaning the current ratio is decreasing over time.
An analyst or investor seeing these numbers would need to investigate further to see what is causing the negative trend.
It could be a sign that the company is taking on too much debt or that its cash balance is being depleted, either of which could be a solvency issue if the trend worsens.
Company A
On the other hand, the trend for Company A is positive. This could indicate that the company has better collections, faster
inventory turnover
, or simply a better ability to pay down its debt.
The trend is also more stable, with all the values being relatively close together and no sudden jumps or increases from year to year.
An investor or analyst looking at this trend over time could conclude that the company's finances are likely more stable, too.
This is markedly different from Company B's current ratio, which demonstrates a higher level of
volatility
.
There were wider swings from 2020 to 2021. This could mean the shorter-term resources are more inconsistent, making the company perhaps a bit riskier or more unpredictable.
Current Ratio vs. Other Liquidity Ratios
Similar liquidity ratios can supplement a current ratio analysis. They can help an investor understand the current status of the company’s assets and liabilities from different angles, as well as how those accounts are changing over time.

Definition
Net worth is the monetary value of the assets owned by an individual or business entity after subtracting the total value of their liabilities.
What Is Net Worth?
Net worth is the value of an individual's or company's
assets
minus their
liabilities
. The figure for net worth provides a snapshot of a person's or company's financial position and well-being.
Net worth is used to qualify certain people or entities for particular investment strategies or financial products such as hedge funds, structured products, other complex or alternative investments, or loans.
Net worth has also become a fixation of popular culture with lists ranking the people with the
highest net worth
as well as the net worth of various celebrities.
Key Takeaways
Net worth compares assets to liabilities.
A positive net worth is healthy, a negative net worth is not (although it may be temporary).
Individuals, corporations, sectors, and even countries can have a net worth.
Net worth is commonly referred to in business as book value or shareholders’ equity.
People with substantial net worth are called high-net-worth individuals.
Joules Garcia / Investopedia
How to Calculate Net Worth
Net worth is calculated by subtracting all liabilities from all assets.
Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth

An asset is anything owned that has monetary value. Liabilities are obligations that deplete financial resources. They include loans,
accounts payable (AP)
, and mortgages.
Net worth can be described as either positive or negative. Positive net worth means that assets exceed liabilities. Negative net worth indicates that liabilities exceed assets.
Positive and increasing net worth indicates good
financial health
. Decreasing net worth is cause for concern because it might signal a decrease in assets relative to liabilities.
The best ways to improve net worth are to reduce liabilities while assets stay constant or rise in value, or increase assets while liabilities remain constant or decrease.
Tip
Keeping track of your net worth over time is a good way to keep the focus on your efforts to save and to control your spending. Knowing your net worth and which way it's moving gives you a perspective on changes you may need to make for your financial goals and security.
Negative Net Worth
A
negative net worth
results when the value of your debts exceeds the value of your assets.
So, for example, your net worth will be negative if the sum of your credit card bills, utility bills, outstanding mortgage payments, auto loan bills, and student loans is greater than the sum of your cash, savings, investments, and other property.
Negative net worth is a sign that an individual or family needs to focus its energy on debt reduction. A tough budget, the use of debt reduction strategies (like the
debt snowball or debt avalanche
), and perhaps debt negotiation can sometimes help people climb out of a negative net worth hole and start building up their financial resources.
It's Not Uncommon
A negative net worth isn’t uncommon early in life. Student loans mean that even those young people who are careful with their money can start out owing more than they own.
Family responsibilities or an unexpected illness can also push people into the red.
Filing for bankruptcy protection
to eliminate some of the debt and prevent creditors from trying to collect on it might be the most appropriate solution when nothing else has worked.
Some liabilities
can’t be discharged
, however. They include child support, alimony, taxes, and often
student loans
. And many types of bankruptcy will stay on an individual’s
credit report
for 10 years.
1
Net Worth in Business
Net worth is known as book value or
shareholders’ equity
in business. The
balance sheet
is also known as a net worth statement.
The value of a company’s equity equals the difference between the value of total assets and total liabilities. The values on a company’s balance sheet highlight historical costs or book values rather than current market values.
Lenders scrutinize a business’s net worth to determine whether it’s financially healthy. A
creditor
might not be too confident in a company’s ability to repay its loans if total liabilities exceed total assets.
A consistently profitable company will register a rising net worth or
book value
provided that these earnings aren’t fully distributed to shareholders as dividends.
A rising book value will often be accompanied by an increase in the value of a
public company
’s stock price.
Fast Fact
Net worth can apply to individuals, companies, sectors, and even countries, and is sometimes referred to as net wealth.
Net Worth in Personal Finance
An individual’s net worth
is the value that’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets. Liabilities include debts like
mortgages
, credit card balances, student loans, and car loans.
Liabilities can also include obligations such as bills and taxes that must be paid.
An individual’s assets can include balances in checking and savings accounts, the value of retirement accounts, the value of taxable accounts (with securities such as stocks or bonds), real property value, and the
market value
of an automobile.
Literally, their net worth is whatever’s left after selling all assets and paying off personal liabilities. Normally, though, net worth is tallied by simply adding up the value of the assets and then subtracting from that figure the amount for liabilities.
People with substantial net worth are known as
high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs)
. They are the target market for certain wealth managers and investment advisors.
Investors with net worths of at least $1 million either alone or together with their spouse and excluding their primary residences are ""accredited"" investors in the eyes of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
. That means they’re permitted to invest in
unregistered securities
offerings.
Example of Net Worth
Consider a couple with the following assets:
Primary residence valued at $250,000
An investment
portfolio
with a market value of $100,000
Automobiles and other assets valued at $25,000
Liabilities are:
An outstanding mortgage balance of $100,000
A car loan of $10,000
The couple’s net worth would therefore be calculated like this:
($250,000 + $100,000 + $25,000) - ($100,000 + $10,000) = $265,000
Assume that the couple's financial position changes five years later. Their residence's value is $225,000, their investment portfolio is $120,000, their savings total $20,000, and their automobile and other assets are valued at $15,000.
Their mortgage loan balance is $80,000, and the car loan is $0 because it was paid off. Their net worth would be:
($225,000 + $120,000 + $20,000 + $15,000) - $80,000 = $300,000
The couple’s net worth has gone up by $35,000 despite the decrease in the value of their residence and car.
These declines were more than offset by an increase in their investment portfolio's value and their savings plus the drop in liabilities.
What Is a Good Net Worth?
A good net worth
varies for every individual according to their life circumstances, financial needs, and lifestyle. The median net worth of a family in the United States rose to $192,700 in 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
2
How Do I Calculate My Net Worth?
Simply subtract your total liabilities from your total assets. Your total assets include everything you own with a monetary value—your investments, savings, cash deposits, and any equity that you have in a home, car, or other similar assets. Total liabilities include any debt, such as student loans and credit card debt.
How Much Should I Have Saved?
What you should have saved depends on your age, your career, your lifestyle, and your life’s circumstances. Fidelity recommends having saved three times your annual salary across all of your retirement accounts by the time you’re 40.

The Bottom Line
Net worth is a good way to assess the
true wealth
of an individual or business. Looking only at someone’s assets can be misleading because this total is often offset by some amount of debt and other liabilities.

Definition
Operating margin is a company's profit for every dollar of sales after deducting production costs like wages and raw materials but before accounting for interest and taxes.
What Is Operating Margin?
A company's operating margin is the amount it makes on every dollar of sales after deducting the
variable costs
involved but before accounting for interest or taxes. Operating margin is calculated by dividing the company’s operating income by its
net sales
.
A higher ratio in an operating margin is generally better, as it indicates the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits.
Key Takeaways
A company's operating margin indicates how effective it is at generating a profit through its core operations.
The formula for operating margin yields the percentage profit made on each dollar of sales.
Operating margin is reduced by the company's variable costs of production but does not consider the costs of interest or taxes (EBIT).
To calculate operating margin, divide operating income (earnings) by sales (revenues).
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding the Operating Margin
A company’s operating margin, sometimes referred to as
return on sales
(ROS), is a good indicator of how well it is being managed and how efficient it is at generating profits from sales. It shows the proportion of revenues that are available to cover non-operating costs, such as paying
interest
, which is why investors and lenders pay close attention to it.
Highly variable operating margins are a prime indicator of business risk. By the same token, looking at a company’s past operating margins is a good way to gauge whether a company's performance has been getting better. The operating margin can improve through better management controls, more efficient use of resources, improved pricing, and more effective marketing.
In its essence, the operating margin is how much profit a company makes from its core business in relation to its total revenues. This allows investors to see if a company is generating income primarily from its core operations or from other means, such as investing.

Calculating the Operating Margin
The formula for operating margin is:
Operating Margin
=
Operating Earnings
Revenue
\begin{aligned} \text{Operating Margin}=\frac{\text{Operating Earnings}}{\text{Revenue}} \end{aligned}
Operating Margin
=
Revenue
Operating Earnings
​
​
﻿﻿
When calculating operating margin, the numerator uses a firm's
earnings before interest and taxes
(EBIT). EBIT, or
operating earnings
, is calculated simply as revenue minus
cost of goods sold
(COGS) and the regular selling, general, and administrative costs of running a business, excluding interest and taxes.
Example
For example, if a company had revenues of $2 million, COGS of $700,000, and
administrative expenses
of $500,000, its operating earnings would be $2 million - ($700,000 + $500,000) = $800,000. Its operating margin would then be $800,000 / $2 million = 40%.
If the company was able to negotiate better prices with its suppliers, reducing its COGS to $500,000, then it would see an improvement in its operating margin to 50%.
Limitations of the Operating Margin
The operating margin should only be used to compare companies that operate in the same industry and, ideally, have similar
business models
and annual sales. Companies in different industries with wildly different business models have very different operating margins, so comparing them would be meaningless. It would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.
To make it easier to compare profitability
between companies and industries
, many analysts use a profitability ratio that eliminates the effects of financing, accounting, and tax policies:
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
(EBITDA). For example, by adding back depreciation, the operating margins of big manufacturing firms and heavy industrial companies are more comparable.
EBITDA is sometimes used as a proxy for
operating cash flow
because it excludes non-cash expenses, such as depreciation. However, EBITDA does not equal cash flow. This is because it does not adjust for any increase in
working capital
or account for capital expenditure that is needed to support production and maintain a company’s asset base—as operating cash flow does.
Other Profit Margins
By comparing EBIT to sales,
operating profit margins
show how successful a company's management has been at generating income from the operation of the business.  There are several other margin calculations that businesses and analysts can employ to get slightly different insights into a firm's profitability.
The
gross margin
tells us how much profit a company makes on its cost of sales or COGS. In other words, it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process.
The
net margin
considers the net profits generated from all segments of a business, accounting for all costs and accounting items incurred, including taxes and depreciation. In other words, this ratio compares
net income
with sales. It comes as close as possible to summing up in a single figure how effectively the managers are running a business.
Why Is Operating Margin Important?
The operating margin is an important measure of a company's overall profitability from operations. It is the ratio of operating profits to revenues for a company or business segment.
Expressed as a percentage, the operating margin shows how much earnings from operations is generated from every $1 in sales after accounting for the direct costs involved in earning those revenues. Larger margins mean that more of every dollar in sales is kept as profit.
How Can Companies Improve Their Operating Profit Margin?
When a company's operating margin exceeds the average for its industry, it is said to have a
competitive advantage
, meaning it is more successful than other companies that have similar operations. While the average margin for different industries varies widely, businesses can gain a competitive advantage in general by
increasing sales or reducing expenses
—or both.
Boosting sales, however, often involves spending more money to do so, which equals greater costs. Cutting too many costs can also lead to undesirable outcomes, including losing skilled workers, shifting to inferior materials, or other losses in quality. Cutting advertising budgets may also harm sales.
To reduce the cost of production without sacrificing quality, the best option for many businesses is expansion.
Economies of scale
refer to the idea that larger companies tend to be more profitable. A large business's increased level of production means that the cost of each item is reduced in several ways. For example, raw materials purchased in bulk are often discounted by wholesalers.
How Is Operating Margin Different From Other Profit Margin Measures?
Operating margin takes into account all operating costs but excludes any non-operating costs. Net profit margin takes into account all costs involved in a sale, making it the most comprehensive and conservative measure of profitability. Gross margin, on the other hand, simply looks at the costs of goods sold (COGS) and ignores things such as
overhead
, fixed costs, interest expenses, and taxes.
What Are Some High and Low Profit Margin Industries?
High-profit margin sectors are typically those where competitive pressures allow companies to generate sales that are produced without having to spend much on development, marketing, overheads, and production. Initially, start-up companies may make losses until they establish themselves. For example, software or gaming companies may invest initially while developing a particular software/game and cash in big later by simply selling millions of copies with very few expenses.
Operations-intensive businesses such as transportation, which may have to deal with fluctuating fuel prices, drivers’ perks and retention, and vehicle maintenance, usually have lower profit margins. Automobiles also have low profit margins, as profits and sales are limited by intense competition, uncertain consumer demand, and high operational expenses involved in developing dealership networks and logistics.

What Are Quick Assets?
Quick assets refer to assets owned by a company with a commercial or exchange value that can easily be converted into cash or that are already in a cash form. Quick assets are therefore considered to be the most highly
liquid assets
held by a company. They include cash and equivalents,
marketable securities
, and accounts receivable. Companies use quick assets to calculate certain financial ratios that are used in decision making, primarily the
quick ratio
.
Key Takeaways
Current and quick assets are two categories from the balance sheet that analysts use to examine a company’s liquidity.
Quick assets are equal to the summation of a company’s cash and equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable which are all assets that represent or can be easily converted to cash.
Quick assets are considered to be a more conservative measure of a company's liquidity than current assets since it excludes inventories.
The quick ratio is used to analyze a company's immediate ability to pay its current liabilities without the need to sell its inventory or use financing.
The Basics of Quick Assets
Unlike other types of
assets
, quick assets represent economic resources that can be turned into cash in a relatively short period of time without a significant loss of value. Cash and cash equivalents are the most liquid current asset items included in quick assets, while marketable securities and accounts receivable are also considered to be quick assets. Quick assets exclude
inventories
, because it may take more time for a company to convert them into cash.
Companies typically keep some portion of their quick assets in the form of cash and marketable securities as a buffer to meet their immediate operating, investing, or financing needs. A company that has a low cash balance in its quick assets may satisfy its need for liquidity by tapping into its available lines of credit.
Depending on the nature of a business and the industry in which it operates, a substantial portion of quick assets may be tied to accounts receivable. For example, companies that sell products and services to corporate clients may have large accounts receivable balances, while retail companies that sell products to individual consumers may have negligible accounts receivable on their balance sheets.
Example of Quick Assets: The Quick Ratio
Analysts most often use quick assets to assess a company's ability to satisfy its immediate bills and obligations that are due within a one-year period. The total amount of quick assets is used in the quick ratio, sometimes referred to as the acid test, which is a financial ratio that divides the sum of a company's cash and equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable by its
current liabilities
. This ratio allows investment professionals to determine whether a company can meet its financial obligations if its revenues or cash collections happen to slow down.
The formula for the quick ratio is:

Quick Assets Versus Current Assets
Quick assets offer analysts a more conservative view of a company’s liquidity or ability to meet its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets because it doesn't include harder to sell inventory and
other current assets
that can be difficult to liquidate. By excluding inventory, and other less liquid assets, the quick assets focus on the company’s most liquid assets.
The quick ratio can also be contrasted against the current ratio, which is equal to a company's total
current assets
, including its inventories, divided by its current liabilities. The quick ratio represents a more stringent test for the liquidity of a company in comparison to the current ratio.
Fast Fact
The word quick originates with the Old English cwic, which meant ""alive"" or ""alert.""

Definition
Perfect competition is a market structure used in economic theory as a benchmark. In this model, there are low barriers of entry and no monopolies.
What Is Perfect Competition?
Perfect competition, also known as pure competition, is an idealized market condition in which many sellers compete to offer the best prices, and large sellers have no advantages over smaller ones. Perfect competition rarely occurs in real-world markets, but it provides a useful framework for understanding how supply and demand influence prices and behavior in a market economy.
There are many buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market, and prices are determined purely by supply and demand. Companies earn just enough profit to stay in business and no more. Other companies would enter the market and drive profits down if they were to earn excess profits.
Key Takeaways
Perfect competition is an ideal type of market structure where all producers and consumers have full and symmetric information and no transaction costs.
There are a large number of producers and consumers competing with each other in this kind of environment.
Perfect competition is theoretically the opposite of a monopolistic market.
All real markets exist outside of the plane of the perfect competition model, so each can be classified as imperfect.
The opposite of perfect competition is imperfect competition, which exists when a market violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
How Perfect Competition Works
Perfect competition is a benchmark or ideal type to which real-life market structures can be compared. Pure competition is
theoretically the opposite
of a monopoly, in which only a single firm supplies a good or service. That firm can charge whatever price it wants because consumers have no alternatives, and it's difficult for would-be competitors to enter the marketplace.
There are no monopolies in a perfect competition model. This kind of structure has several key characteristics:
1
All firms sell an identical product. It's a commodity or homogeneous.
All firms are price takers. They can't influence the market price of their products.
Market share doesn't influence prices.
Buyers have complete or perfect information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm in the past, present, and future.
Capital resources and labor are perfectly mobile.
Firms can enter or exit the market without cost.
This can be contrasted with the more realistic imperfect competition that exists whenever a hypothetical or real market violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition.
All real markets exist outside the plane of the perfect competition model, so each can be classified as imperfect. The contemporary theory of imperfect versus perfect competition stems from the Cambridge tradition of post-classical economic thought.
Characteristics of Perfect Competition
A perfectly competitive market is defined by several factors.
A Large and Homogeneous Market
A large number of buyers and sellers exist in a perfectly competitive market. The sellers are small firms rather than large
corporations
that are capable of controlling prices through supply adjustments. They sell products with minimal differences in capabilities, features, and pricing. This ensures that buyers can't distinguish between products based on physical attributes, such as size or color, or intangible values, such as branding.
A large population of both buyers and sellers ensures that supply and demand remain constant in this market. Buyers can easily substitute products made by one firm for others.
Perfect Information Availability
Information about an industry's ecosystem and competition constitutes a significant advantage. Knowledge about component sourcing and supplier pricing can make or break the market for certain companies.
Information about patents and competitors' research initiatives can help companies develop competitive strategies and build a moat around their products in certain knowledge and research-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals and technology.
Fast Fact
The availability of free and perfect information in a perfectly competitive market ensures that each firm can produce its goods or services at the same rate and with the same production techniques as another in the market.
Absence of Controls
Governments play a vital role in market formation for products by imposing regulations and price controls. They can control the entry and exit of firms into a market by setting up rules to function in it. The pharmaceutical industry must contend with a roster of rules governing the development, production, and sale of drugs.
2
These rules require significant
capital investments
in the form of employees, such as lawyers and quality assurance personnel, as well as infrastructure, such as machinery to manufacture medicines. The cumulative costs add up and make it extremely expensive for companies to bring a drug to the market.
3
The technology industry functions with relatively less oversight as compared to its pharma counterpart. Entrepreneurs in this industry can start firms with less capital, making it easy for individuals to start a company in the industry.
Such controls don't exist in a perfectly competitive market. The entry and exit of firms are unregulated, and this frees them up to spend on labor and capital assets without restrictions and adjust their output in relation to market demands.
Cheap and Efficient Transportation
Cheap and efficient transportation is another characteristic of perfect competition. Companies don't incur significant costs to transport goods in this type of market. This helps reduce the product's price and cuts back on delays in transporting goods.
Theory vs. Reality of Perfect Competition
Real-world competition differs from this ideal primarily due to
differentiation in production, marketing, and sales
. The owner of a small organic products shop can advertise extensively about the grain fed to the cows that made the manure that fertilized the non-GMO soybeans, thereby setting their product apart from competitors. This is referred to as differentiation.
Homogeneous products and price takers are far from realistic, but the global tech and trade transformation is improving information and resource flexibility. The reality is far from this theoretical model, but the model is still helpful because of its ability to explain many real-life behaviors.
Important
Companies seek to establish brand value through marketing around their differentiation. They advertise to gain pricing power and market share.
Barriers to Entry Prohibit Perfect Competition
Many industries also have significant
barriers to entry
, such as high startup costs, as seen in the auto manufacturing industry, or strict government regulations, as seen in the utility industry. These limit the ability of firms to enter and exit such industries. Consumer awareness has increased with the information age, but there are still very few industries where the buyer remains aware of all available products and prices.
Significant obstacles exist that prevent perfect competition from developing in the economy. The agricultural industry probably comes closest to exhibiting perfect competition because it's characterized by many small producers with virtually no ability to alter the selling price of their products.
The commercial buyers of agricultural commodities are generally very well-informed, and it's not particularly difficult to enter the marketplace as a producer, although agricultural production does involve some barriers to entry.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Perfect Competition
Perfect competition is an idealized framework for a market economy. It provides a convenient model for how an economy works, but it's not always accurate and has significant departures from the real-world economy. The value of a perfect competition framework is only accurate to the extent that it reflects actual conditions.
One notable feature of perfect competition is low profit margins. All consumers have access to the same products, so they naturally gravitate toward the lowest prices. Firms can't set themselves apart by charging a premium for higher-quality products and services. It would be impossible for a company like Apple (
AAPL
) to exist in a perfectly competitive market because its phones are more expensive than those of its competitors.
Another issue is the absence of innovation. The prospect of greater market ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp
Investopedia,"Assets Under Management (AUM): Definition, Calculation, and Example","Close
Definition
Assets under management (AUM) is the current value of all the investments entrusted to a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund (ETF), or an investment company.
What Are Assets Under Management (AUM)?
Assets under management (AUM) is the total market value of the investments held by a portfolio manager or investment company on behalf of clients. It is the total pool of money invested.
The AUM of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the total amount of money invested in the fund. Similarly, your personal AUM is the amount you have invested.
Investors consider AUM among other factors in choosing an investment or an investment company.
Key Takeaways
A fund or company's AUM fluctuates constantly, reflecting market conditions and the buying and selling activity of participants.
Investors consider a large AUM as an indicator of stability and liquidity.
A substantial AUM suggests that it is easy to sell shares, as the fund has plenty of liquidity.
Fund management fees and expenses are often calculated as a percentage of the investor's AUM.
Understanding Assets Under Management (AUM)
AUM is a relevant number when looking at an investment fund or family of funds, a venture capital firm, a brokerage company, or an individual registered as an investment advisor or
portfolio manager
.
When calculating AUM, some financial institutions include bank deposits,
mutual funds
, and cash, while others limit it to funds from individual investors that are under their discretionary management.

AUM includes the capital the manager can use to make transactions for one or all clients. An investor may need a minimum amount of personal AUM to qualify for a type of investment, such as a hedge fund. An investor’s AUM may determine the type of services received from a
financial advisor
or brokerage company.
When an investor has $50,000 in a mutual fund, that money is counted in the total AUM of the fund. The fund manager can buy and sell shares without obtaining special permission from the client, as long as the stated investment objectives are followed.
Important
Investors often consider a higher AUM as a positive indicator of management quality.
Calculating AUM
The calculation for assets under management varies somewhat among companies and depends on the flow of investor money in and out of a fund. The numbers also fluctuate constantly in response to the ups and downs of the markets and the amount of cash deposited or withdrawn by its investors.
Asset performance
, capital appreciation, and reinvested dividends increase the AUM of a fund. Assets under management also increase when new customers sign on.
A decrease in AUM occurs following losses in the market value, fund closures, and decreased investor inflows.
Calculating AUM involves aggregating the total market value of all assets that an investment manager oversees on behalf of clients. This can include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, cash equivalents, and other types of securities.
The process entails identifying and valuing each asset held within client portfolios, taking into account factors such as current market prices, fair values, and any applicable currency conversions.
Once the market values of all assets are determined, they are all added together to get AUM.
AUM and SEC Regulation
The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires most firms with AUM ranging between $25 million to $110 million to register with the SEC, depending on several factors, including the size and location of the firm.
1
In addition, state securities regulators have authority over advisers handling up to $100 million. Advisers with assets under management below $100 million are required to register with the securities regulator of the state where their principal place of business is located.

If a state-registered adviser's AUM hits the $100 million threshold, the company may choose to register with the SEC. Once the company's AUM surpasses $110 million, registration with the SEC is usually mandatory.

AUM and Fees
AUM can be a consideration when calculating fees. Many investment products charge
management fees
as a fixed percentage of the investor's AUM. Financial advisors and personal money managers also charge their clients a fee as a percentage of personal assets under management.
The relationship between AUM and fees is not necessarily straightforward. For example, you may assume that as an investor's AUM increases, so do the fees earned by investment managers.
However, it is essential to recognize that fee structures can vary widely across different investment products and client segments. For example, actively managed funds may charge higher fees than passively managed funds due to the active management and research involved.
Another exception to this is for larger, institutional clients. Institutional clients may negotiate lower fee rates than retail clients due to the large size of their investments and their bargaining power. Management firms may also proactively lower their fees to entice large investors.
Therefore, higher AUM doesn't always mean higher fees.
AUM and Investment Management Strategy
One of the ultimate goals of an investment firm is to increase its AUM. This means that the company has more money to invest, giving it greater leverage for future growth.
Though also not necessarily tied to quantitative financial analysis, client acquisition strategies also play a role in AUM growth. Investment firms can prioritize identifying and acquiring new clients who align with the investment manager's target market and investment objectives in order to grow AUM.
Product
differentiation
is another important aspect of AUM growth strategies. This involves developing innovative investment products and solutions that address evolving market trends, investor preferences, and regulatory requirements.
For instance, State Street Corp. highlights ""State Street Alpha"" in its 2023 annual report, an architecture platform used to interpret data at a large scale.
3
New products like this can help a firm bring in capital from new or existing customers.
AUM and Investor Psychology
Investor psychology plays a role in growing the AUM of a fund or an investment company. During periods of optimism, investors may allocate more capital to investment vehicles. In pessimistic times, investors may withdraw funds or reallocate assets to
safe havens
, resulting in declines in AUM.
Behavioral biases such as herd behavior can play a factor as well. Beginning investors may choose to invest in the ETFs or investment companies that have the highest AUM. This can play into a dangerous cycle where investors follow the money rather than choose carefully.
Example of AUM
The
SPDR S&P 500 ETF
(SPY) is an
exchange-traded fund
that, as the name implies, holds shares in all of the companies listed in the S&P 500 Index.
As of April 24, 2025, SPY's assets under management totaled more than $572 billion.
4
The firm that manages the fund, State Street Corp., manages more than 200 mutual funds and ETFs in addition to SPY. As of the end of 2024, the global investment firm had AUM of $4.7 trillion.
5
Explain Like I'm Five
As an investor, you may be interested in noting the assets under management of a fund you are interested in, or a portfolio manager you might do business with.
A huge AUM number suggests that a large number of investors (or a number of very large investors) have entrusted their money to this fund or manager in the expectation that it will grow.
A small number of AUM might suggest that the fund or manager is not attracting large-scale investment for whatever reason. It may be a niche fund, a young fund, or an increasingly unattractive fund. More research is indicated.
One note: A large AUM for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) indicates optimism about the benchmark the fund tracks, more than it does confidence in the company that sponsors the fund. The vast majority of ETFs are passively managed, not actively managed.
How Is AUM Used As a Tool by Investment Companies?
Investment companies use assets under management as a marketing tool to attract new investors. AUM helps investors determine the size of a company's operations relative to that of its competitors.
What Does AUM Tell Potential Investors?
When evaluating a specific fund, investors often look at its AUM as an indication of the size of the fund. Typically, investment products with high AUMs have higher market trading volumes making them more
liquid
, meaning investors can buy and sell shares of the fund easily.
What Is the Benefit of a Fund With a Large AUM?
Funds with large AUMs have sufficient holdings to meet any redemption pressure. If a few large investors leave the fund, the impact would be minimal.
The Bottom Line
Assets under management (AUM) is the market value of the investments managed by a person or entity on behalf of clients. AUM can reveal the management performance and experience when investors evaluate a company or investment. The SEC regulates firms with large AUMs to protect investors.

Investopedia,"Inventory Turnover Ratio: What It Is, How It Works, and Formula","Close
What Is the Inventory Turnover Ratio?
Inventory turnover ratio is a financial ratio showing how many times a company turned over its
inventory
in a given period. A company can then divide the days in the period, typically a
fiscal year
, by the inventory turnover ratio to calculate how many days it takes, on average, to sell its inventory.
The inventory turnover ratio can help businesses make better decisions on pricing, manufacturing,
marketing
, and
purchasing
. It is one of several common
efficiency ratios
that companies can use to measure how effectively they use their assets.
Key Takeaways
Inventory turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its inventory by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory value during a set period.
Inventory turnover ratios are only useful for comparing similar companies, and are particularly important for retailers.
A relatively low inventory turnover ratio may be a sign of weak sales or excess inventory, while a higher ratio signals strong sales but may also indicate inadequate inventory stocking.
Accounting policies, rapid changes in costs, and seasonal factors may distort inventory turnover comparisons.
Reading The Inventory Turnover
Investopedia / NoNo Flores
Understanding the Inventory Turnover Ratio
As mentioned, the inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a certain period. A higher inventory ratio is usually better, although there may also be downsides to a high turnover.
Analyzing an inventory turnover ratio in conjunction with industry benchmarks and historical trends can provide valuable insights into a company's operational efficiency and competitiveness. On its own, the turnover ratio may not mean much. However, tracking it over time or comparing it against a similar company's ratio can be very useful.

Inventory Turnover Formula and Calculation
The inventory turnover ratio is calculated as follows:
Inventory Turnover
=
COGS
Average Value of Inventory
where:
COGS
=
Cost of goods sold
\begin{aligned} &\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{ \text{COGS} }{ \text{Average Value of Inventory} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{COGS} = \text{Cost of goods sold} \\ \end{aligned}
​
Inventory Turnover
=
Average Value of Inventory
COGS
​
where:
COGS
=
Cost of goods sold
​
Cost of goods sold (COGS)
is also known as cost of sales.
Analysts use COGS instead of sales in the formula for inventory turnover because inventory is typically valued at cost, whereas the sales figure includes the company's
markup
. Some companies may use sales instead of COGS in the calculation, which would tend to inflate the resulting ratio.
Additionally,
average value of inventory
is used to offset
seasonality
effects. It is calculated by adding the value of inventory at the end of a period to the value of inventory at the end of the prior period and dividing the sum by 2.
1
What an Inventory Turnover Ratio Can Tell You
A low inventory turnover ratio might be a sign of weak sales or excessive inventory, also known as overstocking. It could indicate a problem with a retail chain's
merchandising
strategy or inadequate marketing. Simply put, a low inventory turnover ratio means the product is not flying off the shelves, for whatever reason.
A
high inventory turnover ratio
, on the other hand, suggests strong sales. Alternatively, it could be the result of insufficient inventory. As problems go, ensuring that a company has sufficient inventory to support strong sales is a better one to have than needing to scale down inventory because business is lagging.
The speed with which a company can turn over inventory is a critical measure of business performance. Retailers that turn inventory into sales faster tend to outperform comparable competitors.
The
fast fashion
business is an example. Competitors such as H&M and Zara typically limit runs and replace depleted inventory quickly with new items. Slow-selling items equate to higher holding costs. There is also the
opportunity cost
of low inventory turnover; an item that takes a long time to sell delays the stocking of new merchandise that might prove more popular.
A decline in the inventory turnover ratio may signal diminished demand, leading businesses to reduce output.
2
Important
A low inventory turnover ratio can be an advantage during periods of
inflation
or
supply chain
disruptions, if it reflects an inventory increase ahead of supplier price hikes or higher demand. For example, retail inventories fell sharply in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the industry scrambling to meet demand during the ensuing recovery.
3
Inventory Turnover and Dead Stock
Inventory turnover is an especially important piece of data for maximizing efficiency in the sale of perishable and other time-sensitive goods. Examples include groceries, fashion, autos, and periodicals. An overabundance of cashmere sweaters, for instance, may lead to unsold inventory and lost profits, especially as seasons change and retailers restock accordingly. Such unsold stock is known as
obsolete inventory
, or dead stock.
The inventory turnover ratio can be one way of better understanding dead stock. In theory, if a company is not selling a lot of a particular product, the COGS of that good will be very low (since COGS is only recognized upon a sale). Therefore, products with a low turnover ratio should be evaluated periodically to see if the stock is obsolete.
Related Inventory Ratios
The
inventory-to-saIes ratio
is the inverse of the inventory turnover ratio, with the additional distinction that it compares inventories with net sales rather than the cost of sales. A higher inventory-to-sales ratio suggests that the company may be holding excess inventory relative to its sales volume, meaning there may be inefficiencies in its inventory management. A lower inventory-to-sales ratio implies that the company has a leaner inventory position relative to its sales, which may reflect tighter control over inventory levels and/or more efficient allocation of resources.
Another ratio inverse to inventory turnover is
days sales of inventory (DSI)
, which marks the average number of days it takes to turn inventory into sales. DSI is calculated as average value of inventory divided by cost of sales or COGS, and multiplied by 365. Companies tend to want to have a lower DSI, and they usually want that DSI to be sufficient to cover short-term cash needs.
Limitations of Inventory Turnover Ratios
The inventory turnover ratio is a valuable metric for many companies. However, it also has limitations that need to be taken into account:
Industry variability
:
Different industries have varying norms and practices regarding inventory management, so there will be natural differences in their ideal turnover ratios. Comparing turnover ratios across industries without considering these differences can be misleading. For example, publicly
listed
U.S. auto dealers turned over their inventory every 63 days on average in 2022, compared with every 32 days for publicly listed food store chains.
4
Seasonal fluctuations
:
Some businesses experience significant seasonal variations in demand, which can affect their inventory turnover ratios. A high turnover ratio during peak seasons may skew the overall ratio, and companies may look worse even though they've adequately planned for the slower seasons.
Cost variations
:
The cost of goods sold, on which inventory turnover ratio is partly based, can fluctuate due to changes in production costs, raw material prices, or
currency exchange rates
. These fluctuations can distort the accuracy and comparability of turnover ratios over time.
Overlooked carrying costs
:
While a high turnover ratio is generally seen as positive, it may overlook the costs associated with maintaining low inventory levels. For example, a company may incur high fees related to stockouts, rush orders, and lost sales opportunities. Businesses should consider the balance between inventory turnover and the associated carrying costs to optimize profitability.
Ignoring lead times
:
The inventory turnover ratio does not account for
lead times
or the time it takes to replenish inventory. A high turnover ratio may indicate efficient sales, but if lead times are long, it could lead to stockouts and potential customer dissatisfaction if inventory is not replenished quickly enough.
Example of an Inventory Turnover Calculation
For fiscal year 2022, Walmart Inc. (
WMT
) reported cost of sales of $429 billion and year-end inventory of $56.5 billion, up from $44.9 billion a year earlier.
5
Walmart’s inventory turnover ratio for the year was:
2022: $429 billion ÷ [($56.5 billion + $44.9 billion)/2], or about 8.5
Dividing the 365 days in the year by 8.5 shows that Walmart turned over its inventory about every 42 days on average.
Fast-forward to 2024, Walmart reported cost of sales of $490 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2024. It also reported ending inventory of $54.9 billion, up from $56.6 billion a year earlier.
6
So its inventory turnover ratio for 2024 was:
2024: $490 billion ÷ [($54.9 billion + $56.6 billion)/2], or about 8.8
This signals that from 2022 to 2024, Walmart increased its inventory turnover ratio. Dividing the 365 days in the year by 8.8 shows that Walmart turned over its inventory about every 41 days on average.
In instances like this, management should further explore the cause. It may be due to more efficient processes, or it may be due to more demand for the products it offers. However, very generally speaking, the movement of this ratio from 2022 to 2024 in Walmart's case appears to be positive.

Investopedia,"Overhead: What It Means in Business, Major Types, and Examples","Close
Definition
Overhead is an ongoing business expense not directly attributed to creating a product or service.
Companies have numerous expenses. Overhead contains the everyday costs that aren't derived from a specific business activity, product, or service. These costs can be substantial, are often very important or mandatory, and help companies budget and set prices.
Overhead can make or break a business. When it's well managed, revenues and profits are maximized.
Key Takeaways
Overhead is an ongoing business expense not directly tied to product or service creation.
Maximizing revenues and profits requires careful management of overheads.
Overhead costs can be categorized as fixed, variable, or semi-variable, and administrative or
production-related.
The income statement reports overhead expenses.
Examples of overhead include rent, utilities, and administrative expenses.
Overhead
What Is Overhead?
Overhead is the set of
business expenses
that don’t directly contribute to the production of goods or provision of services. They tend to be recurring and constant regardless of whether business is booming or not.
Overhead costs vary by industry. Common examples include the following:
Insurance
Rent
Utilities
Office supplies
Taxes
Depreciation on fixed assets
Advertising expenses
Permits and licenses
Accounting
and legal fees
Importance of Overhead in Business
Overhead costs, alongside
direct costs
, the other main category of business expense, determine a company’s profitability. These expenses are subtracted from revenue in the
income statement
to arrive at net income, the closely watched figure that tells us the amount of money the company gets to keep. The company can use this money for various purposes, such as investing in the business or sharing it with shareholders by declaring dividends.
Unlike direct costs, overhead costs don’t directly influence revenues. However, they are still necessary to run the business and can in cases like advertising, employee perks, and renting prime real estate, indirectly have a significant bearing on sales.
Since overhead costs generally stay constant regardless of a business's revenue, they are often used to calculate
the breakeven point
, where a company sells enough to become profitable. Thus, overhead is essential for setting prices.
Companies need to set prices low enough to attract customers and compete with rivals, but not too low that it becomes impossible to make money. Finding the right balance to maximize revenues and profits requires careful management of overheads.
If overhead is high, the company will need to charge customers more to make a profit, which could lead to a loss of business. If it's low, it can keep prices competitive and still make a reasonable amount of money. However, this isn’t as simple as it sounds. Some overhead can't be cut, and a line needs to be drawn in areas where it can be. If too many costs are slashed, it could jeopardize sales.
Types of Overhead
Overhead costs are typically categorized as fixed, variable, or semi-variable.
Fixed
Fixed costs stay constant irrespective of business activity. Examples include insurance, salaries, accounting services, and rent. If the company has a good or bad month, these costs stay the same.
Variable
Variable costs fluctuate with business activity. Examples include sales commissions, shipping expenses, and maintenance. When business is booming, these expenses tend to grow. When it’s not or when everything shuts down, they decrease.
Semi Variable
Semi-variable costs have a fixed and variable component. They start at a baseline number and increase proportionally based on usage, such as with utilities. Customers don’t just pay for electricity based on consumption. They are also typically charged a fixed amount to be connected to the grid, which must be paid regardless of usage.
Other Types of Overhead
Overhead can also be broken down into other categories. The two primary ones are administration and production, although companies may add extra categories to be more specific. Which ones depend on the nature of their business and the types of costs they commonly incur.
Administrative Overhead
Administrative overhead
is the general day-to-day costs of running a business. Examples include insurance, telephone bills, office supplies, and the wages of staff not directly involved in producing goods or services, such as management, secretaries, janitors, lawyers, IT, and human resources departments.
If a company wishes to break down these costs further, it can create subcategories of administrative overhead. Examples include financial overhead, which is the costs associated with managing a company's finances, such as interest on loans, taxes, and accountant and auditor fees, and selling overhead, which is the costs associated with marketing and selling a company’s goods or services, such as advertising and the salaries and commissions paid to sales employees.
Production Overhead
Production or manufacturing overhead covers indirect expenses incurred while producing the company’s product or service. Examples include rent and property taxes, salaries for supervisors, utilities, depreciation on equipment, repairs, and maintenance.
Examples of Overhead
Overhead costs come in many forms and vary depending on the company’s size and sector. Below we look at some of the more common ones.
Rent
A classic example of overhead is rent. Companies generally have at least one location or office and may also need factories and other facilities to operate. These buildings are usually rented, representing a fixed cost that must be paid every month, quarter, or year.
This expense is often essential and generally doesn’t change depending on business activity. The rent is due even if no income is made.
Companies can reduce rent by shuttering an underperforming part of the business, sharing facilities, downsizing, or moving to a less expensive location. However, this could also have negative implications. For example, relocating an office to the suburbs may impact the company’s ability to retain and attract talented staff. Similarly, a retail store may not want to reduce overheads by moving to a less costly location in the suburbs because this may negatively impact foot traffic and, hence, profits.
Utilities
Utilities include water, gas, electricity, internet, and phone service. Companies need these services to operate.
Some utilities are fixed, while others are semi-variable, meaning a minimum monthly payment is added to an amount based on consumption. The quality of most of these services is pretty standard. However, you can cut these costs by changing suppliers, renegotiating rates, or investing in alternative technologies.
Administrative Costs
Administrative costs are often the most expensive overhead. These expenses support the day-to-day running of the business and are vast. Examples include equipment, such as printers, stationery, and desks, and the salaries of staff not directly involved in producing the company’s revenue.
Administrative costs can be cut by laying off staff or reducing their hours, outsourcing or insourcing certain services, paying less for things like toilet paper and stationery, and no longer offering free coffee.
There is generally a lot of ground to save money with administrative costs. However, certain cutbacks can have the undesirable effect of indirectly reducing the quality of the company’s product or service and scaring customers away.
Strategies for Managing Overhead
Overhead must be carefully managed as they eat into profitability. Companies will keep them as low as possible without jeopardizing quality and sales. The key to successfully running a business is smart spending.
Regularly reviewing and analyzing overhead costs can help maximize efficiency. Managers need to know about costs increasing and understand the implications of cutting expenses as soon as possible.
Potentially non-damaging ways to cut costs include:
Negotiating better rates
: Long-standing relationships with suppliers and service providers can be leveraged to negotiate better terms. Alternatively, if and when possible, it may be worth exploring the competition.
Outsource or insource
: Sometimes, it can make sense to
outsource
essential services such as IT support, payroll processing, accounting, and legal. Other times, putting some or all these specialists on the payroll may make more financial sense.
Streamline operations
: Analysis can identify unnecessary tasks or expenses. Simplifying processes and eliminating unnecessary items could save companies a lot of money without negatively impacting sales.
Remote work
: Another way to cut overhead is letting staff work from home. Workers save from not commuting, and the company can close offices or spend less on utilities and equipment.
Leverage technology
: Technology can be used to automate specific simple tasks. For more complex work, it’s generally better to rely on humans.
The Bottom Line
Overhead is the ongoing cost of running a business that is not directly related to producing a good or service. Examples include rent, insurance, and administrative expenses.
These costs eat into
profitability
but also indirectly impact the top line. Effectively managing overhead enables companies to set competitive prices, maximize sales, and keep a decent chunk of their revenues.

Investopedia,"Guarantor: Definition, Example, and Responsibilities","Close
Definition
A guarantor is an individual or entity who promises to pay a debt if the main party defaults. They act as a backup source of payment if the borrower can’t cover the debt.
What Is a Guarantor?
“Guarantor” is a financial term describing an individual who promises to pay a borrower’s debt if the borrower defaults on their loan obligation. Guarantors
pledge their own assets
as collateral against the loans. On rare occasions, individuals act as their own guarantors, by pledging their own assets against the loan.
The term “guarantor” is often interchanged with the term “surety.”
Key Takeaways
A guarantor guarantees to pay a borrower’s debt if the borrower defaults on a loan obligation.
The guarantor guarantees a loan by pledging their assets as
collateral
.
A guarantor alternatively describes someone who verifies the identity of an individual attempting to land a job or secure a passport.
Unlike a co-signer, a guarantor has no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower.
If the borrower defaults on their loan, then the guarantor is liable for the outstanding obligation, which they must meet; otherwise, legal action may be brought against them.
Understanding a Guarantor
A guarantor is typically over the age of 18 and
resides in the country
where the payment agreement occurs. Guarantors generally exhibit exemplary
credit histories
and sufficient
income
to cover the loan payments if and when the borrower
defaults
, at which time the guarantor’s
assets
may be seized by the lender. And if the borrower chronically makes payments late, the guarantor may be on the hook for additional
interest
owed or penalty costs.
Types of Guarantors
There are many different scenarios in which a guarantor would need to be used. This ranges from assisting people with poor credit histories to simply assisting those without a high-enough income. Guarantors also don’t necessarily need to be liable for the entire monetary obligation in the guarantee. Below are different situations that would require a guarantor, as well as the type of guarantor in a specific guarantee.
Guarantors as Certifiers
In addition to pledging their assets as collateral against loans, guarantors may also help individuals land jobs and secure passport documents. In these situations, guarantors certify that they personally know the applicants and corroborate their identities by confirming photo IDs.
Limited vs. Unlimited
As defined under the terms of the loan agreement, a guarantor can either be limited or unlimited concerning timetables and levels of financial involvement. Case in point: A limited guarantor may be asked to guarantee a
loan
only up to a certain time, after which the borrower alone assumes responsibility for the remaining payments and suffers the consequences of defaulting.
A limited guarantor may also only be responsible for backing a certain percentage of the loan, referred to as a penal sum. This differs from unlimited guarantors, who are liable for the entire amount of the loan throughout the entire duration of the contract.
Other Contexts for Guarantors
Guarantors aren’t solely used by borrowers with poor credit histories. Pointedly, landlords frequently require first-time property renters to provide lease guarantors. This commonly occurs with college students whose parents assume the role of the guarantor, in case the tenant is unable to make the rent or prematurely breaks the
lease
agreement.
Guarantors vs. Co-signers
A guarantor differs from a
co-signer
, who co-owns the asset, and whose name appears on titles. Co-signer arrangements typically occur when the borrower’s qualifying income is less than the figure stipulated in the lender’s requirement. This differs from guarantors, who step in only when borrowers have sufficient income but are thwarted by lousy credit histories. Co-signers share ownership of an asset, while guarantors have no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower.
However, in the event the borrower has a claim against a third party that has caused the default, the guarantor has the right to invoke a process called
subrogation
(“step into the shoes of the borrower”) to recover damages.
For example, in a rental agreement, a co-signer would be responsible for the rent from day one, whereas a guarantor would only be responsible for the rent if the renter fails to make a payment. This also applies to any loan. Guarantors are only notified when the borrower defaults, not for any payment before that.
Important
In the event of a default, the guarantor’s credit history may be adversely affected, which may limit their chances of securing loans in the future.
In essence, a co-signer takes on more financial responsibility than a guarantor does, as
a co-signer is equally responsible
from the onset of the agreement, whereas a guarantor is only responsible once the primary party to the contract fails to meet their obligation.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Guarantors
In an agreement with a guarantor, the advantages usually lie with the primary party in the contract, whereas the disadvantages usually lie with the guarantor. Having a guarantor means that the loan or agreement has a higher and much quicker chance of being approved. Most likely, it can allow for borrowing more and receiving a better
interest rate
. However, loans with guarantors tend to have higher interest rates.
Tip
In a rental agreement, one way to avoid needing a guarantor is by paying a few months of
rent
upfront if you are in a position to do so.
The disadvantages lie with the guarantor. If the person you are guaranteeing fails to pay their obligations, then you are on the hook for the amount. If you are not in a financial situation to make the payments, then you are still liable for the amount, your
credit score
will be negatively impacted, and legal action may be taken against you. Also, if you guarantee a loan, then your ability to borrow additional money for something else is limited because you are tied to an existing obligation.
Pros
Helps a borrower obtain a loan or a rental much easier
Allows for the ability to borrow a higher amount
Can help the borrower improve their credit history
Cons
Guarantor may be liable for the outstanding obligation
Guarantor’s credit score could be negatively impacted
Ability to obtain another loan for separate use is limited
Is a Guarantor a Co-signer?
Though the terms are used interchangeably, they are different. A co-signer takes on equal responsibility in an agreement, co-owns the asset, and is responsible for payments from the start of the agreement. A guarantor is only responsible for payments once the primary party of the agreement defaults and is then notified by the lender. A co-signer has more financial responsibility than a guarantor.
Is a Parent a Guarantor?
A parent can act as a guarantor and often does for a child for their child’s first rental property, as the child’s income is usually not high enough at a young age.
How Do You Qualify As a Guarantor?
Different agreements and different lenders have different requirements for a guarantor. At the minimum, a guarantor will need to have a high credit score without any issues in their
credit report
. They will also have to have an income that is a certain multiple of the monthly or annual payments.
How Much Do You Need to Earn to Be a Guarantor?
There is no specific amount that an individual needs to earn to be a guarantor. The amount relates directly to the loan in question or the rent on a property. For rental agreements,
landlords
usually expect the guarantor to have an annual income that is at least 40 times the monthly rent.
What Happens If a Guarantor Cannot Pay?
If a guarantor cannot pay, both they and the tenant are liable for the obligations. The
lender
will begin collection proceedings against both the guarantor and the tenant, which will adversely impact the credit profile of both.
The Bottom Line
A guarantor is an individual who agrees to pay a borrower’s debt if the borrower defaults on their obligation. A guarantor is not a primary party to the agreement but is considered to be an additional comfort for a lender. A guarantor will have a strong credit score and earn sufficient income to meet the obligation.
Having a guarantor on a loan agreement greatly benefits the borrower. It allows for an agreement to be approved much faster and often at a higher amount.
In the event a borrower defaults, the guarantor must meet the obligation. If they do not, they are still liable and can have a lawsuit brought against them for the outstanding amount. They will also see a negative hit on their credit score.

A fixed-income security is an investment that provides a return through fixed periodic interest payments and the eventual return of principal at maturity.
What Is a Fixed-Income Security?
A fixed-income security is an investment that provides fixed, periodic interest payments and returns the principal amount at maturity. Corporations, municipalities, or the government typically issue fixed-income securities to raise capital for a project or budget item. The main appeal of fixed-income securities is their ability to offer predictable income over time. However, the trade-off is usually lower returns compared to more volatile investments like stocks.
Key Takeaways
Fixed-income securities offer a predictable stream of interest payments and return of principal at maturity.
Common types of fixed income securities include bonds, treasury securities, and certificates of deposits (CDs).
Government backed fixed-income securities are low-risk, low-return investments.
Fixed-income investments are important for portfolio diversification, providing stability.
Risks include inflation, interest rate changes, and credit risk (i.e., the risk of default).
How Fixed Income Security Works
Fixed-income securities work on a simple principle: You lend money by buying a debt instrument from an issuer (corporation, government, municipality) for a set period. In exchange, the issuer agrees to pay periodic interest, usually semiannually, in
coupon payments
and repays the principal when the security
matures
.
Fixed income securities attract conservative investors for their predictability and low volatility.
Additionally, these investments can play a key role in
diversified
portfolios, helping offset the volatility of more high-risk assets.
Types of Fixed-Income Securities
While fixed income securities provide predictable income and a return of
principal
at maturity, they vary significantly based on the issuer, credit rating and risk involved. Here's a breakdown of some common types:

Municipal Bonds
Municipal bonds
are a debt obligation issued by a state or local government to fund infrastructure and public projects such as schools, hospitals, bridges, and highways. Municipal bonds, also known as munis, pay interest income exempt from federal taxes and, for some residents, state and local taxes.
1
Municipal bonds are typically issued in $5,000 increments, making them accessible to many investors. Muni's tax exemption status makes them particularly appealing to investors in high
tax brackets
. However, many retirees and investors can benefit from
diversification and income
provided through bond products.
Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds
are issued by companies to raise funds for business growth, day-to-day operations, or capital expenditures. Bonds bought from companies do not represent ownership in the company, nor do they have voting rights. However, they do offer investors predictable interest payments, usually every six months.
Based on their credit rating, corporate bonds are either
investment-grade
or non-investment-grade. Corporate bonds are classified by their maturity period as short-term, medium-term, or long-term.
2
Treasury Bills
Treasury bills
, or T-bills, are short-term debt obligations from the U.S. Government, ranging in maturity from four to 52 weeks. Because short maturities don't allow much time for interest to accrue or for periodic payments, the
U.S. Treasury
issues T-bills at a discount from par value. Investors then receive the full par value at maturity. T-bills are considered very safe because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
3
Treasury Notes
Treasury notes
, or T-notes, are issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and backed by the U.S. government. They are intermediate-term and mature in two to ten years. Investors purchase T-notes in increments of $100 and pay semiannual interest payments at fixed interest rates. At maturity, the investor receives their full principal repayment.
4
Treasury Bonds
Treasury bonds
, or T-bonds, are the longest-maturing bonds of the government-backed debt obligations. T-bonds, like T-notes, are sold in $100 increments. However, investors purchase T-bonds through
auctions
, and maturities are 20 or 30 years. T-bonds appeal to investors looking for long-term diversification, offering steady income and security. T-bonds interest is exempt from state and local taxes, so they're a powerful
retirement asset
in a diversified portfolio.
5
Certificates of Deposit
Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
, issued by banks and credit unions, are another commonly recognized fixed income security. Because CDs require investors to lock up their money until maturity, they usually offer higher interest rates than savings accounts.
CDs are also considered low-risk, as they're typically insured—by the FDIC for banks and the NCUA for credit unions—up to certain limits.
6
7
Standard CDs start at $500 or $1,000, though some have no minimums.
Jumbo and high-yield CDs
require larger deposits but offer even better rates.
U.S. Savings Bonds
U.S. savings bonds
are another debt obligation issued by the U.S. government. These fixed income securities fund federal spending projects. Like T-bills, bonds are issued at a deep discount, sometimes as much as 50%, and investors receive face value at maturity.
U.S. savings bonds earn interest for up to 30 years. Minimum purchases for savings bonds are $25 and interest is free from state and local taxes.
8
Preferred Stock
Preferred stock
shares certain characteristics with fixed-income securities, such as paying fixed dividends. However, unlike traditional fixed income securities, these dividends are based on a percentage or dollar amount of the stock's par value, assigned at issuance.
Dividends are often higher than those of common stocks but can be suspended if the company faces financial trouble. Preferred stock typically doesn't have a maturity date, which differentiates it from other fixed-income securities.
Fixed Income Credit Ratings
Independent credit agencies such as
Moody's Investor Service
,
Standard & Poor's Global (S&P Global)
, and
Fitch's Ratings
evaluate the creditworthiness of issuers of fixed-income securities. These ratings help investors gauge the risk of default. Fixed income securities may score from AAA to D (for default).
Investment-grade
bonds are rated BBB- (S&P/Fitch) or Baa3 (Moody’s) and above. These are considered lower-risk investments.
Speculative-grade
bonds are rated BB+ (S&P/Fitch) or Ba1 (Moody’s) and below, indicating higher risk and higher potential returns.
Government-backed securities like Treasury bills or bonds are typically assumed to have an
AAA rating
due to the U.S. government's creditworthiness.
Pros and Cons of Fixed Income Security
Advantages
Predictable income paid on a schedule
Lower volatility and market risk
Principal returned at maturity
Diversification benefits
Some have tax-advantages
Disadvantages
Lower returns compared to other securities
Interest rate risk as interest rates may drop as prices rise
Future dollars may not have as much value
Higher returns mean higher default or credit risk
Are Fixed Income Securities Safe?
Fixed-income securities are generally considered safer than stocks, but they're not
risk-free investments
. The safety of fixed-income securities depends on the issuer and credit rating. Government backed fixed income securities, such as T-bills or munis, are the safest, but the trade-off is lower interest rates.
Should I Include Fixed Income in My Portfolio?
Yes, fixed income securities can be an excellent way to diversify your investment portfolio, especially if you're looking for stability and predictable income. The right amount to invest depends on your
risk tolerance
, investment goals, and timeline.
How Do I Decide Between a Bond Fund and Individual Bonds?
Individual bonds and bond funds aim for the same goal: diversification and fixed income. Individual bonds offer fixed income and are less risky in terms of management fees, but they require more capital to achieve diversification. Bond funds, on the other hand, provide liquidity and instant diversification but come with fluctuating returns and management fees.
Do All Fixed Income Securities Have Tax Benefits?
Not all fixed income securities have tax benefits, but some do. Municipal bonds, for example, are exempt from federal income tax and qualified investors may also be exempt from state and local tax.
The Bottom Line
Fixed income securities offer investors predictable income and portfolio diversification. Some fixed income securities also have significant tax benefits, particularly for investors in high tax brackets.
These investments are generally safe, but investors should consult credit ratings and research before committing- especially because of the illiquidity of fixed income securities. If you're considering adding fixed income secur",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp
Investopedia,"Shelf Offering: What It Is, How It Works, Advantages, and Example","Close
Definition
A shelf offering allows a public company to register securities with the SEC and sell them for up to three years.
What Is a Shelf Offering?
A shelf offering is a
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
provision that allows an equity
issuer
to register a new issue of
securities
without having to sell the entire issue at once. The issuer can instead sell portions of the issue over three years without re-registering the security or incurring penalties. This gives the issuer the time to take advantage of favorable market timing in the future.
Key Takeaways
A shelf offering allows a company to register a new issue with the SEC and sell the security over three years instead of all at once.
This lets a company adjust the timing of the sales of a new issue to take advantage of more favorable market conditions should they arise in the future.
The company saves any unissued shares, and they remain “on the shelf” until offered for public sale.
How Shelf Offerings Work
A shelf offering can be used for different purposes, including the sale of new securities by the issuer (primary offerings), resales of outstanding securities (secondary offerings), or a combination of both. Companies that issue a new security can register a shelf offering up to three years in advance, which effectively gives it that long to sell the
shares
in the issue.
1
Depending on the type of security and the nature of the issuer, the issuer must file forms
S-3
,
F-3
, or
F-6
to make the shelf offering. During this period, the issuer must file quarterly, annual, and other disclosures with the SEC, even if it hasn’t issued any securities under the offering. If the three-year window draws close to expiring and the company hasn’t sold all of the securities in the shelf offering, it can file replacement registration statements to extend it.
2
A shelf offering enables an issuer to access markets quickly, with little additional administrative paperwork, when market conditions are optimal for the issuer. The primary advantages of a shelf registration statement are timing and certainty. When a firm finally acts on a shelf offering and issues actual securities to the market, it’s called a
takedown
.
Takedowns can be made without review by the SEC’s
Division of Corporation Finance
and without delay. Suppose the housing market is declining dramatically. In this case, it may not be a good time for a home builder to come out with its second offering, as many
investors
will be pessimistic about companies in that sector. By using a shelf offering, the firm can fulfill all registration-related procedures beforehand and act quickly when conditions become more favorable.
Fast Fact
A shelf offering is also called a shelf registration.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Shelf Offerings
Advantages
A shelf offering provides the issuer with tight control over the process of offering new shares. It allows the company to influence the shares’ price by managing the supply of its security in the market. It also enables the company to save on the cost of registration with the SEC by not having to re-register each time it wants to release new shares.
The process of shelf registration allows the company to address multiple issues of a particular security within a single registration statement. This can be simpler to create and manage, since multiple filings are not required, lowering administrative costs for the business as a whole.
No maintenance requirements exist beyond standard reporting, so shelf registrations do not create an additional burden while they are waiting for the issue.
Disadvantages
Shelf offerings may be perceived negatively by investors. It may be considered a sign that the company needs capital and may not have a clear plan going forward. This may, in turn, lead to a drop in the company's stock price.
Companies that decide to use shelf offerings are required to comply with SEC reporting requirements. The regulator requires companies to file disclosure documents regularly, which can be cumbersome—especially if the company is fairly new.
Shelf offerings can lead to share
dilution
. That's because each new share offering can reduce the percentage of ownership of the existing shareholders and, therefore, the value of their holdings. This also reduces the company's
earnings per share (EPS)
, which can affect share prices.
Pros
Issuing company has control over offering process
Issuer has influence over share price by managing supply
Company can address multiple issues under same registration statement
Cost-effective because company doesn't have to re-register each new release
Only standard reporting is required
Cons
Could be perceived negatively
May lead to a drop in the company's stock price
Reporting requirements may be cumbersome
Share dilution for existing shareholder
Example of a Shelf Offering
SafeStitch Medical, a manufacturer of robotic surgical technology, used a shelf offering to prepare new offerings to correspond with plans to launch a new product.
3
When a new product line launched with success, more shares were released for sale to the public. Even though the risk of
share dilution
was present, the market responded to the favorable news regarding the pending technological advancement.
Why Would a Company Do a Shelf Offering?
A shelf offering allows a company to register a security and then keep it on the shelf for up to three years. This way, the company can register its securities upfront and wait until conditions are favorable to sell them on the market. Shelf offerings give companies a method to plan their offerings over the long term and to control the supply of their securities on the market.
Does a Shelf Offering Dilute Shares?
Whenever a company sells new shares, this reduces the value of existing shares. With a shelf offering, the
equity
position of existing shareholders eventually decreases through share dilution. However, the actual dilution does not occur until the company makes its takedown, bringing the shares off the shelf and selling them to investors. Although dilution may be an inevitable consequence of issuing additional shares, shelf offerings allow a company more control over the timing of this impact, and they can provide the markets with some insight into a company’s upcoming issuance plans.
What Is a Shelf Registration?
A shelf registration under SEC Rule 415 allows a company to register a security, but instead of selling it immediately, the company can offer its securities to the market over as much as three years.
1
The company registers its securities under a core prospectus that applies for the duration of the shelf offering, and it provides prospectus supplements when it sells the securities to the market.
4
The Bottom Line
A shelf offering allows a company to register its securities with the SEC but delay putting them on the market for up to three years. This provides some advantages, as the company can time the release of its securities, ideally aligning the issuance with favorable market conditions. Shelf offerings can also help companies save on the registration process, as they do not have to re-register each time that they release new shares.

What Is a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loan?
A Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan is a home mortgage that is insured by the government and issued by a bank or other lender approved by the agency. FHA loans require a lower minimum down payment than many
conventional loans
, and applicants may have
lower credit scores
than the
best mortgage lenders
usually require.
FHA loans are designed to help
low- to moderate-income families attain homeownership, and they are particularly popular with first-time homebuyers.
Key Takeaways
FHA loans are mortgages intended for
certain borrowers
who might find it difficult to obtain loans otherwise.
The federal government insures FHA loans issued by private lenders, such as banks.
FHA borrowers must pay two types of mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs)—one upfront and the other monthly.
Due to FHA insurance, banks are more willing to lend to homebuyers with low credit scores and small down payments.
First-time homebuyers may find that an FHA loan is their most affordable mortgage option.
Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou.
How an FHA Loan Works
FHA loan criteria allow for borrowers with a lower-than-average credit score of at least 580 to qualify for an FHA-insured mortgage. Your credit score represents a numerical summary of your creditworthiness based on your credit history, such as how well you repay your debts.
FHA loan criteria also allow borrowers to put down a smaller down payment at the loan's closing. The FHA mandates that the
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio
cannot exceed 96.5% of the value of a home with an FHA loan. In other words, you can have a down payment as low as 3.5% of the purchase price, meaning you can qualify for FHA financing of up to 95.5% of the property's value.
1
2
However, if your credit score falls between 500 and 579, you can still get FHA financing, but you will need to make a down payment of at least 10%, meaning you can only finance up to 90% of the property's value.
1
With FHA loans, the down payment can come from savings, a financial gift from a family member, or a
grant
for down payment assistance.
The Bank's Role in an FHA Loan
The FHA doesn't actually lend anyone money to buy a home. Instead, FHA-approved lenders via banks or other financial institutions issue the mortgage loans.
The role of the FHA involves guaranteeing or insuring the loan, making it easier for borrowers to get approved since the lender does not bear the default risk.
2
Borrowers who qualify for an FHA loan are required to purchase
mortgage insurance
, with the
premium
payments going to the FHA.
3
History of the FHA Loan
Congress created the FHA in 1934 during the
Great Depression
. At that time, the housing industry was in trouble: Default and foreclosure rates had skyrocketed, 50% down payments were commonly required, and the mortgage terms were impossible for ordinary wage earners to meet. As a result, the U.S. was primarily a nation of renters, and only one in 10 households owned their homes.
4
After the government created the FHA to reduce the risk to lenders and make it easier for borrowers to qualify for home loans, the homeownership rate in the U.S. steadily climbed, reaching an all-time high of 69.2% in 2004, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. By the end of 2024, the rate stood at 65.7%.
5
Important
Though principally designed for lower-income borrowers, FHA loans are available to everyone, including those who can afford conventional mortgages. In general, borrowers with good credit and strong financials will be better off with a conventional mortgage, while those with poorer credit and more debt, as well as would-be homebuyers who simply don't have the cash for a larger down payment, can benefit from an FHA loan.
Other Types of FHA Loans
In addition to traditional mortgages, the FHA offers several other
home loan types
.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)
This is a
reverse mortgage
program that helps homeowners age 62 and older convert the equity in their homes to cash while retaining the home's title. The homeowner can take the funds as a lump sum, in a fixed monthly amount, in a
line of credit
, or some combination.
6
FHA 203(k) Improvement Loan
This loan factors the cost of certain repairs and renovations into the amount borrowed.
7
It's helpful for those willing to buy a fixer-upper and put some sweat equity into their home.
FHA Energy Efficient Mortgage
This program is similar to the FHA 203(k)
improvement loan
program, but it's focused on upgrades that can lower your utility bills, such as new insulation or solar or wind energy systems.
8
Section 245(a) Loan
This program works for borrowers who expect their incomes to increase. The Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM) starts with lower monthly payments that increase over time. The Growing Equity Mortgage (GEM) has scheduled increases in monthly
principal
payments. Both promise shorter loan terms.

5 Types of FHA Loan
FHA LOAN TYPE
WHAT IT IS
Traditional Mortgage
A mortgage that finances a primary residence.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage
A reverse mortgage that allows homeowners age 62 and up to exchange home equity for cash.
203(k) Mortgage Program
A mortgage that includes extra funds to cover the cost of repairs, renovations, and home improvements.
Energy Efficient Mortgage Program
A mortgage that includes extra funds to pay for energy-efficient home improvements.
Section 245(a) Loans
A Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM) has a low initial monthly payment that increases over time. A Growing Equity Mortgage (GEM) has scheduled increases in monthly principal payments to shorten the loan term and build equity faster.

What Are FHA Loan Requirements?
Your
mortgage lender
will evaluate your qualifications for an FHA loan as it would with any mortgage applicant, starting with a check to see that you have a valid Social Security number, reside lawfully in the U.S., and are of legal age (according to your state's laws).
FHA loan criteria are less rigid in some ways than a bank's usual loan criteria. However, there are also some more stringent requirements.
Whether or not it's an FHA-guaranteed loan, a lender will examine your financial history when you apply for a mortgage.
Credit Scores and Down Payments
FHA loans are available to individuals with credit scores as low as 500, which represents the ""poor"" range for a
FICO score
.
11
If your credit score is between 500 and 579, you may be able to secure an FHA loan, assuming you can afford a down payment of at least 10%. If your credit score is 580 or higher, you can get an FHA loan with a down payment of as little as 3.5%.
1
2
By comparison, applicants typically need a credit score of at least 620 in order to qualify for a conventional mortgage.
12
The down payment required by most banks varies between 3% and 20%, depending on how eager they are to lend money at the time you apply.
Tip
As a general rule, the lower your credit score and down payment, the higher the
interest rate
you'll pay on your mortgage.
History of Honoring Debts
A
lender
will look at your work history as well as your last two years of payment history on your credit report.
13
People who fall behind on
federal student loan
payments or income tax payments may be required to agree to a satisfactory repayment plan for those debts. A history of bankruptcy or foreclosure may prove problematic as well.
14
Typically, to qualify for an FHA loan—or any type of mortgage—at least two years must have passed since the borrower experienced
bankruptcy
or
foreclosure
, and they must have established good credit and have their financial affairs in order since then. However, borrowers can qualify for exceptions if they have experienced extenuating circumstances, such as serious illness.
15
Proof of Steady Employment
The FHA-approved lender will want assurances that the applicant can repay the mortgage loan. As a result, lenders will ask for evidence of recent and steady employment, documented by tax returns and pay stubs.
If you've been self-employed for less than two years but more than one year, you may still qualify if you have a solid work and income history in the same or a related occupation for the two years before becoming self-employed.
13
Sufficient Income
Your mortgage payments,
property taxes
, mortgage insurance and
homeowners insurance
premiums, and any
homeowner association fees
must generally total less than 31% of your

Investopedia,What Is a 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan?,"Close
Definition
A 403(b) plan, also known as a Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA) plan, is a retirement savings account offered to employees of schools, the public sector, and non-profits.
What Is a 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan?
A 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plan (TSA) is a retirement savings plan for employees of public schools, government agencies, and certain other tax-exempt non-profit organizations.
Employees who are eligible to use a 403(b) include teachers, school administrators, professors, government employees, nurses, doctors, and librarians.
Key Takeaways
The 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan (TSA) was designed for employees of tax-exempt organizations.
As with a 401(k), contributions to a 403(b) are made through payroll deductions and come with tax benefits for the saver.
Investment choices can be more limited in a 403(b) and some accounts offer less protection from creditors than 401(k)s.
403(b) Contributions
The 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan operates like a
401(k)
plan, allowing participants to save money for retirement through
payroll deductions
while enjoying certain tax benefits. Similarities include:
Contributions through payroll deductions
Annual contribution limits set by the
Internal Revenue Service
(IRS)
An option for the employer to match part of the employee's contribution
Participants must reach 59½ before withdrawing funds or face an
early withdrawal
penalty

Public school employees of Indian tribal governments
Ministers, members of the clergy, and church employees
Employees of other tax-exempt organizations
2
Important
If an employer offers a 403(b) and a 401(k), individuals can contribute to both, but their combined contribution cannot exceed the annual IRS limit of $23,500 in 2025 (up from $23,000 in 2024.) People aged 50 and over can contribute an additional $7,500 as a
catch-up contribution
, although some 403(b) plans base eligibility for the catch-up on length of service rather than age.
3
4
Types of 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans
Like the 401(k), the 403(b) plan can give the employee a choice of a traditional plan or a Roth plan. Not all employers offer a Roth option.
With a traditional 403(b) plan, the employee has pretax money automatically deducted from each paycheck and paid into a personal retirement account. Thus, the employee's income and the taxes owed on it are reduced for the year. The taxes will be due only when the employee makes a withdrawal.
2
With a Roth 403(b) plan,
after-tax money
is paid into the retirement account. There's no immediate tax advantage. But, the employee will not owe any more taxes on that money or the profit it accrues when it is withdrawn.
5
Fast Fact
Clergy can participate in a 403(b) but another plan, the 403(b)(9), is designed specifically for employees of religious institutions.
Advantages of 403(b) Plans
The big advantages of a 403(b) are the same as those for a 401(k): The money contributed and the earnings that accrue in a traditional account are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn. Both the contributions and the earnings in a Roth 403(b) are free from further taxes.
2
Many 403(b) plans vest funds over a shorter period than 401(k)s, and some even allow immediate
vesting
of funds, which is rare for 401(k)s.
An employee with 15 or more years of service with certain nonprofits or government agencies may be able to make additional catch-up contributions to a 403(b) plan. The usual eligibility for the catchup starts at age 50.
6
Fast Fact
According to a 2024 survey by AARP of age 50-plus adults who are regularly saving for retirement, just 33% expect to accumulate enough money in retirement to be financially secure if they continue saving at their current rate.
7
Disadvantages of 403(b) Plans
People who withdraw money from a 403(b) plan before age 59½ owe income taxes on the money in the year it is withdrawn, plus a 10% tax penalty. (The same rule applies to a 401(k) plan.)
The penalty can be avoided under certain circumstances, such as separating from an employer at age 55 or older, needing to pay a qualified medical expense, or becoming disabled. The taxes owed cannot be avoided.
1
When the 403(b) was invented in 1958, it was known as a

True to its history, the modern 403(b) offers the

Otherwise, a 403(b) tends to offer a more limited choice of mutual fund investments than its cousins in private business. plans. Many other investments, such as Individual stocks and
real estate investment trusts
(REITs), are prohibited.

Pros
Earnings and returns in regular 403(b) plans are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn
Many plans vest in short periods or even immediately
Generous eligibility for catch-up contributions based on length of service
Cons
Early withdrawals are subject to a 10% tax penalty
Narrower investment choices than similar plans
Accounts may lack full protection from creditors
What Are the Similarities Between 401(k) and 403(b)?
The 401(k) and the 403(b) are both long-term retirement savings plans offered through employers. Both are
tax-advantaged
ways for employees to save for retirement.
The 403(b) tends to offer a smaller choice of investments. At least one of those choices will be an annuity plan.
10
2
Some employers in the non-profit sector offer their employees both a 401(k) and a 403(b).
When Is Money in a 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan Taxed?
The deferred salary is not subject to federal or state income tax until the money is distributed. A 403(b) plan may offer a Roth account as an option. In that case, contributions are taxed immediately but the entire balance is tax-free when it is withdrawn.
11
What Types of Employers Can Establish a 403(b) Plan?
Public educational institutions and 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations are the only types of employers that may establish a 403(b) plan.
11
The Bottom Line
The 403(b) is offered by public schools and other tax-exempt organizations to many of their employees. It works just like a 401(k) plan offered by a company and may include contributions by employers. The IRS establishes limits to annual contributions to 403(b) plans, 401(k) plans, and IRAs.

What Is the Head and Shoulders Pattern?
A head and shoulders pattern is used in
technical analysis
. It is a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. The pattern appears as a baseline with three peaks, where the outside two are close in height, and the middle is highest.
The head and shoulders pattern forms when a stock's price rises to a peak and then declines back to the base of the prior up-move. Then, the price rises above the previous peak to form the ""head"" and then declines back to the original base. Finally, the stock price peaks again at about the level of the first peak of the formation before falling back down.
1
The head and shoulders pattern is considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns. It is one of several top patterns that signal, with varying degrees of accuracy, that an upward trend is nearing its end.
Key Takeaways
A head and shoulders pattern is a technical indicator with a chart pattern of three peaks, where the outer two are close in height, and the middle is the highest.
A head and shoulders pattern—considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns—is a chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal.
An inverse head and shoulders pattern predicts a bearish-to-bullish trend.
The neckline rests at the support or resistance lines, depending on the pattern direction.
Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou
Understanding the Head and Shoulders Pattern
A head and shoulders pattern has four components:
After long bullish trends, the price rises to a peak and subsequently declines to form a trough.
The price rises again to form a second high substantially above the initial peak and declines again.
The price rises a third time, but only to the first peak level, before declining again.
The neckline, drawn at the two troughs or peaks (inverse).

The first and third peaks are the shoulders, and the second peak forms the head. The line connecting the first and second troughs is called the
neckline

Inverse Head and Shoulders
The opposite of a head and shoulders chart is the
inverse head and shoulders
, also called a head and shoulders bottom. It is inverted with the head and shoulders bottoms used to predict reversals in downtrends. This pattern is identified when the
price action
of a security meets the following characteristics:
The price falls to a
trough
, then rises
The price falls below the former trough, then rises again
The price falls again but not as far as the second trough
Once the final trough is made, the price heads upward toward the resistance (the neckline) found near the top of the previous troughs.
Fast Fact
An inverse head and shoulders pattern is also a reliable indicator, signaling that a downward trend is about to reverse into an upward trend.
1
In this case, the stock's price reaches three consecutive lows, separated by temporary rallies.
Of these, the second trough is the lowest (the head), and the first and third are slightly shallower (the shoulders). The final rally after the third dip signals that the bearish trend has reversed, and prices are likely to keep rallying upward.
What Does the Head and Shoulders Pattern Tell You?
The head and shoulders pattern
indicates
that a reversal is possible.
1
Traders believe that three sets of peaks and troughs, with a larger peak in the middle, means a stock's price will begin falling. The neckline represents the point at which bearish traders start selling.
The pattern also indicates that the new downward trend will likely continue until the right shoulder is broken—where prices move higher than the prices at the right peak.
Advantages and Disadvantages of the Head and Shoulders Pattern
Advantages
Experienced traders identify it easily
Defined profit and risk
Big market movements can be profited from
Can be used in all markets
Disadvantages
Novice traders may miss it
Large stop loss distances possible
Unfavorable risk-to-reward possible
Advantages Explained
Experienced traders identify it easily
: The pattern is very recognizable to an experienced trader.
Defined profit and risk
: Short and long entry levels and stop distance can be clearly defined with confirmation openings and closings.
Big market movements can be profited from
: The timeframe for a head and shoulders pattern is fairly long, so a market can move significantly from entry to close price.
Can be used in all markets
: The pattern can be used in forex and stock trading.
Important
While traders agree that the pattern is a reliable indicator, there is no guarantee that the trend will reverse as indicated.
Disadvantages Explained
Novice traders might miss it
: The head and shoulders pattern may not present with a flat neckline; it may be skewed, which can throw off new traders.
Large stop loss distances possible
: Large downward movement over long timeframes can result in a large stop distance.
Neckline can appear to move
: If the price pulls back, the neckline might be retested, confusing some traders.
What Does a Head and Shoulders Pattern Tell You?
The head and shoulders chart is said to depict a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal and signals that an upward trend is nearing its end. Investors consider it to be one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns.
How Reliable Is a Head and Shoulders Pattern?
The most common entry point is a breakout of the neckline, with a stop above (market top) or below (market bottom) the right shoulder. The profit target is the difference between the high and low with the pattern added (market bottom) or subtracted (market top) from the breakout price. The system is not perfect, but it does provide a method of trading the markets based on logical price movements.
Can Head and Shoulders Turn Bullish?
An inverse head and shoulders, also called a ""head and shoulders bottom,"" is similar to the standard head and shoulders pattern but inverted, with the head and shoulders top used to predict reversals in downtrends. It is a bearish-to-bullish indicator.
What Is the Opposite of a Head and Shoulders Pattern?
The inverse head and shoulders pattern is the opposite of the head and shoulders, indicating a reversal from a bearish trend to a bullish trend.
The Bottom Line
The head and shoulders is a pattern used by traders to identify price reversals. A bearish head and shouders has three peaks, with the middle one reaching higher than the other two. It indicates a reversal of an upward trend.
A bullish head and shoulders has three troughs, with the middle one reaching lower than the other two. It indicates a reversal of a downward trend.

What Is Term Life Insurance?
Term life insurance provides a death benefit for a specified period of time that pays the policyholder's beneficiaries. Once the term expires, the policyholder can either renew it for another term, possibly convert it to permanent coverage, or allow the term
life insurance policy
to lapse.
Key Takeaways
Term life insurance guarantees payment of a stated death benefit to the insured's beneficiaries if the insured person dies during the specified term.
These policies have no value other than the guaranteed death benefit and don’t feature a savings component (as is found in permanent life insurance products).
Term life premiums are based on a person’s age, health, and life expectancy.
Depending on the insurance company, it may be possible to turn term life into whole life insurance.
You can purchase term life policies that last 10, 15, 20 years, or more and you can usually renew them for an additional term.
The
best term life insurance companies
have low prices, easy application processes, flexible policy features, and good customer service.
Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnihgt
How Term Life Insurance Works
When you buy a term life insurance policy, the insurance company determines the premium based on the policy's value (the payout amount) and factors such as
age, gender, and health
. Other considerations affecting rates include the company’s business expenses, how much it earns from its investments, and mortality rates for each age.
1
In some cases, a medical exam may be required. The insurance company may also inquire about your driving record, current medications, smoking status, occupation, hobbies, family history, and similar information.
If you die during the policy term, the insurer will pay the policy's face value to your beneficiaries. This cash benefit—which is not typically taxable—may be used by beneficiaries to settle your healthcare and funeral costs, consumer debt, mortgage debt, and other expenses.
2
However, beneficiaries are not required to use the insurance proceeds to settle the deceased's debts.
There is no payout if the policy expires before your death or you live beyond the policy term. You may be able to renew a term policy at expiration, but the premiums will be recalculated based on your age at the time of renewal.
Cost of Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance is usually the
least costly life insurance
available because it offers a death benefit for a restricted time and doesn’t have a
cash value
component like permanent insurance. For example, data from Quotacy shows that a healthy, non-smoking man aged 30 could get a 30-year term life insurance policy with a $250,000 death benefit for an average of $18 per month as of October 2024.
At age 50
, the premium would rise to $67 a month.

In contrast, here’s a look at rates for a $100,000
whole life policy
(which is a type of
permanent policy
, meaning it lasts your lifetime and includes cash value). As you can see, the same 30-year-old healthy male would pay an average of $100 a month and at 50, he’d pay $227. Although this policy pays out significantly less than the term policy in the previous example, it costs more since it lasts the policyholder's whole life.

Most term life insurance policies expire without paying a death benefit, lowering the insurer's overall risk compared to a permanent life policy. The reduced risk is one factor that allows insurers to charge lower premiums.
Interest rates, the financials of the insurance company, and state regulations can also affect premiums. In general, companies often offer better rates at the ""breakpoint"" coverage levels of $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, and $1,000,000.
Tip
When you consider the amount of coverage you can get for your premium dollars, term life insurance tends to be the least expensive life insurance. Check our recommendations for the
best term life insurance policies
when you are ready to buy.
Example of Term Life Insurance
Thirty-year-old George wants to protect his family in the unlikely event of his early death. He buys a 10-year, $500,000 term life insurance policy with a premium of $50 per month.
If George dies within the 10-year term, the policy will pay George’s beneficiary $500,000. If he dies after the policy has expired, his beneficiary will receive no benefit. If he remains alive and renews the policy after 10 years, the premiums will be higher than his initial policy because they will be based on his current age of 40 rather than 30.
If George is diagnosed with a terminal illness during the first policy term, he probably will not be eligible to renew the policy when it expires. Some policies offer guaranteed re-insurability (without proof of insurability), but such features come at a higher cost.
Types of Term Life Insurance
There are several types of term life insurance. The best option will depend on your individual circumstances. Generally, most companies offer terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, although a few offer 35- and 40-year terms.
Level Term or Level-Premium Policy
Level-premium insurance
has a fixed monthly payment for the life of the policy. Most term life insurance has a level premium, and it’s the type we’ve been referring to in most of this article. As we mentioned before, this type of policy generally provides coverage for a period ranging from 10 to 30 years. The death benefit is also fixed.
Because actuaries must account for the increasing costs of insurance over the life of the policy's effectiveness, the level premium is comparatively higher than yearly renewable term life insurance.
Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) Policy
Yearly renewable term (YRT) policies
are one-year policies that can be renewed each year without providing evidence of insurability.
The premiums rise from year to year as the insured person ages. Thus, they can become prohibitively expensive as the policyholder ages. However, they may be a good option for someone who needs temporary insurance.
Decreasing Term Policy
These policies have a death benefit that declines each year according to a predetermined schedule. The policyholder pays a fixed level premium for the duration of the policy.
Decreasing term policies are often used in conjunction with a mortgage, with the policyholder matching the insurance payout to the declining principal of the home loan.
Benefits of Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance is attractive to young people with children. Parents can obtain substantial coverage for a low cost, and if the insured dies while the policy is in effect, the family can rely on the death benefit to replace lost income.
These policies are also well-suited for people with growing families. They can maintain the coverage needed until, for example, their children reach adulthood and become self-sufficient.
The term life benefit may be equally useful to an older surviving spouse. However, premiums for people who wait until they are older to apply for insurance will pay higher premiums than if they’d gotten a level-term policy when they were younger.
Each insurance company sets a maximum age for its term life insurance coverage, which usually ranges from about 80 to 90 years old.
Term Life Insurance vs. Permanent Life Insurance
The main differences between a term life insurance policy and a permanent insurance policy (such as whole life or universal life insurance) are the duration of the policy, the accumulation of cash value, and the cost. The right choice for you will depend on your needs. Here are some things to consider.
Cost of Premiums
Term life policies are ideal for people who want substantial coverage at a low cost.
People who own whole life insurance pay more in premiums for less coverage but have the security of knowing they are protected for life.
People who buy term life pay premiums for an extended period, but they get nothing in return unless they have the misfortune to die before the term expires. Plus, term life insurance premiums increase with age.
Availability of Coverage
Unless a term policy is a
guaranteed renewable
, the company could refuse to renew coverage at the end of a po",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp
Investopedia,Internal Rate of Return: An Inside Look,"Close
The internal rate of return (IRR) is frequently used by companies to analyze profit centers and decide between capital projects. But this budgeting metric can also help you evaluate certain financial events in your own life, like mortgages and investments.
The
IRR
is the interest rate (also known as the
discount rate
) that will bring a series of cash flows (positive and negative) to a
net present value (NPV)
of zero (or to the current value of cash invested). Using IRR to obtain net
present value
is known as the
discounted cash flow method
of financial analysis.
Key Takeaways
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the interest rate that will bring the net present value of a series of cash flows to zero.
Corporations use IRR to estimate the present value of future cash flows from a potential investment.
IRR calculations can be very complex, but can easily be calculated using accounting software or spreadsheet programs like Excel.
Uses of Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
As we mentioned above, IRR is a key tool in corporate finance. For example, a corporation will evaluate investing in a new plant versus extending an existing plant based on the IRR of each project. In such a case, each new
capital project
must produce an IRR that is higher than the company's
cost of capital
. Once this hurdle is surpassed, the project with the highest IRR would be the wiser investment, all other things being equal (including risk).
IRR is also useful for corporations in evaluating stock
buyback
programs. Clearly, if a company allocates a substantial amount to a repurchasing its shares, the analysis must show that the company's own stock is a better investment—that is, has a higher IRR—than any other use of the funds, such as creating new outlets or acquiring other companies.
Calculation of Internal Rate of Return
The IRR
formula can be very complex
depending on the timing and variances in
cash flow
amounts. Without a computer or financial calculator, IRR can only be computed by trial and error. The
Excel IRR function
can help you accomplish this task much easier.
One of the disadvantages of using IRR is that all cash flows are assumed to be reinvested at the same discount rate, although in the real world, these rates will fluctuate, particularly with longer-term projects. IRR can be useful, however, when comparing projects of equal risk, rather than as a fixed return projection.

Warning
IRR calculations do not account for the riskiness of a proposed investment.
Example of Internal Rate of Return Calculation
The simplest example of computing an IRR is by taking one from everyday life: a
mortgage
with even payments. Assume an initial mortgage amount of $200,000 and monthly payments of $1,050 for 30 years. The IRR (or implied interest rate) on this loan annually is 4.8%.
Because the stream of payments is equal and spaced at even intervals, an alternative approach is to discount these payments at a 4.8% interest rate, which will produce a net present value of $200,000. Alternatively, if the payments are raised to, say $1,100, the IRR of that loan will rise to 5.2%.
Here's how the above formula for IRR works using this example:
The initial payment (CF
1
) is $200,000 (a positive inflow)
Subsequent cash flows (CF
2
, CF
3
, CF
n
) are negative $1,050 (negative because it is being paid out)
Number of payments (N) is 30 years x 12 = 360 monthly payments
Initial Investment is $200,000
IRR is 4.8% divided by 12 (to equate to monthly payments) = 0.400%
Internal Rate of Return and the Power of Compounding
IRR is also useful in demonstrating the power of
compounding
. For example, if you invest $50 every month in the stock market over a 10-year period, that money would turn into $7,764 at the end of the 10 years with a 5% IRR, which is more than the current 10-year Treasury (
risk-free
) rate.
In other words, to get a
future value
of $7,764 with monthly payments of $50 per month for 10 years, the IRR that will bring that flow of payments to a
net present value of zero
is 5%.
Compare this investment strategy to investing a lump-sum amount: to get the same future value of $7,764 with an IRR of 5%, you would have to invest $4,714 today, in contrast to the $6,000 invested in the $50-per-month plan. So, one way of comparing lump-sum investments versus payments over time is to use the IRR.
Internal Rate of Return and Investment Returns
IRR analysis can be useful in dozens of ways. For example, when the lottery amounts are announced, did you know that a $100 million pot is not actually $100 million? It is a series of payments that will eventually lead to a
payout
of $100 million but does not equate to a net present value of $100 million.
In some cases, advertised payouts or prizes are simply a total of $100 million over a number of years, with no assumed discount rate. In almost all cases where a prize winner is given an option of a
lump-sum payment
versus payments over a long period of time, the lump-sum payment will be the better alternative.
Another common use of IRR is in the computation of portfolio, mutual fund or individual stock returns. In most cases, the advertised return will include the assumption that any
cash dividends
are reinvested in the portfolio or stock. Therefore, it is important to scrutinize the assumptions when comparing returns of various investments.
What if you don't want to reinvest
dividends
, but need them as income when paid? And if dividends are not assumed to be reinvested, are they paid out or are they left in cash? What is the assumed return on the cash? IRR and other assumptions are particularly important on instruments like
whole life insurance policies
and
annuities
, where the cash flows can become complex. Recognizing the differences in the assumptions is the only way to compare products accurately.
What Are the Problems With Internal Rate of Return?
The internal rate of return can sometimes give a distorted view of capital returns, especially when viewed without considering the context of each investment. One major assumption is that any interim cash flows from a project can be invested at the same IRR as the original project, which may not necessarily be the case. In addition, IRR does not account for risk—in many cases, investors may prefer a project with a slightly lower IRR to one with high returns and high risk.
1
What Is a Good Internal Rate of Return?
There's no fixed rule for what makes a ""good"" internal rate of return, except that a company's IRR for a project should exceed its cost of capital. Typical returns from a capital investment will vary depending on the industry and the type of investment. Using the real estate industry as a very general example, an IRR of 10% would be acceptable for very conservative projects, while risky ones might require an IRR greater than 20%.
2
What Does Internal Rate of Return Tell You?
The internal rate of return tells you how much a project or investment needs to make in order to break even, accounting for the cost of capital and the net present value of future cash flows. In other words, it is the interest rate that makes the present value of the expected income streams equal to the cost of the investment.
The Bottom Line
As the number of trading methodologies,
alternative investment
plans, and financial asset classes has increased exponentially over the last few years, it is important to be aware of IRR and how the assumed discount rate can alter results, sometimes dramatically.
Many
accounting software
programs now include an IRR calculator, as do
Excel
and other programs. A handy alternative for some is the good old HP 12c financial calculator, which will fit in a pocket or briefcase.

What Is Marketing?
Marketing refers to the activities a company undertakes to
promote
the buying or selling of its products or services. Marketing includes advertising and allows businesses to sell products and services to consumers, other businesses, and organizations.
Professionals who work in a corporation's marketing and promotion departments seek to get the attention of key potential audiences through advertising. Promotions are targeted to certain audiences and may involve celebrity
endorsements
, catchy phrases or slogans, memorable packaging or graphic designs, and overall media exposure.
Key Takeaways
Marketing refers to all activities a company does to promote and sell products or services to consumers.
Marketing makes use of the ""marketing mix,"" also known as the four Ps—product, price, place, and promotion.
Marketing used to be centered around traditional marketing techniques including television, radio, mail, and word-of-mouth strategies.
Though traditional marketing is still prevalent, digital marketing now allows companies to engage in newsletter, social media, affiliate, and content marketing strategies.
At its core, marketing seeks to take a product or service, identify its ideal customers, and draw the customers' attention to the product or service available.
Understanding Marketing
Marketing as a discipline involves all the actions a company undertakes to
draw in customers
and maintain relationships with them. Networking with potential or past clients is part of the work too and may include writing thank you emails, playing golf with prospective clients, returning calls and emails quickly, and meeting with clients for coffee or a meal.
At its most basic level, marketing seeks to match a company's products and services to customers who want access to those products. Matching products to customers ultimately ensures profitability.
Formal Definition:
""Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large. ""
—Official definition from the American Marketing Association, approved 2017.
1
What Are the 4 P's of Marketing?
Product, price, place, and promotion are
the Four Ps
of marketing. The Four Ps collectively make up the essential mix a company needs to market a product or service. Neil Borden popularized the idea of the
marketing mix
and the concept of the Four Ps in the 1950s.

Product
Product refers to an item or items the business plans to offer to customers. The product should seek to fulfill an absence in the market or fulfill consumer demand for a greater amount of a product already available. Before they can prepare an appropriate campaign, marketers need to understand what product is being sold, how it stands out from its competitors, whether the product can also be paired with a secondary product or
product line
, and whether there are substitute products in the market.
Price
Price refers to how much the company will sell the product for. When establishing a price, companies must consider the unit cost price, marketing costs, and distribution expenses. Companies must also consider the price of competing products in the marketplace and whether their proposed price point is sufficient to represent a reasonable alternative for consumers.
Place
Place refers to the distribution of the product. Key considerations include whether the company will sell the product through a physical storefront, online, or through both distribution channels. When it's sold in a storefront, what kind of physical product placement does it get? When it's sold online, what kind of digital product placement does it get?
Promotion
Promotion, the fourth P, is the integrated marketing communications campaign. Promotion includes a variety of
activities such as advertising
, selling, sales promotions, public relations, direct marketing, sponsorship, and
guerrilla marketing
.
Promotions vary depending on what stage of the product life cycle the product is in. Marketers understand that consumers associate a product’s price and distribution with its quality, and they take this into account when devising the overall marketing strategy.
Important
Marketing refers to any activities undertaken by a company to promote the buying or selling of a service. If there is a limited quantity of a product, a company may market itself in an attempt to be better positioned as one of the few who get to buy something.
Types of Marketing Strategies
Marketing is comprised of an incredibly broad and diverse set of strategies. The industry continues to evolve, and the strategies below may be better suited for some companies over others.
Traditional Marketing Strategies
Before technology and the Internet, traditional marketing was the primary way companies would market their goods to customers. The main types of traditional marketing strategies include:
Outdoor Marketing:
This entails public displays of advertising external to a consumer's house. This includes billboards, printed advertisements on benches, sticker wraps on vehicles, or advertisements on public transit.
Print Marketing:
This entails small, easily printed content that is easy to replicate. Traditionally, companies often mass-produced printed materials, as the printed content was the same for all customers. Today, more flexibility in printing processes means that materials can be differentiated.
Direct Marketing
:
This entails specific content delivered to potential customers. Some print marketing content could be mailed. Otherwise, direct marketing mediums could include coupons, vouchers for free goods, or pamphlets.
Electronic Marketing:
This entails the use of TV and radio for advertising. Through short bursts of digital content, a company can convey information to a customer through visual or auditory media that may grab a viewer's attention better than a printed form.
Event Marketing:
This entails attempting to gather potential customers at a specific location for the opportunity to speak with them about products or demonstrate products. This includes conferences, trade shows, seminars,
roadshows
, or private events.
Digital Marketing
The marketing industry has been forever changed with the introduction of digital marketing. From the early days of pop-up ads to targeted placements based on viewing history, there are now innovative ways companies can reach
customers through digital marketing
.
Search Engine Marketing:
This entails companies attempting to increase search traffic through two ways. First, companies can pay search engines for placement on result pages. Second, companies can emphasize search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to organically place high on search results.
E-mail Marketing:
This entails companies obtaining customer or potential customer e-mail addresses and distributing messages or newsletters. These messages can include coupons, discount opportunities, or advance notice of upcoming sales.
Social Media Marketing:
This entails
building an online presence
on specific social media platforms. Like search engine marketing, companies can place paid advertisements to bypass algorithms and obtain a higher chance of being seen by viewers. Otherwise, a company can attempt to organically grow by posting content, interacting with followers, or uploading media like photos and videos.
Affiliate Marketing:
This entails using third-party advertising to drive customer interest. Often, an affiliate that will get a
commission
from a sale will do affiliate marketing as the third party is incentivized to drive a sale for a good that is not their own original product.
Content Marketing:
This entails creating content, whether eBooks, infographics, video seminars, or other downloadable content. The goal is to create a product (often free) to share information about a product, obtain customer information, and encourage customers to continue with the company beyond the content.
Fast Fact
In 1978, Gary Thuerk sent a message to roughly 400 people using ARPANET, the first public packet-switched computer network. With that message, the first ever recorded spam e-mail message had been sent.
2
What Are the Benefits of Marketing?
Well-defined marketing strategies can benefit a company in several ways. It may be challenging to develop the right strategy or execute the plan; when done well, marketing can yield the following results:
Audience Generation.
Marketing allows a company to target specific people it believes will benefit from its product or service. Sometimes, people know they have the need. Other times, they don't realize it. Marketing enables a company to connect with a cohort of people that fit the demographic of whom the company aims to serve.
Inward Education.
Marketing is useful for collecting information to be processed internally to drive success. For example, consider
market research
that finds a certain product is primarily purchased by women aged 18 to 34 years old. By collecting this information, a company can better understand how to cater to this demographic, drive sales, and be more efficient with resources.
Outward Education.
Marketing can also be used to communicate with the world what your company does, what products you sell, and how your company can enrich the lives of others. Campaigns can be educational, informing those outside of your company why they need your product. In addition, marketing campaigns let a company introduce itself, its history, its owners, and its motivation for being the company it is.
Brand Creation.

Investopedia,"What is Sustainability? How Sustainabilities Work, Benefits, and Example","Close
Definition
Sustainability is the ability to maintain or support economic, environmental, or social processes over time without depleting natural resources.
What Is Sustainability?
In the broadest sense, sustainability refers to the ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time. In business and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term.
Key Takeaways
Sustainability is ability to maintain or support a process over time.
Sustainability is often broken into three core concepts: economic, environmental, and social.
Many businesses and governments have committed to sustainable goals, such as reducing their environmental footprints and conserving resources.
Some investors are actively embracing sustainability investments, known as ""green investments.""
Skeptics have accused some companies of ""greenwashing,"" the practice of misleading the public to make a business seem more environmentally friendly than it is.
How Sustainability Works
Accordingly, sustainable policies emphasize the future effect of any given policy or business practice on humans, ecosystems, and the wider economy. The concept often corresponds to the belief that without major changes to the way the planet is run, it will suffer irreparable damage.
As concerns about anthropogenic climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution have become more widespread, the world has shifted to embrace sustainable practices and policies, primarily through the implementation of
sustainable business practices
and increased investments in
green technology
.
3 Pillars of Sustainability
The idea of sustainability is often broken down into three pillars: economic, environmental, and social—also known informally as profits, planet, and people.
In that breakdown, the concept of ""economic sustainability"" focuses on conserving the natural resources that provide physical inputs for economic production, including both renewable and exhaustible inputs.

The concept of ""environmental sustainability"" adds greater emphasis on the life support systems, such as the atmosphere or soil, that must be maintained for economic production or human life to even occur. In contrast, social sustainability focuses on the human effects of economic systems, and the category includes attempts to eradicate poverty and hunger, as well as to combat inequality.
In 1983, the United Nations created the World Commission on Environment and Development to study the connection between ecological health, economic development, and social equity. The commission, then run by former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, published a report in 1987 that has become the standard in defining sustainable development.
That report describes sustainable development, or the blueprint for attaining sustainability, as ""meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""
1
2
Corporate Sustainability
In business contexts, sustainability refers to more than just environmentalism. Harvard Business School lists two ways to measure sustainable business practices: the effect a business has on the environment, and the effect a business has on society, with the goal of sustainable practice being to have a positive impact on at least one of those areas.
3
Important
Corporate sustainability emerged as a component of corporate ethics in response to public concerns of long-term damage caused by a focus on short-term profits.
This view of responsibility encourages businesses to balance long-term benefits with immediate returns, and the goal of pursuing inclusive and environmentally sound objectives. This covers a broad array of
possible practices
. Cutting emissions, lowering energy usage, sourcing products from fair-trade organizations, and ensuring their physical waste is disposed of properly and with a smaller carbon footprint would qualify as moves toward sustainability.
Companies have also set
sustainability goals
such as a commitment to zero-waste packaging by a certain year, or to reduce overall emissions by a certain percentage.
Many corporations have made such sustainability promises in recent years. For example, Walmart Stores, Inc. (
WMT
) has pledged to reach zero emissions by 2040.
4
Morgan Stanley has pledged net-zero ""financed emissions"" by 2050.
5
Google has pledged to operate carbon-free by 2030.
6
The push for
sustainability
is evident in areas such as energy generation as well, where the focus has been on finding new deposits to outpace the drawdown on existing reserves. Some electricity companies, for example, now publicly state goals for energy generation from sustainable sources such as wind, hydropower, and solar.
Because these policies tend to generate public goodwill, some companies have been accused of ""
greenwashing
,"" the practice of providing a false impression that makes a business seem more environmentally friendly than it is.
Cost Cutting
Moreover, many companies have been criticized for cost-cutting measures that make it harder to evaluate their sustainability. For example, many companies might move some parts of their business to less-regulated markets, such as by
offshoring
production to obtain cheaper labor. This can make it harder to assess the costs of production on workers and the environment.
7
Sustainability practices ""significantly affect"" the offshoring activities of multinational corporations, according to an examination of data from 1,080 multinational corporations.
8
Challenges Surrounding Business Sustainability
The switch to sustainability can be difficult. The Santa Fe Institute outlines three major impediments for firms seeking to improve their environmental impacts: First, it is hard to actually understand the impact of any individual firm. Second, it is difficult to rank the environmental impact of some activities, and finally, it is difficult to predict how economic agents respond to changing incentives.
9
Sustainable investing surveys over the past couple of years have suggested that half (or in some cases, more than half) of investors say that sustainability is ""fundamental"" to investing strategy.
10
Not everyone concerned with investments shares the enthusiasm. In July 2021, for instance, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce argued that not only would
environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) disclosure mandates violate the agency's authority, but it may also ""undermine financial and economic stability.""
According to Peirce, the ""inherently political"" sustainability metrics were ""unabashedly"" created to direct capital toward certain businesses. In response to public comments and regulatory pressure to look into such mandates, Peirce said that it would be a violation of the SEC's ""historically agnostic approach"" to regulations.
11
Eiji Hirano, a former chairman of the board of visitors for Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, has said that there's a bubble in
ESG investing
and that the fund needs to rethink its ESG investments, according to interviews with
Bloomberg News
.
12
Benefits of Business Sustainability
In addition to the social benefits of improving the environment and elevating human needs, there are also financial benefits for companies that successfully implement sustainability strategies. Using resources sustainability can improve the long-term viability of a business concern, just as cutting waste and pollution can also help a company save money.
For example, using more efficient lighting and plumbing fixtures can help a company save on utility bills, as well as improve its public image. There may also be government tax incentives for companies that adopt certain sustainability practices.
Sustainability can also make a company more attractive to investors. A 2019 HEC Paris Research paper showed that shareholders value the ethical dimensions of a firm so much that they are willing to pay $.70 more to purchase a share in a firm that gives a dollar or more per share to charities. The study also revealed a loss in valuation for firms perceived as exercising a negative social impact.
13
Based on interviews with senior executives across 43 global investing firms,
Harvard Business Review
has argued that the perception among some business leaders that environmental, social, and governance issues are not mainstream in the investment community is outdated.
14
The ""sea change"" in investor attitudes described by
Harvard Business Review
draws on the increased commitments of investors. The Principles for Responsible Investment, a United Nations-supported effort to bring these issues into investing, had 63 investment companies with $6.5 trillion in assets under management that committed when it launched in 2006. In 2018, it had 1,715 companies with $81.7 trillion in assets.
15
Warning
While it's tempting to support companies that seem environmentally friendly, some companies are less sustainable than they seem. This use of misleading advertisements or branding to create a false impression of sustainability is sometimes called ""
greenwashing
.""
Creating a Sustainable Business Strategy
Many corporations are seeking to integrate sustainability practices into their core business models. Companies can adopt sustainability strategies in the same way that they develop their other
strategic plans
.
The first step to integrating sustainability practices is to identify a specific weakness shortcoming. For example, a company might determine that it generates
too much waste
, or that its hiring practices are causing harm to the surrounding communities.

Vega is the amount an option's price is expected to change for a 1% change in implied volatility.
Vega measures an option's price sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset's volatility. Specifically, vega is the amount that an option contract's price reacts to a 1% change in the underlying asset's implied volatility.
Newer options traders often overlook vega, but it's an important Greek to monitor, especially in volatile market conditions. In addition, understanding vega allows traders to capitalize on changes in market sentiment, even when the underlying asset's price remains relatively stable.
1
Key Takeaways
Vega measures an option price's value relative to changes in the implied volatility of an underlying asset.
It's the price change in an option given a 1% change in implied volatility.
Both call and put options have positive vega, meaning they both increase in value as volatility rises (and vice versa).
Options that are at-the-money and longer term have comparatively higher vega.
Traders can use vega to hedge against or speculate on changes in volatility.
Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
Understanding Vega
A higher vega means the option's price is more sensitive to changes in volatility. For example, if an option has a vega of 0.20, a 1% increase in the underlying asset's volatility will increase the option's price by $0.20 per share. Since options typically represent 100 shares, this translates to a $20 increase in the option's total price. A 1% decline in volatility would similarly result in a $0.20 cut in the option price.
Traders look to vega when they expect significant changes in market volatility. For instance, if the volatility of a stock is anticipated to increase because of an upcoming earnings announcement, they might buy options with higher vega to benefit from the expected increase in volatility. Meanwhile, if a trader believes that volatility will decrease, they might sell such options, expecting the option's value to drop as vega decreases with the drop in volatility.
Important
Both call and put options have a positive vega, meaning they both increase in value when volatility rises.
Vega-Neutral Strategies and Portfolios
Vega-neutral strategies are advanced options techniques designed to minimize or eliminate exposure to changes in
implied volatility
. These strategies aim to create positions—either part or the whole of your options portfolio—that stay relatively stable despite sudden shifts in volatility, allowing traders to focus on other market factors or specific directional views.
One common vega-neutral approach is the vega-neutral spread. This involves combining long and short options in positions that balance the positive and negative vegas. For example, a trader might buy an at-the-money option while simultaneously selling out-of-the-money options with the same expiration. The trader can create a position with a net vega close to zero by carefully selecting the number of contracts and strike prices.
For example, suppose a trader buys one at-the-money call option with a vega of 0.30 and simultaneously sells two out-of-the-money call options, each with a vega of 0.15. The net vega for this position is as follows:
(1 × 0.30) - (2 × 0.15) = 0
This position would be vega-neutral, meaning its value should remain relatively stable if implied volatility changes, all else being equal.
Calendar spreads can also be used to gain vega neutrality. This would involve selling near-term options and buying longer-term options in a ratio offsetting the vega exposure. The key is to balance the higher vega of long-dated options against the lower vega of short-dated options.
Maintaining vega neutrality requires active management. As market conditions change and options approach expiration, the vega profile of the position can shift, requiring you to adjust to keep your holdings neutral.
Nevertheless, vega-neutral strategies can be particularly worthwhile in the following scenarios:
When a trader has a specific view of the underlying asset's direction but wants to isolate that bet from volatility changes.
During periods of high volatility when the cost of options is elevated, a trader wants to mitigate the risk of a volatility collapse.
As part of a larger portfolio to hedge against volatility risk in other positions.
These strategies can be difficult to carry out and track, requiring sophisticated modeling and frequent rebalancing.
Volatility and Vega
Volatility measures the amount and speed at which price moves up and down and can be based on recent changes in price, historical price changes, and expected price moves in a trading instrument. Future-dated options have positive vega, while options that expire immediately have negative vega. The reason for these values is fairly obvious. Option holders tend to assign greater premiums for options expiring in the future than to those that expire immediately.
Vega is higher for options that are
at-the-money
(where the strike price is close to the underlying asset's current price) and for options with a longer time until expiration. This is because there's more uncertainty or potential for price movement, which makes the option more valuable.
As an option approaches its expiration date, vega generally decreases. This is because the impact of volatility on the option’s price declines as there is less time for the underlying asset's price to move significantly.
Implied Volatility
Vega measures the theoretical price change for each percentage point move in implied volatility, which is calculated using an
option pricing model
that determines what the market prices are estimating an underlying asset's future volatility to be. Since implied volatility is a projection, it can deviate from the actual volatility in the future.
Just as price moves are not always uniform, neither is vega. Vega changes over time. Therefore, the traders who use it monitor it regularly. As mentioned, options approaching expiration tend to have lower vegas compared with similar options that are further away from expiration.
2
Tip
Vega is one of the
Greeks
used in options analysis. Vega is also used by some traders to hedge against changes in implied volatility.
Example of Vega
To pull these considerations together, let's examine a hypothetical scenario involving Apple Inc. (
AAPL
) stock with an options trader monitoring the impact of vega on their position.
Current AAPL Stock Price
: $225
Option type
: A call option with a strike price of $225 (at-the-money)
Expiration date
: Three months from today
Implied volatility
: 25%
Starting option premium
: $10 per share (total premium of $1,000 for one contract covering 100 shares)
Vega
: 0.20
In this scenario, the call option has a vega of 0.20. So, for every 1% change in the implied volatility of AAPL, the call option price is expected to change by $0.20 per share. Since standard options contracts typically cover 100 shares, the total change in the option's price would be $20 per 1% change in volatility.
2
Increasing Volatility
Now, suppose the trader anticipates that AAPL's implied volatility will rise from 25% to 30% because of an upcoming major product release or earnings announcement. Here's what happens:
Implied volatility increase
: 5% (from 25% to 30%)
Vega impact
: The option's price would increase by $0.20 × 5 = $1.00 per share.
New option premium
: $10 (starting premium) + $1.00 (increase due to Vega) = $11 per share
Total increase in option price
: $1.00 × 100 shares = $100
New total option value
: $1,100
In this scenario, the trader could sell the option for $1,100, realizing a profit of $100 from the increase in implied volatility, even if the stock price remains unchanged.
Decreasing Volatility
Next, let's say that volatility falls after a product release or earnings announcement as uncertainty subsides. As such, implied volatility drops from 25% to 20%.
Implied volatility decrease
: 5% (from 25% to 20%)
Vega impact
: The option's price would decrease by $0.20 × 5 = $1.00 per share.
New option premium
: $10 (starting premium) - $1.00 (decrease because of Vega) = $9 per share
Total decrease in option price
: $1.00 × 100 shares = $100
New total option value
: $900
In this case, the option's value decreases to $900, resulting in a $100 loss for the trader, given the decrease in implied volatility.
By buying the option at a starting premium of $10 per share, the trader is positioned to benefit from anticipated changes in volatility. If they correctly predict an increase in volatility, they can then sell the option for a higher price, capturing the profit. However, should vo",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp
Investopedia,"GDP Per Capita: Definition, Uses, and Highest Per Country","Close
Definition
GDP per capita is a metric that indicates an economy's gross domestic product per person, used as a measure of prosperity.
What Is GDP Per Capita?
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is an economic metric that breaks down a country’s economic output to a per-person allocation. Economists use GDP per capita to determine the prosperity of countries based on their economic growth. Countries with a higher GDP per capita tend to be those that are industrial and developed and have smaller populations compared to others.
Key Takeaways
Gross domestic product per capita is a country’s economic output per person.
It’s calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population.
GDP per capita, along with overall GDP, is used by economists to analyze the economic prosperity of a country and to compare it to other countries.
It’s important to consider how much GDP and population each affect the GDP per capita figure.
Small, rich countries and more developed industrial nations tend to have the highest GDP per capita.
How GDP Per Capita Works
Gross domestic product
per capita is a global measurement used by economists to gauge the prosperity of nations based on economic growth.
There are a few ways to analyze a country’s wealth and prosperity. GDP per capita is the most universal because its components are regularly tracked on a global scale, providing ease of calculation and usage.
Income per capita
is another measure for global prosperity analysis, but it’s less broadly used.
1
2
The most basic interpretation of GDP per capita shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each individual citizen. Alternatively, GDP per capita translates to a measure of national wealth because GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure.
1
GDP Per Capita vs. GDP
GDP itself is the primary measure of a country’s economic productivity. A country’s GDP shows the market value of the goods and services it produces. The
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
reports GDP every quarter in the United States. Economists watch this quarterly report closely for the quarter-over-quarter and annual growth figures that can assist them in analyzing the overall health of the economy.

GDP per capita is often analyzed along with GDP. It relates to both a country’s GDP and its population, so it can be important to understand how each factor affects GDP per capita growth.

Implications of GDP Per Capita
Governments can use GDP per capita to understand how their economies are growing along with their
populations
. GDP per capita analysis on a national level can provide insights into a country’s domestic population influence.
Look at each variable’s contribution to the per capita figure to understand how an economy is growing or contracting relative to its population. There can be several numerical relationships that affect GDP per capita.
Growth can potentially be the result of technological advances that increase productivity with no change in population if a country’s GDP per capita is growing while the population level remains stable. Technology can be a revolutionary factor that helps countries increase their per capita rankings even as population figures are unchanged or decline.
Important
Some countries may have a high GDP per capita but a small population. This usually means that they’ve built a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources.
Negative GDP Per Capita Growth
A nation may have consistent economic growth but GDP per capita growth will be negative if its population is growing faster than its GDP. This isn’t a problem for most
established economies
because even a tepid pace of economic growth can still outpace their population growth rates.
However, countries with existing low levels of GDP per capita, such as nations in Africa, and rapidly increasing populations combined with little GDP growth can experience a steady erosion of living standards.
5
GDP and Population Growth
Both GDP and population are factors in the per capita equation, so countries with the highest GDP may or may not have the highest GDP per capita.
Global GDP per capita decreased by an average of 1.9% in 2023 (latest information), according to the latest
World Bank
data.
6
Economies such as those of China and India have achieved GDP per capita growth rates well above the global average in the 21st century despite their populations of over a billion people each. This is thanks to the financial reforms initiated by China in the late 1970s and by India in the mid-1990s.

Global Growth Projections
The IMF provides a regular outlook on the global growth of GDP. This growth can affect the outlook for the growth of GDP per capita.
The IMF expects global GDP growth of 3.3% in 2025 and 2026, primarily due to upward revisions in the U.S. economy offsetting declines in other major economies, as well as declining global headline inflation.
10
Advanced economies are expected to see a slight acceleration in growth, from 1.7% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025 to 1.8% in 2026. While growth rates in advanced economies will be lower than those in developing economies, developing economies will see flat to modest growth, from 4.2% in 2024 to the same in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026.
10
How Is GDP Per Capita Calculated?
The calculation formula to determine GDP per capita is a country’s gross domestic product divided by its population. GDP per capita reflects a nation’s standard of living.
1
Which Countries Have the Highest GDP Per Capita?
The countries with the highest GDP per capita tend to be those that are the most industrialized and developed. According to the IMF, the three countries with the highest GDP per capita in 2025 are Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Ireland.
8
What’s the Difference Between GDP Per Capita and Per Capita Income?
GDP per capita is the economic output of a nation per person. It’s used to measure the prosperity of a nation. Per capita income is the amount of money earned per person. It’s used to determine the standard of living and quality of life of a population.
Which Country Has the Lowest GDP Per Capita?
Burundi, South Sudan, and Malawi have the lowest GDP per capita in 2025 of the countries for which the IMF publishes data.
8
What Country Has the Highest Population?
India has the highest population, with 1.46 billion people as of 2025, according to the World Population Review.
11
The Bottom Line
GDP per capita is a popular metric used to measure the average prosperity and well-being of a country. It takes populations into account, unlike some other measures of economic productivity, allowing easy comparisons between countries with different populations.

What Is the Q Ratio or Tobin's Q?
The Q ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, measures the relationship between
market valuation
and
intrinsic value
. In other words, it estimates whether a business or market is overvalued or
undervalued
.
The Q ratio is calculated by dividing the market value of a company by its assets' replacement cost. Thus, equilibrium is when market value equals replacement cost.
Key Takeaways
The Q ratio was popularized by Nobel Laureate James Tobin and invented in 1966 by Nicholas Kaldor.
The Q ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, measures whether a firm or an aggregate market is relatively over- or undervalued.
It relies on the concepts of market value and replacement value.
The simplified Q ratio is the equity market value divided by equity book value.
Formula and Calculation of the Q Ratio
Tobin’s Q
=
Total Market Value of Firm
Total Asset Value of Firm
\text{Tobin's Q}=\frac{\text{Total Market Value of Firm}}{\text{Total Asset Value of Firm}}
Tobin’s Q
=
Total Asset Value of Firm
Total Market Value of Firm
​
The Q ratio is calculated as the market value of a company divided by the replacement value of the firm's assets. Since the replacement cost of total assets is difficult to estimate, another version of the formula is often used by analysts to estimate Tobin's Q ratio. It is as follows:
Tobin’s Q
=
Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value
Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value
\text{Tobin's Q} = \frac{\text{Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value}}{\text{Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value}}
Tobin’s Q
=
Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value
Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value
​
Often, the assumption is made the market value of liabilities and the book value of a company's liabilities are equivalent, since market value typically does not account for a firm's liabilities. This provides a simplified version of the Tobin's Q ratio as the following:
Tobin’s Q
=
Equity Market Value
Equity Book Value
\text{Tobin's Q} = \frac{\text{Equity Market Value}}{\text{Equity Book Value}}
Tobin’s Q
=
Equity Book Value
Equity Market Value
​
What the Q Ratio Can Tell You
The Tobin's Q ratio is a quotient popularized by
James Tobin
of Yale University, Nobel laureate in economics, who hypothesized that the combined
market value
of all the companies on the stock market should be about equal to their replacement costs.
While Tobin is often attributed as its creator, this ratio was first proposed in an academic publication by economist Nicholas Kaldor in 1966. In earlier texts, the ratio is sometimes referred to as ""Kaldor's v.""
1
A low Q ratio—between 0 and 1—means that the cost to replace a firm's assets is greater than the value of its stock. This implies that the stock is undervalued. Conversely, a high Q (greater than 1) implies that a firm's stock is more expensive than the
replacement cost
of its assets, which implies that the stock is
overvalued
.
This measure of stock valuation is the driving factor behind investment decisions in Tobin's Q ratio. When applied to the market as a whole, we can gauge whether an entire market is relatively overbought or undervalued; we can represent this relationship as follows:
Q Ratio (Market)
=
Market Capitalization of all Companies
Replacement Value of all Companies
\text{Q Ratio (Market)} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization of all Companies}}{\text{Replacement Value of all Companies}}
Q Ratio (Market)
=
Replacement Value of all Companies
Market Capitalization of all Companies
​
For either a firm or a market, a ratio greater than one would theoretically indicate that the market or company is overvalued. A ratio that is less than one would imply that it is undervalued.
Underlying these simple equations is an equally simple intuition regarding the relationship between price and value. In essence, Tobin’s Q Ratio asserts that a business (or a market) is worth what it costs to replace. The cost necessary to replace the business (or market) is its
replacement value
.
It might seem logical that fair market value would be a Q ratio of 1.0. But, that has not historically been the case.
Prior to 1995 (for data as far back as 1945), the U.S. Q ratio never reached 1.0. During the first quarter of 2000, the Q ratio hit 2.15, while in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.66. As of the second quarter of 2020, the Q ratio was 2.12.
2
1.730
The Q ratio for the entire U.S. stock market, as of March 31, 2024. In other words, the market value of all public companies is 73% greater than the replacement cost of all their assets.
3
Replacement Value and the Q Ratio
Replacement value (or replacement cost) refers to the cost of replacing an existing asset based on its current market price. For example, the replacement value of a one-terabyte hard drive might be just $50 today, even if we paid $500 for the same storage space a few years ago.
In this scenario, ascertaining the replacement value would be easy because there is a robust market for hard drives from which to examine prices. To determine what a one-terabyte hard drive is worth, we would simply need to determine what it would cost to buy a one-terabyte hard drive (of comparable quality and specifications) from one of the many different suppliers on the market. In many cases, however, the replacement value of assets can prove much more elusive than this.
For instance, consider a business that owns complicated software tailor-made for its operations. Because of its highly specialized nature, there may not be any comparable alternatives available on the market. Unlike our previous example, we could not simply check to see how much similar software is selling for, because sufficiently similar software would not exist. It would thus be difficult, if not impossible, to render an objective estimate of the software’s replacement value.
Similar circumstances present themselves in a variety of business contexts, from complex industrial machinery and obscure
financial assets
to intangible assets such as
goodwill
. Due to the inherent difficulty of determining the replacement value of these and similar assets, many investors do not regard Tobin’s Q Ratio to be a reliable tool for valuing individual companies.
Example of How to Use the Q-Ratio
The formula for Tobin's Q ratio takes the total market value of the firm and divides it by the total asset value of the firm. For example, assume that a company has $35 million in assets. It also has 10 million shares outstanding that are trading for $4 a share. In this example, the Tobin's Q ratio would be:

Since the ratio is greater than 1.0, the market value exceeds the replacement value and so we could say the firm is overvalued and might be a sale.
An undervalued company, one with a ratio of less than one, would be attractive to corporate raiders or potential purchasers, as they may want to purchase the firm instead of creating a similar company. This would likely result in increased interest in the company, which would increase its stock price, which in turn increase its Tobin's Q ratio.
As for overvalued companies, those with a ratio higher than one, they may see increased competition. A ratio higher than one indicates that a firm is earning a rate higher than its replacement cost, which would cause individuals or other companies to create similar types of businesses to capture some of the profits. This would lower the existing firm's market shares, reduce its market price and cause its Tobin's Q ratio to fall.
Limitations of Using the Q Ratio
Tobin's Q is still used in practice, but others have since found that
fundamentals
predict investment results much better than the Q ratio, including the rate of profit—either for a company or the average rate of profit for a nation's economy.
Others, like Doug Henwood in his book
Wall Street: How It Works and For Whom
, find that the Q ratio fails to accurately predict investment outcomes over an important time period.

The data for Tobin's original (1977) paper covered the years 1960 to 1974, a period for which Q seemed to explain investment pretty well. But looking at other time periods, the Q fails to predict over- or undervalued markets or firms. While the Q and the investmen",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qratio.asp

Definition
Vesting is a process by which an employee obtains ownership rights in work-related benefits, such as stock options, stock shares, and certain retirement plan assets.
What Is Vesting?
Vesting, whereby employees gain non-forfeitable ownership of certain assets or benefits, requires employees to work for a company for a specified term of years.
Vesting is a way for employers to keep top-performing employees at their companies. When an employee becomes vested in employer-matching retirement benefits like a
401(k)
or
stock options
, they have non-forfeitable ownership rights to those assets.
Key Takeaways
Being vested gives an employee non-forfeitable ownership rights to certain assets.
Employee contributions to an employer-sponsored retirement plan are always immediately vested; employer contributions may or may not be.
A common vesting schedule is three to five years.
Investopedia / Sydney Saporito
How Vesting Works
Employees commonly contribute a percentage of their paycheck to their 401(k)s, and their employer may
match
part or all of that contribution. Employee contributions immediately vest and are completely owned by the employee.
1
Employer contributions to a 401(k) plan
might or might not vest immediately
. A company may have a vesting schedule that determines when employees acquire full ownership of the portion contributed by the employer.
In fact, matched dollars usually take several years to vest, meaning an employee must stay with the company long enough to be eligible to receive them.

The vesting process for stock bonuses offers employers a valuable employee retention tool. For example, an employee might receive 100
restricted stock units
as an annual bonus.
To entice this valued employee to remain with the company for five years, the stock may vest according to the following schedule:
25 units in the second year after the bonus was awarded
25 units in year three
25 units in year four
25 units in year five
If the employee left the company after year three, only 50 units would be vested. The other 50 would be forfeited. This means the employee would have ownership rights for 50 units and lose the opportunity to own 50 more.
Important
Employee contributions to an employer-sponsored retirement plan are always considered 100% vested when made.
1
Types of Vesting
Cliff Vesting Schedule:
Gives the employee ownership of 100% of the employer’s contributions all at once after a certain number of years.
1
Graded Vesting Schedule:
Gives the employee ownership of a percentage of the employer’s contribution each year.
1
Traditional pension plans, for example, might have a five-year cliff vesting schedule or a three- to seven-year graded vesting schedule.
Although an employee may be fully vested in their employer’s contributions, it does not mean they can withdraw that money whenever they want without penalty.
They are still subject to the plan’s rules, which generally require them to reach age 59½ before allowing penalty-free withdrawals.
Where Is Vesting Used Besides Retirement Plans?
Vesting is common in wills and bequests and often takes the form of a set waiting period to finalize bequests following the
testator's
death.
What Does 3 Year Vesting Mean?
This means that after a period of three years, the employee will be fully (100%) vested in the assets in the account. They will now own and control those assets, which are typically the employer-matching contributions set aside for the employee.
What Is a Common Vesting Period?
A common vesting period is three to five years, but the period is set by the employer.
2
Another common option is the graded vesting schedule. In this case, if the vesting were graded over a six-year period, after the first year, the employee would be vested in 0% of the assets. After years two, three, four, five, and six, they'd be vested in 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the assets, respectively.
1
Why Would Employers Offer Stock Options on a Vested Schedule?
Startup companies often offer grants of common stock or access to an employee stock option plan to employees, service providers, vendors, board members, or other parties as part of their compensation. To encourage loyalty among employees and keep them engaged and focused on the company's success, such grants or options are subject to a vesting period during which they cannot be sold.
The Bottom Line
Vesting refers to the process employees must go through to unlock their ownership rights to assets and benefits. Employers commonly require employees to work for a company for several years to become vested.
When an employee is vested in employer-matching retirement funds, they have non-forfeitable ownership rights to those assets.

What Is Enterprise Value (EV)?
Enterprise value (EV) measures a company’s total value. Its calculation includes not only the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt, as well as any cash or cash equivalents on the company’s balance sheet. It is often used as a more comprehensive alternative to
market capitalization
when valuing a company.
Key Takeaways
Enterprise value (EV) measures a company’s total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization.
EV is calculated using information from a company's financial statement.
Enterprise value takes into account the market capitalization of a company, as well as short-term and long-term debt and any cash on the company’s balance sheet.
Enterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure a company’s performance.
Michela Buttignol / Investopedia
How Enterprise Value (EV) Works
Enterprise value (EV) differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm’s value. EV tells investors or interested parties a company’s value and how much another company would need if it wanted to purchase that company.
A company’s EV can be negative if the total value of its cash and cash equivalents surpasses that of the combined total of its market cap and debts. This is a sign that a company is not using its assets very well—it has too much cash sitting around not being used. Extra cash can be used for many things, such as distributions, buybacks, expansion, research and development, maintenance, employee pay raises, bonuses, or paying off debts.
Enterprise value uses figures from a company’s financial statements and current market prices. The components that make up EV are:
Market cap
: The total value of a company’s outstanding common and preferred shares
Debt
: The sum of long-term and short-term debt
Preferred equity:
Preferred shares of equity need to be included as well since they are claimed on the company's equity not included in market capitalization.
Minority interest
: The equity value of a subsidiary with less than 50% ownership
Cash and cash equivalents
: The total amount of cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), drafts, money orders, commercial paper, marketable securities, money market funds, short-term government bonds, or Treasury bills that a company possesses

​
To calculate market capitalization—if not readily available online—you would multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt on the company’s balance sheet, including both short-term and long-term debt. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result.
Financial Ratios That Use Enterprise Value
Enterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure the performance of a company. For example, the
enterprise multiple
contains enterprise value. It relates the total value of a company from all sources to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).
EBITDA
measures a company’s ability to generate revenue and is used as an alternative to simple earnings or net income in some circumstances. It is usually positive even when earnings per share (EPS) is not.
EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment. Another figure, EBIT, can be used as a similar financial metric without the drawback of removing depreciation and amortization expenses related to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).
Note
EBITDA
= Net Income + Interest Expense + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization
Enterprise Multiple (EV/EBITDA Ratio)
The enterprise multiple (EV/EBITDA) metric is used as a valuation tool to compare the value of a company and its debt to the company’s cash earnings, less its non-cash expenses. As a result, it’s ideal for analysts and investors looking to compare companies within the same industry.
The enterprise multiple is useful when:
Comparing firms with different
degrees of financial leverage (DFLs)
Valuing capital-intensive businesses with high levels of depreciation and amortization
However, the enterprise multiple also has a few drawbacks. If
working capital
is growing, EBITDA will overstate cash flows from operations (CFO or OCF). Further, this measure ignores how different revenue recognition policies can affect a company’s OCF.
Because free cash flow to the firm captures the number of
capital expenditures (CapEx)
, it is more strongly linked with valuation theory than EBITDA. EBITDA will be a generally adequate measure if capital expenses equal depreciation expenses.
EV/Sales Ratio
Another commonly used multiple for determining the relative value of firms is the enterprise value-to-sales ratio, or
EV/sales
. EV/sales is regarded as a more accurate measure than the price/sales ratio since it considers the value and amount of debt that a company must repay at some point.
A company with a lower EV/sales multiple is often seen as more undervalued and therefore more attractive. The EV/sales ratio can be negative when the cash held by a company is more than the market capitalization and debt value. A negative EV/sales implies that a company can pay off all of its debts.
Enterprise Value vs. Market Cap
Why doesn’t market capitalization properly represent a firm’s value? It leaves a lot of essential factors out, such as a company’s debt and cash reserves. Enterprise value is a modification of market cap, as it incorporates debt and cash for determining a company’s value.
Important
Market capitalization is not intended to represent a company’s book value. Instead, it represents a company’s value as determined by market participants.
Imagine two identical widget manufacturers, Company A and Company B, have the same stock price of $4.32 per share. Each has 1 million outstanding shares with a market cap of $4.32 million.
Now, imagine Company A has $500,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $250,000 in total debt. Its EV (total worth) is:
($4.32 per share x 1 million shares) + $250,000 - $500,000 = $4.07 million
Company B, on the other hand, has $1 million in cash and $250,000 in debt. Its EV is:
($4.32 per share x 1 million shares) + $250,000 - $1,000,000 = $3.57 million
The companies looked identical when using just their market capitalization. However, once the EV takes into account both debt and cash, the value of Company A is significantly higher.

What Is the European Union (EU)?
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic alliance of 27 countries. It promotes democratic values in its member nations and is one of the world's most powerful trade blocs. Nineteen of the countries share the
euro
as their official currency.
The EU grew out of a desire to strengthen economic and political cooperation throughout the continent of Europe in the wake of World War II.
Its
gross domestic product
(GDP) totaled 14.45 trillion euros in 2021. That's about US $15.49 trillion. The GDP of the U.S. for the same period was about US $23 trillion.
1
2
Key Takeaways
The EU is a political and economic grouping of 27 countries committed to shared democratic values.
The euro is the shared official currency of 19 EU members known collectively as the eurozone.
In recent years, the EU has expanded to include many of the countries that had been socialist states before the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In the 2016 referendum known as Brexit, the U.K. voted to leave the EU; it officially left in 2020.
3
History of the European Union
The EU traces its roots to the European Coal and Steel Community, which was founded in 1950 and had just six members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. It became the European Economic Community in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome and subsequently was renamed the
European Community
(EC).
4
5
This served to deepen the integration of the member nations' foreign, security, and internal affairs policies. The EU established a common market the same year to promote the free movement of goods, services, people, and capital across its internal borders.
The EC initially focused on a common agricultural policy and the elimination of
customs barriers
. Denmark, Ireland, and the U.K. joined in 1973 in the first wave of expansion. Direct elections to the European Parliament began in 1979.
5
Creation of a Common Market
In 1986, the Single European Act embarked on a six-year plan to create a common European market by harmonizing national regulations.
5
The
Maastricht Treaty
took effect in 1993, replacing the EC with the EU. The euro debuted as a common single currency for participating EU members on January 1, 1999.
6
Denmark and the U.K. negotiated ""opt-out"" provisions that permitted countries to retain their own currencies if they chose.
7
Several newer members of the EU have also either not yet met the criteria for adopting the euro or chosen to opt out.
The European Debt Crisis
In the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the EU and the
European Central Bank
struggled to deal with high sovereign debt and sluggish growth in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece.
Greece and Ireland received financial bailouts from the EU in 2010 conditioned on the implementation of fiscal
austerity
measures. Portugal followed in 2011. A second Greek bailout was needed in 2012.
8
The crisis abated after the EU and the European Central Bank adopted a series of measures to support the sovereign and banking-sector debt of the affected countries.
Long-Term Measures
These included the establishment in October 2012 of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), established to assist EU members experiencing severe financial problems, including an inability to access the bond markets. The ESM supplanted the temporary European Financial Stability Facility backstop in place since 2010.
9
The European Central Bank conducted a series of ""targeted longer-term refinancing operations"" in 2014, 2016, and 2019 to provide financing on favorable terms for EU financial institutions.
10
In 2015, the EU loosened the provisions of the 2011 Stability and Growth Act requiring member states to target public debt of below 60% of gross domestic product and annual government budget deficits below 3% of GDP over the medium term.
11
The same year, a new EU agency, the Single Resolution Board, assumed responsibility for resolving bank failures in the euro area.
12
EU's North-South Issues
While the relief measures addressed the crisis, they haven't tackled one of its principal causes—the wide disparity in wealth and economic growth between the EU's heavily industrialized north and its poorer southern periphery, which remains less urbanized and more dependent on agriculture.
13
Because the industrialized north and the more rural south share a common currency, struggling southern economies can't take advantage of
currency depreciation
to improve their international competitiveness. Without currency depreciation, southern exporters ultimately struggle to compete with their northern rivals, which benefit from faster productivity growth.
14
How Region Disparities Are Addressed in the U.S.
In the U.S., federal
transfer payments
help to address similar economic disparities between regions and states. States with higher average incomes tend to contribute a disproportionately large share of federal revenue, while those with lower incomes tend to account for a higher share of federal outlays.
15
In the EU, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted joint spending measures some have called ""an incomplete and fragile fiscal union in the making.""
16
The Brexit Bomb
After rejecting earlier calls for a popular referendum on the U.K.'s EU membership, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron promised a vote in 2013 and scheduled it in 2016. It was a time of growing popularity for the U.K. Independence Party, which opposed EU membership.
After trailing in late polls, the
Leave option won
with nearly 52% of the vote on June 23, 2016. Cameron resigned the next day. The U.K. officially left the EU on January 31, 2020.
3
17
In July 2020, a report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of the U.K. Parliament noted widespread media reports of Russian efforts on behalf of the Leave option and faulted the government for failing to investigate Russian involvement in British politics.
18
19
What Is the Purpose of the European Union?
The European Union was created to bind the nations of Europe closer together for the economic, social, and security welfare of all. It is one of several efforts after World War II to bind together the nations of Europe into a single entity.
20
How Is the European Union Changing in the 21st Century?
The original members of the European Union were the nations of Western Europe. In the 21st century, the EU has expand membership to the Eastern European nations that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its current member nations include Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.
20
Why Was the European Union Created?
The overarching purpose of the European Union, in the years after World War II, was to put an end to the devastating wars that had wracked Europe for centuries. At the same time, it became increasingly clear that a united Europe would have far greater economic and political power than the individual nations in the post-war world.
21
The Bottom Line
The EU is a powerful alliance of 27 European countries that promotes democratic values among its members. It serves to faciliate political and economic integration throughout the region. Many, though not all, of its members share the euro as their official currency. Historically, it was made up primarily of the nations of Western Europe; it has since expanded to include member nations that had previously been socialist states prior to the collapse of the USSR. In 2020, the U.K. officially left the EU.

What Is Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)?
Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is a company's average after-tax
cost of capital
from all sources, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and other forms of debt. It represents the average rate that a company expects to pay to finance its business.
WACC is a common way to determine the
required rate of return (RRR)
because it expresses, in a single number, the return that bondholders and shareholders demand in return for providing the company with
capital
. A company's WACC is likely to be higher if its
stock
is relatively volatile or if its debt is considered risky because investors will want greater returns to compensate them for the level of risk.
Key Takeaways
Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents a company's cost of capital, with each category of capital (debt and equity) proportionately weighted.
WACC can be calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source by its relevant weight in terms of market value, then adding the results together to determine the total.
WACC is commonly used as a
hurdle rate
against which companies and investors can gauge the desirability of a given project or acquisition.
WACC is also used as the discount rate for future cash flows in discounted cash flow analysis.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
Understanding WACC
Calculating a company's WACC is useful for investors and stock analysts, as well company management. Each group will use WACC for different purposes.
In corporate finance, determining a company's cost of capital can be important for several reasons. For instance, WACC can be used as the
discount rate
for estimating the
net present value
of a project or acquisition.
If the company believes that a merger, for example, will generate a return higher than its cost of capital, then it's likely a good choice for the company. However, if it anticipates a return lower than its investors are expecting, there might be better uses for that capital.

To investors, WACC is an important tool in assessing a company's potential for profitability. In most cases, a lower WACC indicates a healthy business that's able to attract money from investors at a lower cost. A higher WACC usually coincides with businesses that are seen as riskier and need to compensate investors with higher returns to offset the level of volatility.
If a company only obtains financing through one source—say, common stock—then calculating its cost of capital would be relatively simple. If investors expected a
rate of return (RoR)
of 10% on their
shares
, the company's cost of capital would be the same as its cost of equity: 10%.
The same would be true if the company only used debt financing. For example, if the company paid an average yield of 5% on its bonds, its pre-tax cost of debt would be 5%. However, because interest payments are tax-deductible, the after-tax cost of debt would be lower, calculated as 5% × (1 - tax rate). This after-tax cost of debt would also represent the company's cost of capital in this scenario, since all the capital is debt.
However, many companies use both debt and equity financing in various proportions. This is where the calculation for WACC becomes valuable.
WACC Formula and Calculation
WACC is found by determining the proportions of debt and equity financing that a company uses to determine the total cost of capital. The equation is:
WACC

​
WACC is calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight and then adding those results together. In the above formula, E/V (equity over total financing) represents the proportion of equity-based financing, while D/V (debt over total financing) represents the proportion of debt-based financing. The WACC formula thus involves the summation of two terms:
(
E
V
×
R
e
)
\left ( \frac{ E }{ V} \times Re \right )
(
V
E
​

(
V
D
​
×
R
d
×
(
1
−
T
c
)
)
The former represents the weighted value of equity capital, while the latter represents the weighted value of debt capital.
Suppose that a company obtained $1 million in debt financing and $4 million in equity financing by selling common shares.
The total capital would be $5 million (debt plus equity), so tose proportions would be:
E/V = $4,000,000 / $5,000,000 = 0.8
D/V = $1,000,000 / $5,000,000 = 0.2
You can double check that the proportions are correct because 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0.
Tip
WACC can be
calculated using Excel
.
Special Considerations
Calculating Cost of Equity
Cost of equity
(Re in the formula) can be a bit tricky to calculate because share capital does not technically have an explicit value. When companies reimburse bondholders, the amount they pay has a predetermined
interest rate
. On the other hand, equity has no concrete price that the company must pay. As a result, companies have to estimate the cost of equity (the rate of return that investors demand based on the expected
volatility
of the stock).
Because shareholders will expect to receive a certain
return on their investment
in a company, the equity holders' required rate of return is a cost from the company's perspective; if the company fails to deliver this expected return, shareholders may simply sell their shares, which can lead to a decrease in both share price and the company's value.
Important
The cost of equity is the total return that a company must generate to maintain a share price that will satisfy its investors.
Companies typically use the
capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
to arrive at the cost of equity (in CAPM, it's called the expected return of investment). Its important to note that this is not an exact calculation because companies have to lean on historical data, which can never accurately predict future growth.
1
Calculating Cost of Debt
Determining
cost of debt
(Rd in the formula), on the other hand, is a more straightforward process. This is often done by averaging the
yield to maturity
for a company's outstanding debts. This method is easier if you're looking at a publicly traded company that has to report its debt obligations.
For privately owned companies, you can look at the company's
credit rating
from firms such as Moody's and S&P Global and then add a relevant spread over risk-free assets to approximate the return that investors would demand.
Tip
Treasury bonds of the same maturity are a useful risk-free asset to use as a benchmark.
Businesses are able to deduct interest expenses from their taxes.
2
Because of this, the net cost of a company's debt is the amount of
interest
it is paying minus the amount of interest it can deduct on its taxes. This is why Rd x (1 - the corporate tax rate) is used to calculate the after-tax cost of debt.
WACC vs. Required Rate of Return (RRR)
The required rate of return is the minimum return that an investor will accept in exchange for their investment. If they expect that returns will be smaller than this number, they will put their money in a different investment.
One way to determine the RRR is by using the capital asset pricing model, which looks at a stock's volatility relative to the broader market (known as its
beta
). This is then used to estimate the return that stockholders will require.
Another method for identifying the RRR is by calculating WACC. The advantage of using WACC is that it takes the company's capital structure into account (how much it leans on debt finan",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp

Price elasticity of demand is a concept in economics that describes the relationship between a product's change in quantity demanded and a price increase, expressed as a ratio.
What Is Price Elasticity of Demand?
Price elasticity of demand measures how a change in price affects a product's demand. If a price change creates a large change in demand, it is considered elastic. If a price change creates a small or no change in demand, it is inelastic.
Key Takeaways
A good or service is considered perfectly elastic if the elasticity is infinite, meaning demand changes substantially even with a minimal price change.
If price elasticity is greater than 1, the good is elastic; if it is less than 1, it is inelastic.
If a good’s price elasticity is 0, there is no amount of price change that produces a change in demand, and it is perfectly inelastic.
If a price change leads to an equal percentage change in demand, the price elasticity is exactly 1, known as unitary elasticity.
If there are no good substitutes and the product is necessary, demand won’t change when the price goes up, making it inelastic.
Theresa Chiechi / Investopedia
Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand
Elasticity, when considering pricing and demand for goods and services, refers to how much demand for a good or service can change. You can think of elasticity as a rubber band—when demand for a good is elastic, it is like a stretchy rubber band and can stretch far beyond its original shape. If demand is inelastic, the rubber band was made very thick and tough, and you can't stretch it very far, if at all.
If demand for some goods is very
inelastic
, consumption won't change regardless of price. That is, a reduction in price does not increase demand much, and an increase in price does not hurt demand. This usually happens when there is no good substitute for a product, so consumers must continue purchasing it even if the price changes.
Gasoline, for example, has little price elasticity of demand. Drivers will continue to buy as much as they have to, as will industries such as airlines and trucking.
Other goods are much more elastic, so price changes for these goods cause substantial changes in their demand.

If the quantity demanded of a product changes greatly in response to changes in its price, it is elastic. That is, the demand point for the product is stretched far from its prior point. If the quantity purchased shows a small change after a change in its price, it is inelastic. The quantity demanded didn't stretch much from its prior point.
Price elasticity of demand can be expressed mathematically as:
Price Elasticity of Demand = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded ÷ Percentage Change in Price
Important
Marketing professionals often try to create inelastic demand for the products that they market. They achieve this by identifying a meaningful difference in their products from those that are available.
Factors That Affect Price Elasticity of Demand
A product's demand elasticity depends on various factors that can change over time. Some of these factors are within a business's control, while others are determined by market conditions.
Availability of Substitutes
The more easily a shopper can substitute one product for another, the more elastic the demand for those products will be. For example, if shoppers like coffee and tea equally, they will be happy to switch to tea if the price of coffee goes up. When this happens, the demand for coffee will fall. This is because coffee and tea are considered good
substitutes
for each other.
Urgency
The more
discretionary
a purchase is, the more its quantity demanded will fall in response to price increases. That is, the product demand has greater elasticity.
For example, imagine you're considering buying a new washing machine, but the current one still works; it's just old and outdated. If the price of a new washing machine goes up, you're likely to forgo that immediate purchase and wait until prices go down or the current machine breaks down.
The less discretionary a product is, the less its quantity demanded will fall in response to price changes. Inelastic examples include:
Luxury items, especially those purchased because of their brand names
Addictive products, such as cigarettes
Required add-on products, such as the correct ink for printers
One thing all these products have in common is that they lack good substitutes. If you really want an Apple iPad, then a Kindle Fire won't do, even if the price of the iPad goes up. People are generally not dissuaded by higher prices for their vices, and only one kind of ink cartridge will work in your printer.
Duration of Price Change
The length of time that the price change lasts also matters.
Demand response to price fluctuations
is different for a one-day sale than for a price change that lasts for a season or a year.
Clarity of time sensitivity is vital to understanding the price elasticity of demand and for comparing it with different products. Consumers may accept a
seasonal price fluctuation
rather than change their habits. For example, it will cost more to purchase a swimsuit in the summer than in the winter. But most consumers still buy their swimsuits in the summer because that's when they need them.
Types of Price Elasticity of Demand and Examples
Price elasticity of demand is shown as a number ranging from zero to infinity. This is calculated by dividing the percent of change in quantity demanded by the percent of change in price. Each number represents a different type of elasticity and, therefore, a different type of consumer behavior.

If the quantity of a product demanded or purchased changes more than the price changes, then the product is considered to be elastic. If the change in quantity purchased is the same as the price change, then the product is said to have unit (or unitary)
price elasticity
. And if the quantity purchased changes less than the price, then the product is deemed inelastic.
For example, if the price goes up by 5%, but the demand falls by 10%, the product is elastic. If a price change of 10% creates a 10% change in demand, the product shows unitary elasticity. And if a price increase of 10% doesn't change demand, the product is inelastic.
Example
Suppose that the price of apples falls by 6% from $1.99 a bushel to $1.87 a bushel. In response, grocery shoppers increase their apple purchases by 20%. The elasticity of apples is thus: 0.20 ÷ 0.06 = 3.33. In this case, the demand for apples is elastic.
What Makes a Product Elastic?
If a price change for a product causes a substantial change in either its supply or its demand, it is considered elastic. Generally, it means that there are acceptable substitutes for the product. Examples would be cookies, SUVs, and coffee.
What Makes a Product Inelastic?
If a price change for a product doesn’t lead to much, if any, change in its supply or demand, it is considered inelastic. Generally, it means that the product is considered a necessity. Examples include gasoline, milk, and natural gas.
What Is the Importance of Price Elasticity of Demand?
Knowing the price elasticity of demand for goods allows someone selling that good to make informed decisions about pricing strategies. This metric provides sellers with information about consumer pricing sensitivity. It is also crucial for manufacturers to determine their manufacturing plans, as well as for governments to assess how to impose taxes on goods.
The Bottom Line
Price elasticity of demand is a ratio that shows how much demand for a product changes when the price of that product changes. A ratio of greater than one indicates an elastic product; a ratio of less than one indicates an inelastic product.
Economists and marketers use price elasticity of demand to understand how consumer behavior changes in response to price. The more substitutes for a product the",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/priceelasticity.asp

A yield spread is the difference between the quoted rates of return of two different debt instruments.
What Is a Yield Spread?
A yield spread is the difference between yields on differing debt instruments of varying maturities, credit ratings, issuers, or risk levels. A yield spread is calculated by deducting the yield of one instrument from the other. This difference is most often expressed in
basis points (bps)
or percentage points.
Key Takeaways
A yield spread is the difference between the quoted rate of return on different debt instruments that have different characteristics.
The spread is straightforward to calculate since you subtract the yield of one from that of the other in terms of percentage or basis points.
Yield spreads are often quoted in terms of a yield versus U.S. Treasuries or a yield versus AAA-rated corporate bonds.
When yield spreads expand or contract, it can signal changes in the underlying economy or financial markets.
Yield spreads can come in varying types, including zero-volatility spreads, high-yield bond spreads, and option-adjusted spreads.
Investopedia / Ellen Lindner
How Yield Spreads Work
The yield spread is a key metric that bond investors use when gauging the level of expense for a bond or group of bonds. If one bond yields 7% and another one yields 4%, the spread is three percentage points or 300 bps. Non-Treasury bonds are generally evaluated based on the
difference between their yield and that of a Treasury bond
of comparable maturity.
Yield spreads are commonly quoted in terms of one yield versus that of U.S. Treasuries, where it is called the
credit spread
. For example, if the five-year
Treasury bond
is at 5% and the 30-year Treasury bond is at 6%, the yield spread between the two debt instruments is 1%. If the 30-year bond is trading at 6%, then based on the historical yield spread, the five-year bond should be trading at around 1%, making it very attractive at its
current yield
of 5%.
Because
bond yields
often change, yield spreads change, too:
The direction of the spread may increase or widen, meaning the yield difference between the two bonds increases, and one sector performs better than another.
When spreads narrow, the yield difference decreases and one sector performs more poorly than another.
Let's say
the yield on a high-yield bond index increases to 7.5% from 7%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield remains at 2%. The spread moved from 500 basis points to 550 basis points (the difference between the bond and the 10-year U.S. Treasury), which indicates that high-yield bonds underperformed Treasuries during that period.
Important
Yield spreads can be used to help predict
recessions
and economic recoveries, and may indicate how investors view economic conditions. Widening spreads typically lead to a positive yield curve, indicating stable economic conditions in the future. But when falling spreads contract, worsening economic conditions may be coming, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve.
Yield Spread vs. Credit Spread
A bond credit spread reflects the difference in yield between a treasury and corporate bond of the same maturity. Debt issued by the United States Treasury is used as the
benchmark
in the financial industry due to its risk-free status being backed by the
full faith and credit
of the U.S. government.
US Treasury (government-issued) bonds are considered to be the closest thing to a risk-free investment, as the probability of
default
is almost non-existent. Investors have the utmost confidence in getting repaid.
Types of Yield Spreads
There are a few different types of yield spreads, including the zero-volatility, high-yield bond, and the option-adjusted spread. We explore these in a little more detail below.
Zero-Volatility Spread (Z-Spread)
A
zero-volatility spread (Z-spread)
measures the spread realized by the investor over the entire
Treasury spot-rate curve
, assuming the bond would be held until maturity. This method can be a time-consuming process, as it requires a lot of calculations based on trial and error.
You would basically start by trying one spread figure and run the calculations to see if the present value of the cash flows equals the bond’s price. If not, you have to start over and keep trying until the two values are equal.
High-Yield Bond Spread
The
high-yield bond spread
is the percentage difference in current yields of various classes of high-yield bonds compared against investment-grade (e.g. AAA-rated) corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, or another benchmark bond measure. High-yield bond spreads that are wider than the historical average suggest greater credit and default risk for junk bonds.
Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)
An
option-adjusted spread (OAS)
converts the difference between the fair price and market price, expressed as a dollar value, and converts that value into a yield measure. Interest rate volatility plays an essential part in the OAS formula. The option embedded in the security can impact the cash flows, which is something that must be considered when calculating the value of the security.
Yield Spread and Risk
Typically, the higher the risk a bond or
asset class
carries, the higher its yield spread. When an investment is viewed as low-risk, investors do not require a large yield to tie up their cash. This occurs when the bond or asset is seen as safer, perhaps due to improved credit ratings, favorable economic conditions, or higher liquidity. In such scenarios, investors are willing to accept lower yields because the likelihood of default or significant losses is reduced. The narrowing of the yield spread indicates that investors require less compensation for the lower risk, which often reflects a more stable or secure investment environment.
However, if an investment is viewed as a higher risk, investors demand adequate compensation through a higher yield spread in exchange for taking on the risk of their principal declining. This is because investors are seeking extra returns for taking on the uncertainty and potential losses associated with the riskier asset. As a result, the yield spread between the riskier bond and the benchmark government bond widens. This wider spread reflects the market’s assessment of the increased likelihood of default, volatility, or other adverse factors impacting the riskier bond.
Term Spread and Yield Spread
Term spreads refer to the differences in yields between bonds or securities with varying maturities but similar credit quality. For instance, the term spread might compare the yields on short-term versus long-term government bonds or corporate bonds.
A steeper term spread typically indicates that investors expect higher interest rates in the future, which can be a sign of anticipated economic growth or
inflation
. While yield spreads focus on differences in credit risk or other factors affecting specific bonds, term spreads highlight the variation in yields based on maturity.
Both types of spreads help investors assess risk and make decisions, but term spreads provide insights into the broader interest rate environment and expectations for future economic conditions. For example, a narrowing term spread may suggest that investors expect stable or declining interest rates, which could signal a
slowing economy
. Conversely, a widening term spread might indicate expectations of rising rates and potential inflation.
Swap Spread and Yield Spread
Swap spreads are the differences between the fixed rate paid on an interest rate swap and the yield on a government bond of similar maturity. An interest rate swap involves exchanging a fixed interest rate for a floating rate based on an underlying benchmark, such as
SOFR
. The swap spread reflects the additional yield investors require for taking on the credit risk.
Swap spreads are related to yield spreads. While yield spreads focus on the difference between bonds with different credit qualities or sectors, swap spreads specifically measure the difference between swap rates and government bond yields. This difference reflects the additional yield investors demand for the risk associated with the swap for things like credit risk and liquidity.
Similar to a term spread, there are patterns that investors can look for to signal certain information from a swap spread. A widening swap spread may indicate increased credit risk or concerns about liquidity in the swap market, while a narrowing spread could suggest lower perceived risk or improved market conditions. Understanding swap spreads in conjunction with other yield spreads can enhance an investor's ability to navigate the complexities of interest",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldspread.asp
Investopedia,Licensed International Financial Analyst (LIFA): Overview,"Close
What Is a Licensed International Financial Analyst (LIFA)?
The Licensed International Financial Analyst (LIFA) is a global professional credential for investment professionals offered by The International Research Association. The LIFA designation helps candidates attain higher levels of professionalism and ethics in the profession of investment management and analysis. Exams require in-depth knowledge of investment principles, along with an understanding of global
capital markets
. The program involves passing three exams before a candidate can receive their designation.
Key Takeaways
The Licensed International Financial Analyst exam is a comprehensive credential earned by financial professionals worldwide.
The LIFA program is administered and offered by the International Research Association.
Unlike other globally recognized financial credentialing programs, the LIFA involves no enrollment fee and, you pay only if you pass the program and earn the LIFA charter.
The LIFA was established to challenge the dominance of the CFA charter, billing itself as a more intensive, more difficult to pass, and lower-cost option.
Understanding the Licensed International Financial Analyst (LIFA) Designation
The International Research Association is an organization that is committed to providing investment professionals with a way to work and compete in the financial marketplace. The IRA does this by offering the Licensed International Financial Analyst
designation
. The IRA began developing the program in 1999 and is ""recognized by the highest professional and ethical standards.""
1
Like the
Chartered Financial Analyst
(CFA), the LIFA designation requires candidates to pass three proctored examinations. Subject areas covered by the tests include asset valuation, corporate finance, derivatives, economics, financial statement analysis, ethics,
portfolio management
, international markets, and quantitative analysis.
1
Billed as the toughest exam in finance, the LIFA program was created to be a direct competitor to the CFA charter. There is no cost to register for the program or to take the three exams. In fact, candidates only pay if they pass.
2
The IRA attempts to keep the pass rate at an acceptable (or lower) level, believing that the validity of the designation is based on pass rates, and thus the quality of the designees: lower pass rates equal a more valuable designation. The pass rates on the LIFA are also lower than the notoriously difficult set of CFA examinations, with LIFA claiming average historical pass rates on:
Level I: 27%
Level II: 32%
Level III: 48%
2
Important
The cost per LIFA exam is $750.
2
Special Considerations
Unlike other programs like the CFA, which allows for those who fail to retake a test an unlimited number of times, the LIFA has a strict limit of only four attempts per exam level. Once the LIFA designation has been earned, members must pay annual dues of $275 to maintain their membership and credentials.
2
It costs $299 for an annual membership with the CFA Institute.

Investopedia,How Investment Risk Is Quantified,"Close
While diversification and asset allocation can improve returns, systematic and unsystematic risks are inherent in investing. However, along with the efficient frontier, statistical measures and methods, including
value at risk (VaR)
and capital asset pricing model (
CAPM
) are useful ways to measure risk. Understanding these tools can help an investor differentiate high-risk investments from stable ones.
Modern Portfolio and Efficient Frontier
Investing in financial markets can carry significant risks.
Modern portfolio theory
(MPT) assesses the maximum expected portfolio return for a given amount of portfolio risk. Within the framework of MPT, an optimal portfolio is constructed on the basis of
asset allocation
, diversification, and rebalancing. Asset allocation, together with diversification, is the strategy of dividing a portfolio among various asset classes. Optimal diversification involves holding multiple instruments that aren't positively correlated.
Key Takeaways
Investors can use models to help differentiate between risky investments and stable ones.
Modern portfolio theory is used to understand the risk of a portfolio relative to its return.
Diversification can reduce risk and optimal diversification is accomplished by building a portfolio of uncorrelated assets.
Efficient frontier is a set of portfolios that are optimized in terms of asset allocation and diversification.
Beta, standard deviations, and VaR measure risk, but in different ways.
Alpha and Beta Ratios
When it comes to quantifying value and risk, two statistical metrics
—
alpha
and
beta
—
are useful for investors. Both are risk ratios used in MPT and help to determine the risk/reward profile of investment securities.
Alpha measures the performance of an
investment portfolio
and compares it to a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. The difference between the returns of a portfolio and the
benchmark
is referred to as alpha. A positive alpha of one means the portfolio has outperformed the benchmark by 1%. Likewise, a negative alpha indicates the underperformance of an investment.
Beta measures the volatility of a portfolio compared to a benchmark index. The statistical measure beta is used in the CAPM, which uses risk and return to price an asset. Unlike alpha, beta captures the movements and swings in asset prices. A beta greater than one indicates higher volatility, whereas a beta under one means the security will be more stable.
For example, Amazon (
AMZN
), with a beta coefficient (5Y monthly) of 1.15 as of Oct. 2024,
1
represents a less risky investment than Carnival Corp (
CCL
), which has a beta of 2.69.
2
A savvy financial advisor or fund manager would likely avoid high alpha and beta investments for risk-averse clients.
Capital Asset Pricing Model
CAPM is an
equilibrium
theory built on the relationship between risk and expected return. The theory helps investors measure the risk and the expected return of an investment to price the asset appropriately. In particular, investors must be compensated for the time value of money and risk. The
risk-free rate
is used to represent the time value of money for placing money in any investment.
Simply put, the mean return of an asset should be linearly related to its beta coefficient—this shows that riskier investments earn a premium over the benchmark rate. Following a risk-to-reward framework, the expected return (under a CAPM model) will be higher when the investor bears greater risks.
R-Squared
In statistics,
R-squared
represents a notable component of regression analysis. The coefficient R represents the correlation between two variables—for investment purposes, R-squared measures the explained movement of a fund or security in relation to a benchmark. A high R-squared shows that a portfolio’s performance is in line with the index. Financial advisors can use R-squared in tandem with the beta to provide investors with a comprehensive picture of asset performance.
Standard Deviation
By definition, the standard deviation is a statistic used to quantify any variation from the average return of a data set. In finance,
standard deviation
uses the return of an investment to measure the investment’s volatility. The measure differs slightly from beta because it compares volatility to the historical returns of the security rather than a benchmark index. High standard deviations are indicative of volatility, while lower standard deviations are associated with stable assets.
The Sharpe Ratio
One of the most popular tools in financial analysis, the
Sharpe ratio
is a measurement of the expected excess return of an investment in relation to its volatility. The Sharpe ratio measures the average return in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of uncertainty to determine how much additional return an investor can receive with the added
volatility
of holding riskier assets. A Sharpe ratio of one or greater is considered to have a better risk-to-reward tradeoff.
Efficient Frontiers
The
efficient frontier
, which is a set of ideal portfolios, does its best to minimize an investor’s exposure to such risk. Introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952, the concept identifies an optimal level of diversification and asset allocation given the
intrinsic risks of a portfolio
.
3
Efficient frontiers are derived from
mean-variance analysis
, which attempts to create more efficient investment choices. The typical investor prefers high expected returns with low
variance
. The efficient frontier is constructed accordingly by using a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a specific risk level.
Important
Risk and volatility are not the same thing. Volatility refers to the speed of price movement of the investment and risk is the amount of money that can be lost on an investment.
Value at Risk
The value at risk (VaR) approach to portfolio management is a simple way to measure risk. VaR measures the maximum loss that cannot be exceeded at a given confidence level. Calculated based on time period, confidence level, and predetermined loss amount, VaR statistics provide investors with a worst-case scenario analysis.
If an investment has a 5% VaR, the investor faces a 5% chance of losing the entire investment in any given month. The VaR methodology isn’t the most comprehensive measure of risk, but it remains one of the most popular measures in portfolio management due to its simplistic approach.
The Bottom Line
Investing in financial markets is inherently risky, but some investments are
riskier than others
. Many individuals use financial advisors and
wealth managers
to increase returns and reduce the risk of investments. These financial professionals use statistical measures and risk/reward models to differentiate volatile assets from stable ones. Modern portfolio theory uses five statistical indicators—alpha, beta, standard deviation, R-squared, and the Sharpe ratio—to do this. Likewise, the capital asset pricing model and value at risk are widely employed to measure the risk to reward tradeoff with assets and portfolios.

Definition
The debt ratio, or debt-to-assets ratio is a leverage ratio that defines how much debt a company carries compared to the value of the assets it owns.
What Is the Total Debt-to-Total Assets Ratio?
The debt ratio, or total debt-to-total assets, is calculated by dividing a company's total debt by its total assets. It is also called the debt-to-assets ratio. It is a
leverage ratio
that defines how much debt a company carries compared to the value of the
assets
it owns.
Using this metric, analysts can compare one company's leverage with that of other companies in the same industry. This information can reflect how financially stable a company is. The higher the ratio, the higher the degree of leverage (DoL). Depending on averages for the industry, there could be a higher risk of investing in that company compared to another.
Key Takeaways
The total debt-to-total assets ratio is calculated by dividing a company's total debt by its total assets.
This ratio shows the degree to which a company has used debt to finance its assets.
The calculation considers all of the company's debt, not just loans and bonds payable, and all assets, including intangibles.
If a company has a total debt-to-total assets ratio of 0.4, 40% of its assets are financed by creditors, and 60% are financed by owners' (shareholders') equity.
The ratio does not inform users of the composition of assets nor how a single company's ratio may compare to others in the same industry.
A lower ratio suggests that a company is less reliant on debt and is more financially stable.

Formula and Calculation of the Total Debt-to-Total Assets Ratio
The total debt-to-total assets formula is the quotient of total debt divided by total assets. As shown below, total debt includes both short-term and long-term liabilities.
TD/TA
=
Short-Term Debt
+
Long-Term Debt
Total Assets
\begin{aligned} &\text{TD/TA} = \frac{ \text{Short-Term Debt} + \text{Long-Term Debt} }{ \text{Total Assets} } \\ \end{aligned}
​
TD/TA
=
Total Assets
Short-Term Debt
+
Long-Term Debt
​
​
This calculation generally results in ratios of less than 1.0 (100%).
Total debt-to-total assets is a measure of the company's assets that are financed by debt rather than equity.
If the calculation yields a result greater than 1, this means the company is technically insolvent as it has more liabilities than all of its assets combined. A result of 0.5 (or 50%) means that 50% of the company's assets are financed using debt (with the other half being financed through equity).
What the Total Debt-to-Total Assets Ratio Can Tell You
The total debt-to-total assets ratio analyzes a company's
balance sheet
. The calculation includes long-term and short-term debt (borrowings maturing within one year) of the company. It also encompasses all assets—both tangible and intangible.
It indicates how much debt is used to carry a firm's assets, and how those assets might be used to service that debt. Therefore, it measures a firm's
degree of leverage
.

Debt servicing payments must be made under all circumstances, otherwise, the company would breach its
debt covenants
and run the risk of being forced into bankruptcy by creditors. While other liabilities, such as accounts payable and long-term leases, can be negotiated to some extent, there is very little “wiggle room” with debt covenants.
A company with a high degree of leverage may thus find it more difficult to stay afloat during a recession than one with low leverage.
Leverage Trends
When calculated over several years, this leverage ratio can show a company's use of leverage as a function of time. For example, a ratio that drops 0.1% every year for 10 years would show that as a company ages, it reduces its use of leverage.
Ability to Meet Debts
Investors use the ratio to evaluate whether the company has enough funds to meet its current debt obligations and to assess whether it can pay a return on its investment.
Creditors
use the ratio to see how much debt the company already has and whether the company can repay its existing debts. This will determine whether additional loans will be extended to the firm.
Important
A total debt-to-total asset ratio greater than one means that if the company were to cease operating, not all debtors would receive payment on their holdings.
Example of How to Use the Total Debt-to-Total Assets Ratio
Let's examine the total debt-to-total assets ratio for three companies:
Debt to Assets Comparison
(Data in millions)
ABC
DEF
XYZ
Total Debt
$107,633
$31,845
$18,239
Total Assets
$359,268
$63,852
$20,941
Total Debt to Assets
0.30
0.50
0.87
Debt to Assets Comparison
Here's what each company's ratio can tell you about it:
ABC is not weighed down by debt obligations and will likely be able to secure additional capital at potentially lower rates compared to the other two companies. Although its debt balance is more than three times higher than DEF, it carries proportionally less debt to total assets compared to the other two companies.
DEF has been financed nearly evenly split between debt and equity. This means the company carries roughly the same amount of debt as it does in
retained earnings
, common stock, and net income.
XYZ is known for carrying a high degree of debt on its balance sheet. Although its debt balance is smaller than the other two companies, almost 90% of all the assets it owns are financed. XYZ has the lowest degree of flexibility of these three companies as it has legal obligations to fulfill (whereas ABC has flexibility regarding dividend distributions to shareholders).
It's also important to understand the size, industry, and goals of each company to interpret their total debt-to-total assets. ABC is no longer a
start-up
, for example; it is an established company with proven revenue models that make it easier to attract investors.
Meanwhile, XYZ is a much smaller company that may not be as enticing to shareholders. XYZ may find investor demands are too great to secure financing, turning to financial institutions for capital instead.
Fast Fact
Total debt-to-total assets may be reported as a decimal or a percentage. For example, ABC's .30 total debt-to-total assets may also be communicated as 30%. This means that 30% of ABC's assets are financed through debt.
Limitations of Using the Total Debt-to-Total Assets Ratio
One shortcoming of the total debt-to-total assets ratio is that it does not provide any indication of asset quality since it lumps all tangible and
intangible assets
together.
For example, in the example above, say XYZ reported $2.9 billion in intangible assets, $1.3 billion in PPE, and $1.04 billion in goodwill as part of its total $20.9 billion of assets. Therefore, the company had more debt ($18.2 billion) on its books than all of its $15.7 billion current assets (assets that can be quickly converted to cash).
Should all of its debts be called immediately by lenders, the company would be unable to pay all its debt, even if the total debt-to-total assets ratio indicates it might be able to.
As with all other ratios, the trend of the total debt-to-total assets ratio should be
evaluated over time
. This will help assess whether the company’s financial risk profile is improving or deteriorating. For example, a trend of increasing leverage use might indicate that a business is unwilling or unable to pay down its debt, which could signify issues in the future.
What Is a Good Total Debt-to-Total Assets Ratio?
A company's total debt-to-total assets ratio is specific to that company's size, industry, sector, and capitalization strategy. For example, start-up tech companies are often more reliant on private investors and will have lower total-debt-to-total-asset calculations. However, more secure, stable companies may find it easier to secure loans from banks and have higher ratios. In general, a ratio around 0.3 to 0.6 is where many investors will feel comfortable, though a company's specific situation may yield different results.
Is a Low Total Debt-to-Total Asset Ratio Good?
A low total debt-to-total-asset ratio isn't necessarily good or bad. It simply means that the company has decided to prioritize raising money by issuing stock to investors instead of taking out loans at a bank. While a lower calculation means a company avoids paying as much interest, it also means",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebttototalassets.asp
Investopedia,Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return: Overview,"Close
What Was Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return?
Form 1040-A of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was a simplified version of Form 1040 used by U.S. taxpayers to file an annual income tax return. To have been eligible to use Form 1040-A, an individual needed to meet certain requirements such as not itemizing deductions, not owning a business, and having a taxable income of less than $100,000. Unofficially known as the ""short form,"" Form 1040-A was eliminated for the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040 that debuted that year.
1
Key Takeaways
Form 1040-A was a simplified version of Form 1040 used for filing individual income tax.
Filers using 1040-A were required to have less than $100,000 in taxable income and not have exercised any incentive stock options during the year.
The IRS eliminated Form 1040-A for the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040.
Another variant of Form 1040 was Form 1040-EZ, which was even simpler than Form 1040-A and was also eliminated starting with the 2018 tax filing.
Who Had to File Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return?
Most U.S. taxpayers use IRS
Form 1040
to file their
income tax returns
. Form 1040 is a detailed form that offers taxpayers with complex investments,
itemized deductions
, multiple
tax credits
, and more than $100,000 in annual income more opportunities to lower their tax liability. Because additional paperwork is usually required with Form 1040, individuals with simpler tax situations previously had the option to use Form 1040-A instead.
2
﻿
Form 1040-A was a simplified version of Form 1040. The two-page form allowed taxpayers to report ordinary income, some deductions, and credits. Individuals who fell under any of the five status options—single, head of household, married filing separately, married filing jointly, or widowed—could file their tax returns using the 1040-A. Though Form 1040-A was available to taxpayers of any age and filing status, not everyone qualified to use this form.
3
﻿
Tax filers who used 1040-A must have earned less than $100,000 taxable income and not have exercised any
incentive stock options
(ISO) during the tax year. The income reported must have been earned as a wage, salary, tip, capital gain, dividend, interest income, unemployment compensation, pension, annuity, taxable Social Security and railroad retirement benefit, taxable scholarship or grant, and
Alaska Permanent Fund
dividend. Any other form of income, such as business income, needed to be reported on the more complex Form 1040.
1
﻿
How Did Form 1040-A Work?
Form 1040-A also gave taxpayers the opportunity to claim several tax deductions to reduce their
taxable income
. However, the only deductions they could claim included student loan interest, post-secondary tuition and fees, classroom expenses, and individual retirement account (IRA) contributions. Taxpayers using Form 1040-A could not claim itemized deductions. This limitation meant that if an individual qualified for other deductions from sources such as
charitable donations
or
mortgage interest
, and the total itemized deductible amount was more than the standard deductions, it would not have been advantageous for them to use 1040-A.
1
Form 1040-A also could be used to claim tax credits. Tax credits reduce the bottom line or total tax bill of a taxpayer. The credits that could be claimed using this form were the
American Opportunity Tax Credit
(AOTC),
Earned Income Credit
(EITC), child tax and
additional child tax credit
,
child and dependent care credit
, credits for the elderly or disabled, and
retirement savings contribution credit
.
3
Form 1040-A vs. Form 1040-EZ
Another variant of Form 1040 was
Form 1040-EZ
, which was even simpler and easier to fill out than Form 1040-A and was also eliminated starting with the 2018 tax filing. But with Form 1040-EZ, the individual had to file as either a single taxpayer or as married filing jointly; they could not claim deductions and could only claim the EIC.
4
﻿
Although Form 1040-A was slightly more complex than Form 1040-EZ, it was still relatively simple compared to 1040. Once their financial situation became complicated with dependents, special deductions, and credits—such as those associated with post-secondary education tuition—most taxpayers needed to switch from filing with the 1040-EZ to the 1040-A.
The redesigned Form 1040 that debuted with the 2018 tax year is designed to be much simpler to use than its predecessor. For this reason, the IRS eliminated both Form 1040-A and Form 1040-EZ.

Definition
Regression tries to determine how a dependent variable and one or more other (independent) variables relate to each other. It’s a statistical method.
What Is Regression?
Regression is a statistical method that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps predict or understand how changes in the independent variable(s) are associated with changes in the dependent variable.
Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. It establishes the
linear relationship
between two variables and is also referred to as simple regression or ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
Linear regression is graphically depicted using a straight
line of best fit
, with the slope defining how the change in one variable impacts a change in the other. The y-intercept of a linear regression relationship represents the value of the dependent variable when the value of the independent variable is zero.
Nonlinear regression
models also exist but are far more complex.
Key Takeaways
Regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables.
A regression model shows whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the independent variables.
It does this by determining a best-fit line to see how the data is dispersed around this line.
Regression helps economists and financial analysts with challenges ranging from asset valuation to making predictions.
Several assumptions about the data and the model itself must hold for regression results to be properly interpreted.
Regression is used in economics to help investment managers value assets and understand the relationships between factors such as
commodity
prices and the
stocks
of businesses dealing in those commodities. It’s a powerful tool for uncovering the associations between variables observed in data, but it can’t easily indicate causation.
Regression as a statistical technique shouldn’t be confused with the concept of regression to the mean, also known as
mean reversion
.

How Regression Works
Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a dataset and quantifies whether those correlations are
statistically significant
. The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and
multiple linear regression
, but there are nonlinear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis.
Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y. Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome. Analysts can use
stepwise regression
to examine each independent variable contained in the linear regression model.
Regression can help finance and investment professionals. A company might use it to predict sales based on weather, previous sales, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or other types of conditions. The
capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
is a regression model that’s often used in finance for pricing assets and discovering the costs of capital.
Regression and Econometrics
Econometrics
is a set of statistical techniques that are used to analyze data in finance and economics. It effectively studies the income effect using observable data. An economist might hypothesize that a consumer’s spending will increase as they increase their
income
.
A regression analysis can then be conducted to understand the strength of the relationship between income and consumption if the data show that such an association is present. It can indicate whether that relationship is statistically significant.
You can have several independent variables in an analysis, such as changes to GDP and inflation in addition to unemployment in explaining stock market prices. It’s referred to as multiple linear regression when more than one independent variable is used. This is the most commonly used tool in econometrics.
Important
Econometrics is sometimes criticized for relying too heavily on the interpretation of regression output without linking it to economic theory or looking for causal mechanisms. It’s crucial that the findings revealed in the data can be adequately explained by a theory.
Calculating Regression
Linear regression models often use a least-squares approach to determine the line of best fit. The least-squares technique is determined by minimizing the
sum of squares
created by a mathematical function. A square is then determined by squaring the distance between a data point and the regression line or mean value of the dataset.
A regression model is constructed when this process has been completed. It’s usually accomplished with software. The general form of each type of regression model is:

Example of Regression Analysis in Finance
Regression is often used to determine how specific factors such as the price of a commodity, interest rates, particular industries, or sectors influence the price movement of an asset. The CAPM is based on regression and is used to project the expected returns for stocks and generate costs of capital. A stock’s returns are regressed against the returns of a broader index such as the S&P 500 to generate a
beta
for the particular stock.
Beta is the stock’s risk in relation to the market or index, and it’s reflected as the slope in the CAPM. The return for the stock in question would be the dependent variable Y. The independent variable X would be the market risk premium.
Additional variables such as the market capitalization of a stock, valuation ratios, and recent returns can be added to the CAPM to get better estimates for returns. These additional factors are known as the Fama-French factors. They’re named after the professors who developed the multiple linear regression model to better explain asset returns.

Explain Like I’m 5 Years Old
Regression tries to see if there’s a relationship between two things, such as whether there’s a link between how you do one thing and how you do one or more other things.
Regression helps you make educated guesses, or predictions, based on past information. It’s about finding a pattern between two or more things and using that pattern to make a good guess about what might happen in the future.
Why Is This Method Called Regression?
There’s some debate about the origins of the name, but this statistical technique was most likely termed “regression” by Sir Francis Galton in the 19th century. It described the statistical feature of biological data, such as the heights of people in a population, to regress to a mean level. There are shorter and taller people, but only outliers are very tall or short, and most people cluster somewhere around or “regress” to the average.

What Is a Discount Rate?
The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges commercial banks and other financial institutions for short-term loans. The discount rate is applied at the Fed's lending facility, which is called the discount window.
A discount rate can also refer to the interest rate used in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. In this case, investors and businesses can use the discount rate for potential investments.
Key Takeaways
In banking, the discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges banks for short-term loans.
Discount lending is a key monetary policy tool and part of the Fed's function as the lender-of-last-resort.
In discounted cash flow analysis, the discount rate is the rate used to discount future cash flows.
The discount rate expresses the time value of money in DCF and can make the difference between whether an investment project is financially viable or not.
You can calculate the discount rate in DCF as long as you know the future and present values and the total number of years.
Fed's Discount Rate
How the Fed’s Discount Rate Works
Commercial banks in the U.S. have two primary ways to borrow money for their short-term operating needs. They can borrow and loan money to other banks without the need for any collateral using the market-driven
interbank rate
, or they can borrow money for their short-term operating requirements from the
Federal Reserve Bank
.
Federal Reserve loans are processed through the
12 regional branches of the Fed
. The loans are used by financial institutes to cover any cash shortfalls, head off any liquidity problems, or in the worst-case scenario, prevent the bank’s failure. This Fed-offered lending facility is known as the discount window.

The loans are incredibly short-term: 24 hours or less. The rate of interest charged is the standard
discount rate
. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve set this discount rate.

The 3 Tiers of the Fed’s Discount Window Loans
The Fed's discount window program runs three tiers of loans, each using a separate but related rate. It also allows for emergency credit approvals for banks in distress.
The Fed determines the discount rates for the first two tiers independently. The rate for the third tier is based on the prevailing rates in the market.
First Tier
: Called the primary credit program, this tier provides capital to financially sound banks with good credit records. This primary credit discount rate is usually set above existing market
interest rates
which may be available from other banks or other sources of similar short-term debt.
Second Tier
:
Called the secondary
credit
program, it offers similar loans to institutions that do not qualify for the primary rate. It is usually set 50 basis points higher than the primary rate (one percentage point = 100 basis points). Institutions in this tier are smaller and may not be as financially healthy as the ones that use the primary tier.
Third Tier
: Called the seasonal credit program, this one serves smaller
financial institutions
which experience higher seasonal variations in their
cash flows
. Many are regional banks that serve the needs of the agriculture and tourism sectors. Their businesses are considered relatively risky, so the interest rates they pay are higher.
Emergency Credit
: Banks applying for emergency credit must demonstrate proof that they cannot find a loan from another bank and requires a vote with the support of at least five members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
1
Important
All three types of the Federal Reserve's discount window loans are
collateralized
​. The bank needs to maintain a certain level of security or collateral against the loan. Emergency credit may require collateral, but it's based on circumstances and the Fed's vote.
Use of the Fed’s Discount Rate
Borrowing institutions use this facility sparingly, mostly when they cannot find willing
lenders
in the marketplace. The Fed-offered discount rates are available at relatively high-interest rates compared to the interbank borrowing rates to discourage using the discount window too often.
The discount window is primarily intended as an emergency option for distressed banks—borrowing from it can even signal weakness to other market participants and investors.
Example of Fed Discount Rate
The use of the Fed's discount window soared in late 2007 and 2008 as financial conditions deteriorated sharply and the
central bank
took steps to inject
liquidity
into the financial system.
In August 2007, the Board of Governors cut the primary discount rate from 6.25% to 5.75%, reducing the premium over the
Fed funds rate
from 1% to 0.5%. In October 2008, the month after
Lehman Brothers' collapse
, discount window borrowing peaked at $403.5 billion against the monthly average of $0.7 billion from 1959 to 2006.
Owing to the
financial crisis
, the board extended the lending period from overnight to 30 days, then to 90 days in March 2008.
2
Once the economy recovered, those temporary measures were revoked, and the discount rate was reverted to overnight lending only.
The Fed maintains its own discount rate under the discount window program in the U.S. Most central banks across the globe use similar measures, although they vary by area. For instance, the
European Central Bank (ECB)
offers standing facilities that serve the same purpose. Financial organizations can obtain overnight liquidity from the central bank against the presentation of sufficient eligible assets as collateral.
3
Fast Fact
Most commonly, the Fed's discount window loans are overnight only, but the loan period can be extended in periods of extreme economic distress, such as the 2008-2009 credit crisis.
How the Discount Rate Works in Cash Flow Analysis
The same term, discount rate, is used in discounted cash flow analysis. DCF is used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. Based on the concept of the
time value of money
, DCF analysis helps assess the viability of a project or investment by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows
using a discount rate
.
Such an analysis begins with an estimate of the investment that a proposed project will require. Then, the future
returns
it is expected to generate are considered. Using the discount rate, it is possible to calculate the current value of any future cash flows. The project is considered viable if the net
present value (PV)
is positive. If it is negative, the project isn't worth the investment.
In this context of DCF analysis, the discount rate refers to the interest rate used to determine the present value. For example, $100 invested today in a savings scheme with a 10% interest rate will grow to $110. In other words, $110, which is the
future value (FV)
, when discounted by the rate of 10%, is worth $100 (present value) as of today.
If one knows (or can reasonably predict) all such future cash flows (like the future value of $110), then, using a particular discount rate, the present value of such an investment can be obtained.
Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi
What Is the Right Discount Rate to Use?
What is the appropriate discount rate to use for an investment or a business project? While investing in standard assets, like treasury bonds, the
risk-free rate
of return—generally considered the interest rate on the three-month Treasury bill—is often used as the discount rate.
On the other hand, if a business is assessing the viability of a potential project, the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
may be used as a discount rate. This is the average cost the company pays for capital from borrowing or selling equity.
In either case, the net present value of all cash flows should be positive if the investment or project is to get the green light.
Types of Discounted Cash Flow
There are different types of discount rates that apply to various investments of a business. What type is required depends on the needs and demands of investors and the company itself. Here are the most common:

Definition
Monetary policy is the combination of strategy and actions that the Federal Reserve employs to achieve the economic goals set for it by Congress.
What Is Monetary Policy?
Monetary policy is a set of tools used by a nation's
central bank
to control the overall money supply and promote economic growth.
It involves strategies such as adjusting interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.
In the United States, the
Federal Reserve Bank (Fed)
implements monetary policy to respond to a dual mandate from Congress to achieve maximum employment while keeping inflation in check.
1
Key Takeaways
Monetary policy controls a nation's overall money supply for the purpose of economic growth.
Monetary policy strategies include revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.
It is commonly classified as either expansionary or contractionary.
The Fed commonly uses three tools to implement its monetary policy: reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations.
Xiaojie Liu / Investopedia
Understanding Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is the control of the quantity of money available in an
economy
and the channels by which new money is supplied.
Economic statistics such as
gross domestic product (GDP)
, the rate of
inflation
, and industry and sector-specific growth rates influence monetary policy strategy.

A central bank may revise the interest rates it charges to loan money to the nation's banks. As these rates rise or fall, financial institutions adjust their rates for their customers, such as businesses or home buyers.
This can slow or encourage borrowing, spending, business activity, hiring, and economic growth. It can also affect the rate of inflation.
Additionally, a central bank may buy or sell government bonds, target
foreign exchange
rates, and revise the amount of cash that the banks are required to maintain as reserves.
Important
The Federal Reserve commonly uses three tools for monetary policy: reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations.
Types of Monetary Policy
Monetary policies are seen as either expansionary or contractionary depending on the level of growth or stagnation within the economy.
Contractionary
A
contractionary
policy increases interest rates and limits the outstanding money supply to slow growth and decrease inflation, where the prices of goods and services in an economy rise and reduce the purchasing power of money.
2
Expansionary
During times of slowdown or a
recession
, an
expansionary
policy supports economic activity. By lowering interest rates, saving becomes less attractive, business and consumer borrowing increases, as does business and
consumer spending
.
1
Goals of Monetary Policy
Inflation
Contractionary monetary policy is used to temper inflation by reducing the level of money circulating in the economy. Expansionary monetary policy increases the amount of money in circulation and fosters inflationary pressure due to greater economic activity.
Unemployment
An expansionary monetary policy decreases unemployment as a larger money supply and attractive interest rates stimulate business activities and expansion of the job market.
Exchange Rates
The exchange rates between domestic and foreign currencies can be affected by monetary policy. With an increase in the money supply, the domestic currency can become less attractive and cheaper relative to other currencies.
Tools of Monetary Policy
Open Market Operations
In
open market operations (OMO)
, the Fed buys bonds from investors or sells additional bonds to them to increase or reduce the money available to the economy as a whole.
3
The objective of OMOs is to adjust the level of reserve balances to manipulate the short-term interest rates that affect other interest rates.
3
Interest Rates
The central bank may change interest rates or the required
collateral
that it demands. In the U.S., this rate is known as the
discount rate
.
4
It's the rate that the Fed charges financial institutions for loans it makes to them.
The level of the discount rate can affect other interest rates, such as those that banks charge customers. Banks will loan more or less freely depending on the discount rate.
Reserve Requirements
A central bank can manipulate the
reserve requirements
, which govern the funds that banks must retain as a proportion of the deposits made by their customers to ensure that they can meet their
liabilities
.
5
Lowering this reserve requirement releases more capital for the banks to offer as loans or with which to buy other assets. Increasing the requirement curtails bank lending and slows growth.
Monetary Policy vs. Fiscal Policy
Monetary policy is enacted by a central bank to sustain a level economy and keep unemployment low. It is intended to protect the value of the currency and maintain economic activity.
By manipulating interest rates or reserve requirements, or through open market operations, a central bank affects borrowing, spending, and savings rates.
Fiscal policy
is an additional tool used by governments but not central banks. While the Federal Reserve can influence the economy through the money supply, and
impact market sentiment
, the U.S. Treasury Department can create new money and implement new tax policies.
6
In other words, fiscal policy involves government spending and taxing. It spends to add money, directly or indirectly, into the economy to increase business and consumer spending and spur growth.
7
Both monetary and fiscal policies were used in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
8
How Often Does Monetary Policy Change?
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve meets eight times a year to determine any changes to the nation's monetary policies.
9
The Federal Reserve may also act in an emergency, as during the 2007-2008 economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
How Has Monetary Policy Been Used to Curb Inflation In the United States?
A contractionary policy can slow economic growth and even increase unemployment but is often seen as necessary to level the economy and keep inflation in check. During double-digit inflation in the 1980s, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to 20%.
10
Though the effect of high rates spurred a recession, inflation was reduced to a range of 3% to 4% over the following years.
11
Why Is the Federal Reserve Called a Lender of Last Resort?
The Fed also serves the role of
lender of last resort
, providing banks with
liquidity
and maintaining regulatory scrutiny to prevent them from failing and causing financial panic.
12
The Bottom Line
Monetary policy employs strategies and tools to keep a nation's economy stable
while limiting inflation
and unemployment.
Expansionary monetary policy stimulates a weakening economy and contractionary monetary policy slows down an inflationary economy. A nation's monetary policy is often coordinated with its fiscal policy.

Definition
The International Monetary Fund is an international organization that promotes global economic growth, financial stability, and international trade. It aims to reduce poverty.
What Is the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization that promotes global
economic growth
and financial stability, encourages international trade, and reduces poverty.
Quotas of member countries are a key determinant of the voting power in IMF decisions. Votes comprise one vote per 100,000
special drawing rights
(SDR) of quota plus basic votes. SDRs are an international type of
monetary reserve
currency created by the IMF as a supplement to the existing money reserves of member countries.
Key Takeaways
The IMF's mission is to promote global economic growth and financial stability, encourage international trade, and reduce poverty around the world.
The IMF was originally created in 1945 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement, which attempted to encourage international financial cooperation by introducing a system of convertible currencies at fixed exchange rates.
1
The IMF collects massive amounts of data on national economies, international trade, and the global economy in aggregate and provides economic forecasts.
One of the IMF's most important functions is to make loans to countries that are experiencing economic distress to prevent or mitigate financial crises.
Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu
Understanding the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is based in Washington, D.C. The organization is currently composed of 191 member countries, each of which has representation on the IMF's executive board in proportion to its financial importance. Quotas are a key determinant of the voting power in IMF decisions. Votes comprise one vote per SDR100,000 of quota plus basic votes (same for all members).
2
3
The IMF's website describes its mission as ""to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.""
2
History of the IMF
The IMF was originally created in 1945 as part of the
Bretton Woods Agreement
, which attempted to encourage international financial cooperation by introducing a system of convertible currencies at
fixed exchange rates
. The dollar was redeemable for gold at $35 per ounce at the time.
1
The IMF also acted as a gatekeeper: Countries were not eligible for membership in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)—a
World Bank
forerunner that the Bretton Woods agreement created in order to fund the reconstruction of Europe after World War II—unless they were members of the IMF.
4
5
Since the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the 1970s, the IMF has promoted the system of
floating exchange rates
, meaning that market forces determine the value of currencies relative to one another. This system remains in place today.
6
IMF Activities
The IMF's primary methods for achieving these goals are monitoring capacity building and lending.
Important
The reports the IMF publishes on its monetary surveillance include the ""World Economic Outlook,"" the ""Global Financial Stability Report,"" and the ""Fiscal Monitor.""
Surveillance
The IMF collects massive amounts of data on national economies,
international trade
, and the global economy in aggregate. The organization also provides regularly updated economic forecasts at the national and international levels. These forecasts, published in the World Economic Outlook, are accompanied by lengthy discussions on the effect of fiscal, monetary, and trade policies on growth prospects and financial stability.
Capacity Building
The IMF provides technical assistance, training, and policy advice to member countries through its capacity-building programs. These programs include training in data collection and analysis, which feed into the IMF's project of monitoring national and global economies.
7
Lending
The IMF makes
loans
to countries that are experiencing economic distress to prevent or mitigate financial crises. Members contribute the funds for this lending to a pool based on a quota system. For example, in 2019, loan resources in the amount of SDR 11.4 billion (SDR 0.4 billion above target) were secured to support the IMF’s concessional lending activities into the next decade.
8
IMF funds are often conditional on recipients making reforms to increase their growth potential and financial stability.
Structural adjustment
programs, as these conditional loans are known, have attracted criticism for exacerbating poverty and reproducing colonialist structures.
9
Where Does the IMF Get Its Money?
The IMF gets its money through quotas and subscriptions from its member countries. These contributions are based on the size of the country's economy, making the U.S., with the world's largest economy, the largest contributor.
How Much Are the IMF Grants?
IMF grants are given to charities in Washington, D.C., and member countries. The grants are meant to foster economic independence through education and economic development. The average grant size is $15,000.
10
What Is the Difference Between the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank?
The International Monetary Fund is primarily focused on the stability of the global monetary system and monitoring the currencies of the world. The aim of the World Bank is to reduce poverty across the world and strengthen the low- to middle-class populations.
The Bottom Line
The IMF
works to help reduce poverty
, encourage trade, and promote financial stability and economic growth around the world. It accomplishes this by monitoring capacity building and providing loans. While the IMF is currently working on these goals with its 191 member nations, the organization has still faced criticism for the possible negative impacts of its structural adjustment programs.

Investopedia,ADP National Employment Report: Definition and What It Covers,"Close
What Is the ADP National Employment Report?
The ADP National Employment Report is a monthly report of economic data that tracks the level of
nonfarm
private employment in the U.S. It is published by Automatic Data Processing. The ADP National Employment Report is also known as the ADP Jobs Report or the ADP Employment Report.
Key Takeaways
The ADP National Employment Report is a monthly report of economic data that tracks nonfarm private employment in the U.S.
The ADP Employment Report provides historical data from 2010.
Automatic Data Processing Inc., the company that issues the report, handles payroll for about one-fifth of all privately-employed individuals in the U.S.
The ADP National Employment Report is viewed as a useful preview of the more detailed Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report.
The ADP National Employment Report is divided into four separate releases.
Understanding the ADP National Employment Report
If you're not
self-employed
or a government employee, there is a decent chance that your pay statement is processed by Automatic Data Processing Inc. (
ADP
). The firm handles payroll for about a fifth of U.S. private employment, putting it in a unique position to survey trends in the nation’s
labor market
.
1
ADP collects data through the payroll services and benefits administration it provides to companies. It issues reports on its findings through a partnership with Stanford Digital Economy Lab.
2
The ADP National Employment Report is released two days prior to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics'
employment situation
report
, which is available on the first Friday of each month. Investors and economists see the ADP report as a preview of the more detailed and comprehensive government data release.
3
4
Details of the ADP National Employment Report
The methodology of the ADP
National Employment Report is managed by Stanford Digital Economy Lab using figures that are
seasonally adjusted
.
The report has two main sections: ""Change in U.S. Private Employment"" and ""Pay Insights."" Both of these sections are broken down as follows:
Change in U.S. Private Employment:
This section provides an overall national number, then it breaks down the numbers by industry (goods-producing and service-providing), region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), and establishment size (small, medium, and large). All of these categories are broken down even further: industry by type, regions by smaller regions, and establishment size by the number of employees.
5
Pay Insights:
This section provides an overall median change in annual pay (job-stayers and job-changers). It then breaks the numbers down by industry sector (goods-producing and service-providing) and firm size (small, medium, and large). These are also broken down further as detailed above.
The Monthly ADP National Employment Report
In April 2024, private-sector employment increased by 192,000 jobs. According to the ADP report, the average pace of hiring has grown over the past three months after a slowdown at the end of last year.
2
The report states that hiring was broad-based in the month with only the information sector, which includes media, telecommunications, and information technology, exhibiting weakness. This sector posted job losses and the smallest pace of growth in pay since August 2021.
2
Note
The ADP report is published by a private company, not a government agency. But historically, its figures tend to align closely with the official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Special Considerations
The number of people that are employed can tell us a lot about the state of the economy. Total employment and the rate of unemployment are used to determine when the economy is in a recession. The chart below illustrates the monthly changes in nonfarm private employment data since 2002. As you can see, the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with a dramatic rise in
unemployment
.
A population that is fully employed and where many people are earning steady paychecks is synonymous with a strong economy. More real goods and services are being produced and, in turn, people are earning the income to buy them. More money is circulating, which triggers an increase in demand for goods and services, plus more job opportunities for people to help manufacture and sell them.
Eventually, demand for labor can outstrip supply. When this occurs, employees have greater bargaining power and can demand better wages, which can lead to falling corporate profits, higher inflation, and pressure to raise interest rates.
When Is the ADP National Employment Report Released?
The ADP National Employment Report is usually published two days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes its monthly employment report, which is issued on the first Friday of every month. Since the ADP report comes first, it is often used as a preview of the more thorough statistics from the government agency.
3
4
How Is the ADP Employment Report Different From the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report?
The main difference between the ADP Employment Report and the official BLS report is that ADP only covers non-farm, private employees. As a government body, the BLS survey also includes government employees. In addition, while the ADP only releases one set of numbers, the BLS report is updated to include companies that send in their survey responses after their report is published. Both reports have very similar methodologies and tend to yield very similar results.
6
7
Why Does the ADP Employment Report Have Higher Numbers Than the BLS Report?
Beginning in 2017, economists began observing significant divergences between the ADP and BLS figures on national employment, with the ADP estimates consistently higher than government figures. This is likely due to subtle differences in methodology and sampling between the two bodies. ADP's data is based on the payrolls of their client companies, meaning that their figures must be adjusted to reflect national economic data.
8
6
The Bottom Line
The ADP National Employment Report provides monthly insight into the nonfarm payroll activity in the United States. The report is helpful in gauging different facets of the U.S. economy and is useful to investors and policy-makers alike.

Brexit is a portmanteau of the words “British” and “exit” that was coined to refer to the United Kingdom’s decision in a June 23, 2016, referendum to leave the
European Union (EU)
. Brexit took place at 11 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Jan. 31, 2020.
1
On Dec. 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU struck a provisional free-trade agreement ensuring the free trade of goods without tariffs or quotas. However, key details of the future relationship remain uncertain, such as trade in services, which make up 80% of the U.K. economy. This prevented a no-deal Brexit, which would have been significantly damaging to the U.K. economy.
A provisional agreement was approved by the U.K. parliament on Jan. 1, 2021. It was approved by the European Parliament on April 28, 2021. While the deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), allowed tariff- and quota-free trade in goods, U.K.-EU trade still faces customs checks. This means that commerce is not as smooth as when the U.K. was a member of the EU.

Key Takeaways
Brexit refers to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (EU).
Brexit took place on Jan. 31, 2020, following the June 2016 referendum in the country.
The Leave side received 51.9% of the vote while the Remain side got 48.1%.
Negotiations took place between the U.K. and the EU from 2017 to 2019 on the terms of a divorce deal.
There was a transition period following Brexit that expired on Dec. 31, 2020.

The Referendum
The Leave side won the June 2016 referendum with 51.9% of the ballot, or 17.4 million votes, while Remain received 48.1% or 16.1 million votes. Voter turnout was 72.2%. The results were tallied on a U.K.-wide basis, but the overall figures conceal stark regional differences: 53.4% of English voters supported Brexit, compared to just 38% of Scottish voters.
4
Because England accounts for the vast majority of the U.K.’s population, support there swayed the result in Brexit’s favor. If the vote were conducted only in Wales (where Leave voters also won), Scotland, and Northern Ireland, Brexit would have received less than 45% of the vote.

The result defied expectations and roiled global markets, causing the
British pound
to fall to its lowest level against the dollar in 30 years.
6
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the referendum and campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the EU, announced his resignation the following day. He was replaced as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister by Theresa May in July 2016.
7
The Article 50 Negotiating Period
The process of leaving the EU formally began on March 29, 2017, when May triggered
Article 50
of the Lisbon Treaty. The U.K. initially had two years from that date to negotiate a new relationship with the EU.
8
Following a snap election on June 8, 2017, May remained the country’s leader. However, the Conservatives lost their outright majority in Parliament and agreed on a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. This later caused May some difficulty getting her Withdrawal Agreement passed in Parliament.
9
10
Talks began on June 19, 2017. Questions swirled around the process, partly because Britain’s constitution is unwritten and because no country had left the EU using Article 50 before. A similar move happened, though, when Algeria left the EU’s predecessor after gaining independence from France in 1962, and Greenland, which was a self-governing territory, left Denmark through a special treaty in 1985.
11
On Nov. 25, 2018, Britain and the EU agreed on a 599-page Withdrawal Agreement, a Brexit deal that touched upon issues such as citizens’ rights, the divorce bill, and the Irish border. Parliament first voted on this agreement on Jan. 15, 2019. Members of Parliament voted 432 to 202 to reject the agreement, the biggest defeat for a government in the House of Commons in recent history.
12
13
May stepped down as party leader on June 7, 2019, after failing three times to get the deal she negotiated with the EU approved by the House of Commons. The following month, Boris Johnson, a former mayor of London, foreign minister, and editor of
The Spectator
, was elected prime minister.
14
Johnson, a hardline Brexit supporter, campaigned on a platform to leave the EU by the October deadline “do or die” and said he was prepared to leave the EU without a deal. The U.K. and EU negotiators agreed on a new divorce deal on Oct. 17. The main difference from May’s deal was that the Irish backstop clause was replaced with a new arrangement.
15
Another historic moment occurred in August 2019, when Johnson requested that the queen suspend Parliament from mid-September until Oct. 14, and she approved. This was seen as a ploy to stop members of Parliament from blocking a chaotic exit, and some even called it a coup of sorts. The U.K. Supreme Court’s 11 judges unanimously deemed the move unlawful on Sept. 24 and reversed it.
16
17
The negotiating period also led Britain’s political parties to face their own crises. Lawmakers left both the Conservative and Labour parties in protest. There were allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticized for his handling of the issue. In September, Johnson expelled 21 MPs for voting to delay Brexit.
18
19
The U.K. was expected to leave the EU by Oct. 31, 2019, but Parliament voted to force the government to seek an extension to the deadline and delayed a vote on the new deal.
20
Johnson then called for a general election. In the Dec. 12 election, the third general election in less than five years, Johnson’s Conservative Party won a huge majority of 365 seats in the House of Commons out of 650 seats. It managed this despite receiving only 43.6% of the vote due to its opponents being fractured between multiple parties.
21
Brexit Negotiations
Britain’s lead negotiator in the talks with Brussels was David Davis. He was a Yorkshire member of Parliament (MP) until July 9, 2018, when he resigned. He was replaced by housing minister Dominic Raab as Brexit secretary. Raab resigned in protest over May’s deal on Nov. 15, 2018. He was replaced by health and social care minister Stephen Barclay the following day.
The EU’s chief negotiator was Michel Barnier, a French politician.
Preparatory talks exposed divisions in the two sides’ approaches to the process. The U.K. wanted to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal alongside the terms of its post-Brexit relationship with Europe, while Brussels wanted to make sufficient progress on divorce terms by October 2017, only then moving on to a trade deal. In a concession that both pro- and anti-Brexit commentators took as a sign of weakness, U.K. negotiators accepted the EU’s sequenced approach.
Citizens’ Rights
One of the most politically thorny issues faced by Brexit negotiators was the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. and U.K. citizens living in the EU.
The Withdrawal Agreement allowed for the free movement of EU and U.K. citizens until the end of the transition or implementation period. Citizens were allowed to keep their residency rights if they continued to work, had sufficient resources, or were related to someone who did. To upgrade their residence status to permanent, they had to apply to the host nation. The rights of these citizens were revocable if Britain left without ratifying a deal.
22
“EU net migration, while still adding to the population as a whole, has fallen to a level last seen in 2009. We are also now seeing more EU8 citizens—those from Central and Eastern European countries, for example, Poland—leaving the U.K. than arriving,” said Jay Lindop, director of the Centre for International Migration, in a government quarterly report released in February 2019.
23
Britain’s government fought over the rights of EU citizens to remain in the U.K. after Brexit, publicly airing domestic divisions over migration. Following the referendum and Cameron’s resignation, May’s government concluded that it had the right under the “royal prerogative” to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal withdrawal process on its own.
The U.K. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Parliament had to authorize the measure, and the House of Lords amended the resulting bill to guarantee the right",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brexit.asp

What Is a Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)?
A required minimum distribution (RMD) is the amount of money that must be withdrawn annually from certain employer-sponsored retirement plans like
401(k)s
and certain
individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
, such as the traditional IRA. RMDs must be taken by April 1 after you turn 73 years old. You must calculate and withdraw the correct RMD every year after that, or face a penalty from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
.
1
RMDs do not apply to Roth accounts until after the account owner dies.
2
Key Takeaways
The required minimum distribution is the minimum amount you must take out of your retirement account after a certain age to avoid a tax penalty.
RMDs are determined by dividing the retirement account’s prior year-end fair market value by a life expectancy factor published by the IRS.
If you have multiple IRAs, you will usually need to calculate the RMD for each separately but may be able to withdraw the total RMD amount from just one account.
You can take more than the RMD.
Investopedia / NoNo Flores
Understanding Required Minimum Distributions
As noted above, a required minimum distribution is the minimum amount of money required to be withdrawn from certain retirement accounts. These accounts include 401(k)s, traditional IRAs,
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRAs
, and
SIMPLE IRAs
. The money must be taken by April 1 the year after you turn 73. The correct amount must be withdrawn or you will face a penalty.
1
RMDs are determined by dividing the fair market value (FMV) of the retirement account in the prior year-end using the applicable distribution period or life expectancy.
3
Your account custodian can tell you what your RMD is or you can calculate it on your own using IRS worksheets. Make sure that you're using the latest worksheets because the tables are updated to reflect life expectancy changes.
Different situations call for different tables. For example, if you have a non-Roth IRA and the account's sole beneficiary is your spouse, and your spouse is more than 10 years younger than you, you will need to use a different table than other account holders.
4
For traditional IRA account holders, the RMD calculation involves three steps:

Write down the account’s balance as of Dec. 31 of the previous year.
Find the distribution factor listed on the calculation tables that corresponds to your age on your birthday for the current year. For most people, this factor number ranges from 27.4 down to 1.9. As a person gets older, the factor number goes down.
Divide the account balance by the factor number to find the RMD.
5
Tip
If you don't need the funds from your RMD to live, and your income meets the requirements, you could use the RMD to contribute to a Roth IRA.
Special Considerations
There are circumstances when the RMD rules noted above don't apply. For instance, if the owner of a Roth account—a 401(k) or an IRA—dies, RMDs don't need to be taken until after they die.
1
Some
qualified plans
allow certain participants to defer the start of their RMDs until they retire, even if they are over 73. This deferment rule generally applies to plans at the workplace where they are currently employed, not to IRAs or qualified plans from previous employers. These qualified plan participants should also check with their employers to determine if they are eligible for this deferral.
6
Older workers who must take RMDs from non-Roth accounts may find themselves in higher taxable income brackets. However, there are a few strategies, like state tax loopholes, that they may take to
reduce the impact of this RMD boost in annual income
.
While an account holder must withdraw the RMD amount, they can also choose to withdraw more than that amount. If the account holder wants to withdraw 100% of their account in the first year, that’s perfectly legal, but the
tax bill could be
a bit of a shock.
Warning
RMD rules can be complex, so it's important to review
IRS Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
when making decisions regarding your distributions from an inherited IRA.
Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) and Inherited Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
Different rules apply to
inherited IRAs
. For instance:
If you as a
designated beneficiary
, you need to use the same RMD that the account owner would have used for the year they died.
RMD rules
vary depending on whether you are a surviving spouse, a minor child, or a disabled individual.
If you inherit an IRA from an account owner who died before Jan. 1, 2020, you would generally calculate your RMD using the IRS Single Life Table.
However, if the account owner died after Dec. 31, 2019, you need to follow the RMD rules established by the
SECURE Act
. These rules distinguish between eligible, designated, and non-designated beneficiaries. The timeframe and calculation of your RMD can vary greatly depending on which of these categories define you as a beneficiary.
1
Some designated beneficiaries may be required to withdraw the entire account balance by the 10th calendar year following the year of the account owner’s post-2019 death, whereas some non-designated beneficiaries may be required to withdraw the entire account balance within five years of the account owner’s death.
7
3
These rules effectively eliminate the
stretch IRA
, an estate planning strategy that some beneficiaries of inherited IRAs had used in the past to extend the tax-deferred benefits of an IRA.
1
Important
If you have multiple IRAs, you may aggregate the RMD amounts for each of them and then withdraw the total from one or a portion of the total from each.
8
Example of a Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)
You must withdraw your RMD from the relevant retirement savings account(s) by Dec. 31 every year. Funds can be withdrawn periodically throughout the year or you can wait until the year's end to earn the maximum
interest
on your funds.
3
Here's an example. Bob, a retirement account holder, turned 74 on Oct. 1. His IRA was worth $205,000 on Dec. 31 of the prior year. To calculate the annual amount to be withdrawn, that prior Dec. 31 balance is divided by the distribution factor from the relevant IRS table.
That means Bob divides $205,000 by 25.5, which is the distribution period from the latest Uniform Lifetime Table for a 74-year-old. There are other tables for beneficiaries of retirement accounts and account holders with much younger spouses.

Divide $205,000 by 25.5, and you get $8,039.22. That's the minimum amount Bob needs to withdraw from his retirement account in the current year to avoid a fine.
There are some other things Bob should keep in mind. Let's suppose Bob has
multiple IRAs
. This means the RMD for each account must be calculated separately. Depending on the types of accounts involved in this scenario, Bob may have to take RMDs from each account rather than a total amount for all RMDs from one account.
1
Fortunately, you probably don't need to worry about calculating the minimum amount to withdraw each year. Generally, the custodian of the account can calculate your RMD for you.
When Do RMDs Start?
At present, individuals
must start taking required minimum distributions
from qualified retirement accounts at age 73. Prior to 2023, the RMD age was 72. Before 2020, it was 70½.
5
Are RMD Distributions Taxed?
Yes, you are responsible for a
deferred tax liability
because RMDs are withdrawn from retirement accounts that had contributions made with pre-tax dollars. You must pay income tax on RMDs when they are taken (at your current tax bracket).
1
What If I Don't Take RMDs?
If you are over age 73 and choose not to take your RMD, you will be
penalized by the IRS
. The amount not withdrawn will be subject to a 25% tax. Before the SECURE 2.0 Act was passed in 2022, this was a 50% penalty.

According to the IRS, the penalty drops to 10% if the RMD is timely corrected within two years.""

What Is a Tariff?
Most countries are limited by their natural resources and ability to produce certain goods and services. They trade with other countries to get what their population needs and demands. However, trade isn't always conducted in an amenable manner between trading partners. Policies, geopolitics, competition, and many other factors can make trading partners unhappy.
One of the ways governments deal with trading partners they disagree with is through tariffs. A tariff is a
tax imposed
by one country on the goods and services imported from another country to influence it, raise revenues, or protect competitive advantages.
Key Takeaways
Governments impose tariffs to raise revenue, protect domestic industries, or exert political leverage over another country.
Tariffs often result in unwanted side effects, such as higher consumer prices.
Tariffs have a long and contentious history, and the debate over whether they represent good or bad policy still rages.
Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight
Understanding Tariffs
Tariffs are used to restrict
imports
. Simply put, they increase the price of goods and services purchased from another country, making them less attractive to domestic consumers.
A key point to understand is that a tariff affects the exporting country because consumers in the country that imposed the tariff might shy away from imports due to the price increase. However, if the consumer still chooses the imported product, then the tariff has essentially raised the cost of the imported product for the consumer.
There are two types of tariffs:

The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
A specific tariff is levied as a fixed fee based on the type of item, such as a $500 tariff on a car.
An
ad-valorem
tariff is levied based on the item's value, such as 5% of an import's value.
Why Governments Impose Tariffs
Governments may impose tariffs for several reasons:
To raise revenues
To protect domestic industries
To protect domestic consumers
To protect national interests
Raising Revenue
Tariffs can be used to raise revenues for governments. This kind of tariff is called a revenue tariff and is not designed to restrict imports. For instance, in 2018 and 2019, President Donald Trump and his administration imposed tariffs on many items to rebalance the trade deficit. In the fiscal year 2018, customs duties received were $41.6 billion. In fiscal year 2019, duties received were $71.9 billion.
1
2
Protecting Domestic Industries
Governments can use tariffs to benefit particular industries, often doing so to protect companies and jobs. For example, in April 2018, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on steel articles from all countries except Canada and Mexico.
3
In March 2022, President Joe Biden replaced the tariff on steel products from the United Kingdom with a tariff-rate quota of 500,000 metric tons, and reached quota deals with several other countries.
4
5
This proclamation reopened the trade of specific items with the U.K. while taking measures to protect domestic U.S. steel manufacturing and production jobs.
Protecting Domestic Consumers
By making foreign-produced goods more expensive, tariffs can make domestically produced alternatives seem more attractive. Some products made in countries with fewer regulations can harm consumers, such as a product coated in lead-based paint. Tariffs can make these products so expensive that consumers won't buy them.
Effective Feb. 1, 2025, President Donald Trump placed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10%
tariffs on imports from China
. The rationale behind these tariffs was to force these countries to cooperate with the U.S. to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs like fentanyl from entering the U.S., as well as to boost domestic manufacturing and raise revenues.
6
Protecting National Interests
Tariffs can also be used as an
extension of foreign policy
as their imposition on a trading partner's main exports may be used to exert economic leverage. For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine, much of the world protested by boycotting Russian goods or imposing sanctions. In April 2022, President Joe Biden suspended normal trade with Russia. In June, he raised the tariff on Russian imports not prohibited by the April suspension to 35%.
7
Unintended Side Effects of Tariffs
Tariffs can have unintended side effects:
They can make domestic industries less efficient and innovative by reducing competition.
They can hurt domestic consumers since a lack of competition tends to push up prices.
They can generate tensions by favoring specific industries or geographic regions over others. For example, tariffs designed to help manufacturers in cities may hurt consumers in rural areas who do not benefit from the policy and are likely to pay more for manufactured goods.
Finally, an attempt to pressure a rival country by using tariffs can devolve into an unproductive cycle of retaliation, commonly known as a
trade war
.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Tariffs
Pros
Produce revenues
Open negotiations
Support a nation's goals
Make a market predictable
Cons
Created issues between governments
Initiates trade wars
Advantages Explained
Produce revenues
: As discussed, tariffs provide a government a chance to bring in more money. This can relieve some of the tax burdens felt by a county's citizens and help the government to reduce deficits.
Open negotiations
: Tariffs can be used by countries to open negotiations for trade or other issues. Each side can use tariffs to help them create economic policies and talk with trade partners.
Support a nation's goals
: One of the most popular uses for tariffs is to use them to ensure domestic products receive preference within a country to support businesses and the economy.
Make a market predictable
: Tariffs can help stabilize a market and make prices predictable.
Disadvantages Explained
Create issues between governments
: Many nations use tariffs to punish or discourage actions they disapprove of. Unfortunately, doing this can create tensions between two countries and lead to more problems.
Initiate trade wars
: A typical response for a country with tariffs imposed on it is to respond similarly, creating a trade war in which neither country benefits from the other.
History of Tariffs
Pre-Modern Europe
In pre-modern Europe, a nation's wealth was believed to consist of fixed,
tangible assets
, such as gold, silver, land, and other physical resources. Trade was seen as a
zero-sum game
that resulted in either a clear net loss or a clear net gain of wealth. If a country imported more than it exported, a resource, mainly gold, would flow abroad, thereby draining its wealth. Cross-border trade was viewed with suspicion, and countries preferred to acquire colonies with which they could establish exclusive trading relationships rather than trading with each other.
This system, known as
mercantilism
, relied heavily on tariffs and even outright bans on trade. The colonizing country, which saw itself as competing with other colonizers, would import raw materials from its colonies, which were generally barred from selling their raw materials elsewhere. The colonizing country would convert the materials into manufactured wares, which it would sell back to the colonies. High tariffs and other barriers were implemented to ensure that colonies only purchased manufactured goods from their home countries.
8
9
New Economic Theories
The Scottish economist
Adam Smith
was one of the first to question the wisdom of this arrangement. His ""
Wealth of Nations
"" was published in 1776, the same year Britain's American colonies declared independence in response to high taxes and restrictive trade arrangements.
10
Later writers, such as
David Ricardo
, further developed Smith's ideas, leading to the theory of
comparative advantage
. It maintains that if one country is better at producing a specific product while another country is better at producing another, each should devote its resources to the activity at which it excels. The countries should trade with one another rather than erect barriers that force them to divert resources toward activities they do not perform well. According to this theory, tariffs drag economic growth, even if they can be deployed to benefit specific narrow sectors under some circumstances.

Definition
An IRA is a tax-advantaged savings account designed to help individuals save for retirement and includes traditional, Roth, SEP, and SIMPLE plans.
What Is an IRA?
An individual retirement account (IRA)—known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS—is a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account that individuals with earned income can use to save for the future.
The IRA is designed primarily for self-employed people who do not have access to workplace retirement accounts such as the 401(k), which is available only through employers. However, you can also have an IRA even if you already have a retirement plan at work.
You can open an IRA through a bank, an investment company, an online brokerage, or a personal broker.
Key Takeaways
Individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
are retirement savings accounts with tax advantages.
Types of IRAs include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRAs, and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAs.
Money held in an IRA usually can’t be withdrawn before age 59½ without incurring a hefty tax penalty of 10% of the amount withdrawn.
1
Annual income limitations apply to both the deductibility of contributions made to traditional IRAs and contributions made to Roth IRAs.
RMDs from a traditional IRA must begin at age 73.

How Does an IRA Work?
Anyone with
earned income
can open and contribute to an IRA, including those who have a 401(k) account through an employer. The only limitation is on the total that you can contribute to your retirement accounts in a single year.
The best IRA accounts will offer the ability to invest in a wide range of financial products, including
stocks
,
bonds
,
exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
, and
mutual funds
.

There are also
self-directed IRAs (SDIRAs)
that permit investors to make all the investing decisions. SDIRAs offer access to a broader selection of investments, including real estate and commodities. Only the riskiest investments are off-limits.
3
There are several kinds of IRAs, each with different rules regarding eligibility, taxation, and withdrawals. These types include:
Traditional IRAs
Roth IRAs
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRAs
Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAs
Individual taxpayers can establish traditional and Roth IRAs. Small business owners and self-employed individuals can set up SEP and SIMPLE IRAs.
An IRA must be opened with an institution that has received Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approval to offer these accounts. Choices include banks, brokerages, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations.
4
Because IRAs are meant to be used to invest and
maximize the growth of funds
for retirement savings, there is usually an
early withdrawal penalty of 10%
if you take money out before age 59½. That's in addition to taxes you'd pay on the withdrawn amount.
However, there are some
notable exceptions
to the penalty rule—withdrawals for educational expenses and first-time home purchases, among others.
5
A Roth account is funded with post-tax money, so no further taxes are due when the money is withdrawn.
Important
You can only contribute to an IRA if you have earned income. Income from interest and dividends, Social Security benefits, or child support does not count.
6
7
What Are the Different Types of IRAs and Their Rules?
The following is a breakdown of the various types of IRAs and the rules regarding each one.
Traditional IRA
In most cases, contributions to traditional IRAs are tax deductible. So, if you put $4,000 into an IRA, your taxable income for the year decreases by that amount.
In a traditional IRA, your money grows tax-deferred. When you
withdraw it after retiring
, it is taxed at your
ordinary income
tax rate for that year.
Contribution Limits
For 2024 and 2025, the maximum annual individual contribution is $7,000. The catch-up contribution continues to be $1,000 for those 50 and over.
8
If you don’t have a retirement plan at work, your traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible. But if you (or your spouse, if you are married) have a retirement plan at work, such as a
401(k)
or
403(b)
, your
modified adjusted gross income
(MAGI) determines whether and how much of your traditional IRA contributions can be deducted.
If You Have a Retirement Plan at Work
For 2024, if you are single or file as head of household and have a retirement plan at work, your traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible if your MAGI is below $77,000 ($79,000 for 2025).
8
If you are married and filing jointly, your traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible if your MAGI is below $123,000 in 2024 ($126,000 in 2025). From there, the deductibility of your contributions starts to phase out as your MAGI increases.
8
Warning
It is possible to have both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA or several IRAs at different institutions. However, the total annual contribution to all of your IRAs cannot exceed $7,000 (or $8,000 for those age 50 or older) for 2024 and 2025.
9
For 2024, the income range that phases out the deductibility of traditional IRA contributions for married couples is $123,000 to $143,000. For 2025, it's $126,000 to $146,000.
8
For single taxpayers or heads of households, the phase-out range for 2024 is $77,000 to $87,000.
10
For 2025, it is $79,000 to $89,000.
8
If You Don't Have a Plan at Work but Your Spouse Does
If you contribute to an IRA and aren't covered by a workplace plan but are married to someone who is, the income phase-out range in 2024 is $230,000 to $240,000 ($236,000 to $246,000 for 2025).

Roth IRA
Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible in the year in which you make them. But the distributions are tax-free. That means you contribute to a Roth IRA using after-tax dollars and pay no taxes, even on your investment gains.
Also, Roth IRAs do not have
required minimum distributions (RMDs)
. If you don’t need the money, you don’t have to take it out of your account (where it continues growing tax-free). You can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you have eligible earned income, no matter how old you are.
11
Roth IRA contribution limits for the 2024 and 2025
tax years
are the same as they are for traditional IRAs. However, there is a catch: There are
income limitations
on contributions to a Roth IRA.
The phase-out range for single filers is $146,000 to $161,000 for 2024 ($150,000 to $165,000 for 2025). For married couples filing joint returns, the phase-out range is $230,000 to $240,000 in 2024 ($236,000 to $246,000 in 2025).

Definition
An inverted yield curve means yields decrease the further out the maturity date is.
What Is an Inverted Yield Curve?
The yield curve graphically represents yields on similar
debt securities
across a variety of maturities. A normal yield curve slopes upward, displaying yields that run from low to high as maturities increase. However, an inverted yield curve reveals long-term
interest rates
are lower than short-term interest rates.
Key Takeaways
An inverted yield curve is also referred to as a negative yield curve.
The inverted curve has proven to be a reliable indicator of a recession.
The inverted curve reflects bond investors’ expectations for a decline in longer-term interest rates.
Laura Porter / Investopedia
Understanding Inverted Yield Curves
The yield curve shows the borrowing cost associated with debt securities of different
maturities
. Normally, the yields for shorter-term securities are lower than those for longer-term securities. That is, the yield curve typically slopes upward, reflecting the fact that holders of longer-term debt have taken on more risk.
The yield curve is also known as the
term structure of interest rates
. For example, the U.S. Treasury publishes daily Treasury bill and bond yields that can be charted as a curve.
1
Analysts often distill yield curve signals to a
spread
between two maturities. This simplifies the task of interpreting a yield curve in which an inversion exists between some maturities but not others. The downside is that there is no general agreement as to which spread serves as the most reliable
recession
indicator.
2
Inverted Yield Curve.

As illustrated above, a yield curve inverts when long-term interest rates drop below short-term rates, indicating that investors are moving money away from short-term bonds and into long-term ones. This suggests that the market as a whole is becoming more pessimistic about the economic prospects for the near future.

Such an inversion has served as a relatively reliable recession indicator in the modern era.

4
Because yield curve inversions are relatively rare yet have often preceded recessions, they typically draw heavy scrutiny from financial market participants.
Indicative Spreads
Academic studies of the relationship between an inverted yield curve and recessions have tended to look at the spread between the yields on the 10-year
U.S. Treasury bond
and the three-month Treasury bill. On the other hand, market participants have more often focused on the yield spread between the 10-year and two-year bonds.
3
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that he prefers to gauge recession risk by focusing on the difference between the current three-month Treasury bill rate and the market pricing of derivatives predicting the same rate 18 months later.
5
6
Historical Examples of Inverted Yield Curves
The 10-year to two-year Treasury spread has been a generally reliable recession indicator since providing a false positive in the mid-1960s.
7
That hasn’t stopped a long list of senior U.S. economic officials from discounting its predictive powers over the years.
8
In 1998, the 10-year/two-year spread briefly inverted after the Russian debt default. Quick interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve helped avert a U.S. recession.
In 2006, the spread inverted for much of the year. Long-term Treasury bonds went on to outperform stocks during 2007. The
Great Recession
began in December 2007.
On Aug. 28, 2019, the 10-year/two-year spread briefly went negative. The U.S. economy suffered a two-month recession in February and March of 2020 amid the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could not have been a consideration embedded in bond prices six months earlier.
Fast Fact
While an inverted yield curve has often preceded recessions in recent decades, it does not cause them. Rather, bond prices reflect investors’ expectations that longer-term yields will decline, as typically happens in a recession.
Is This Yield Curve Inverted?
At the end of 2022, against a backdrop of surging
inflation
, the yield curve got inverted again. As of Dec. 30, 2022, the spread between the 10-year and two-year yields, 3.88% and 4.41%, respectively, was 53 percentage points.
9
As of March 13, 2025, Treasury yields were as follows:
9
Three-month Treasury yield: 4.34%
Two-year Treasury yield: 3.94%
10-year Treasury yield: 4.27%
30-year Treasury yield: 4.59%
As you can see above (and in the chart below that compares the spread on both dates), the bellwether spread is not inverted. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate was 33 percentage points above the two-year yield on March 13, 2025.

What Is a Yield Curve?
A yield curve is a line created by plotting yields (interest rates) of bonds of the same credit quality but differing maturities. The most closely watched yield curve is that for U.S. Treasury debt.
What Can Investors Learn From an Inverted Yield Curve?
Historically, protracted inversions of the yield curve have preceded recessions in the U.S. An inverted yield curve reflects investors’ expectations for a decline in longer-term interest rates as a result of a deteriorating economic performance.
Why Is the 10-Year to 2-Year Spread Important?
Many investors use the spread between the yields on 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasury bonds as a yield curve proxy and a relatively reliable leading indicator of a recession. Some Federal Reserve officials have argued that a focus on shorter-term maturities is more informative about the likelihood of a recession.
The Bottom Line
A yield curve that inverts for an extended period of time appears to be a more reliable recession signal than one that inverts briefly, whichever yield spread you use as a proxy.
Fortunately, however, recessions are rare enough that we haven’t had enough of them to draw definitive conclusions. As one Federal Reserve researcher has noted, “It’s hard to predict recessions. We haven’t had many, and we don’t fully understand the causes of the ones we’ve had. Nevertheless, we persist in trying.”

What Is Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)?
Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a type of delivery agreement—outlined by the International Chamber of Commerce—whereby the
seller
assumes all of the responsibility, risk, and costs associated with transporting goods until the receiver/customer receives (or transfers) the goods at the destination port.
This delivery agreement includes paying for shipping costs, export and import duties,
insurance
, and any other expenses incurred during shipping to an agreed-upon location in the receiver/customer's country.
Key Takeaways
Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a delivery agreement, whereby the seller assumes all responsibility for transporting the goods until they reach an agreed-upon destination.
Delivered duty paid (DDP) is an International Commercial Term (also called an Incoterm); these terms are outlined by the International Chamber of Commerce and function as a set of internationally recognized rules, defining the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in trade contracts.
Under this delivery agreement, the seller must arrange for all transportation and associated costs, including export clearance and customs documentation required to reach the destination port.
Delivered duty paid (DDP) is an advantageous delivery agreement for receivers/customers because the seller assumes most of the liability and costs for shipping.
Investopedia / Jessica Olah
Understanding Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)
Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a shipping agreement that places the maximum responsibility on the seller. In addition to shipping costs, the seller is obligated to arrange for
import
clearance, tax payment, and
import duty
. The risk only transfers to the receiver/customer once the goods are made available to the receiver/customer at the port of destination. The seller and the receiver/customer must agree on all payment details and state the name of the place of destination before finalizing the transaction.
1
DDP is an International Commercial Term (also called an Incoterm)—a set of internationally recognized rules that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in trade contracts. Incoterms are defined by the International Chamber of Commerce and play key roles in global commerce.
There are different types of delivery agreements: DDP can be contrasted with DDU (
deliver duty unpaid
). With DDU, the receiver/customer is contacted by customs once their shipment arrives, and the receiver/customer has to settle any charges before customs releases the shipment and delivers it to the customer.
The benefits of DDP lean in favor of the receiver/customer—versus the seller—because the receiver/customer assumes less liability and fewer costs in the shipping process; this, therefore, places a great deal of burden on the seller.
2
Seller's Responsibilities
The seller arranges for transportation through a carrier and is responsible for the cost of that carrier, as well as acquiring customs clearance in the buyer's country—including obtaining the appropriate approvals from the authorities in that country. Also, the seller may need to acquire a license for importation. However, the seller is not responsible for unloading the goods.
3
The seller’s responsibilities include providing the goods, drawing up a sales contract and related documents, export packaging, arranging for export clearance, satisfying all import,
export
, and customs requirements, and paying for all transportation costs, including final delivery to an agreed-upon destination.
3
The seller must arrange for proof of delivery and pay the cost of all inspections and must alert the buyer once the goods are delivered to the agreed-upon location. In a DDP transaction, if the goods are damaged or lost in transit, the seller is liable for the costs.
3
Managing Customs
It is not always possible for the shipper to clear the goods through customs in foreign countries. Customs requirements for DDP shipments vary by country. In some countries, import clearance is complicated and lengthy, so it is preferable if the buyer—who has intimate knowledge of the process—manages this process.
If a DDP shipment does not clear customs, customs may ignore the fact that the shipment falls under a DDP agreement and delay the shipment. Depending on the customs' decision, this may result in the seller using different, more costly delivery methods.
Special Considerations
DDP is used when the cost of supply is relatively stable and easy to predict. The seller is subject to the most risk, so a DDP agreement is normally used by advanced suppliers; however, some experts believe that there are reasons U.S. exporters and importers should avoid using DDP agreements.
4
U.S. exporters, for example, may be subject to
value-added tax (VAT)
at a rate of up to 20%.
5
Moreover, the buyer is eligible to receive a VAT refund. Exporters are also subject to unexpected storage and
demurrage
costs that might occur due to delays by customs, agencies, or carriers. Bribery is a risk that could bring severe consequences both with the U.S. government and a foreign country.
For U.S. importers, because the seller and its forwarder are controlling the transportation, the importer has limited information about the
supply chain
. Also, a seller may pad their prices to cover the cost of liability for the shipment costs or markup freight bills.
If DDP is handled poorly, inbound shipments are likely to be examined by customs, which causes delays. Late shipments may also occur because a seller may use cheaper, less reliable transportation services to reduce their costs.
Important
Since DDP is an important aspect of
customer relationship management (CRM)
for delivery companies, it's important for businesses to invest in the
best CRM software
currently available.
What Does Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) Mean for an Exporter?
DDP indicates that the seller (exporter) assumes all the risk and transportation costs. The seller must also clear the goods for export at the shipping port and import at the destination. Moreover, the seller must pay export and import duties for goods shipped under DDP.
What Is the Difference Between Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) and Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU)?
In the world of global commerce, delivered duty unpaid (DDU) is a type of delivery agreement that outlines that it's the receiver/customer's responsibility to pay for any of the destination country's customs charges, duties, or taxes. Conversely, delivered duty paid (DDP) means it's the shipper's responsibility to pay any of the customs charges, duties, and/or taxes required to send the product to the destination country.
What Are the Various Incoterms?
International commercial terms—also called ""Incoterms""—clarify the rules and terms buyers and sellers use in international and domestic trade contracts. Some Incoterms include:
ex works (EXW)
;
free carrier (FCA)
;
carriage paid to (CPT)
;
carriage and insurance paid to (CIP)
;
delivered at place (DAP)
; delivered at place unloaded (DPU);
delivery at frontier (DAF)
;
delivery ex-ship (DES)
; delivered duty paid (DDP); deliver duty unpaid (DDU);
free alongside ship (FAS)
;
free on foard (FOB)
;
cost and freight (CFR)
; and
cost, insurance, and freight (CIF)
.
6
The Bottom Line
Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a type of delivery agreement used in international commerce. A DDP agreement outlines that the seller must pay for shipping costs, export and import duties,

DDP is an international commercial term—introduced by the International Chamber of Commerce; these terms refer to a set of internationally recognized rules, defining the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in trade contracts.
In general, DDP is used when the cost of supply is relatively stable and easy to predict. The seller is subject to the majority of the risk, so DDP agreements are normally used by advanced suppliers.

Investopedia,Who Was John Maynard Keynes & What Is Keynesian Economics?,"Close
John Maynard Keynes was an early 20th-century British economist, best known as the founder of Keynesian economics and the father of modern
macroeconomics
. One of the hallmarks of Keynesian economics is the idea that governments should actively try to influence the course of economies, especially by increasing spending to stimulate demand in the face of
recession
.
In his seminal work, ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money""—considered one of the most influential economics books in history—Keynes advocated for government intervention as a solution to high unemployment.
Key Takeaways
British economist John Maynard Keynes was the founder of Keynesian economics.
Keynesian economics argues that demand drives supply.
To create jobs and boost consumer buying power during a recession, Keynes held that governments should increase spending, even if it means going into debt.
Critics attack Keynesian economics for promoting deficit spending, stifling private investment, and causing inflation.
Education and Early Career
Keynes’ early interest in economics was due in large part to his father, John Neville Keynes, an economics lecturer at Cambridge University. His mother, one of Cambridge's first female graduates, was active in charitable work for the underprivileged.
1
Born into a middle-class family, he received scholarships to two of the most elite schools in England, Eton College and Cambridge University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1904. He excelled at mathematics throughout his academic career, and notably, he had almost no formal training in economics.
Early in his career, Keynes worked on probability theory and lectured in economics as a fellow of King's College at Cambridge University. His government roles ranged from official positions in the British Civil Service and the British Treasury to appointments to royal commissions on currency and finance, including his 1919 appointment as the Treasury’s financial representative at the Versailles peace conference that ended World War I.

Advocacy of Government Intervention in the Economy
Keynes' father was an advocate of
laissez-faire economics
, an economic philosophy of
free-market
capitalism that opposes government intervention. Keynes himself was a conventional believer in the principles of the free market (and an active investor in the stock market) during his time at Cambridge.
However, after the
1929 stock market crash
triggered the
Great Depression
, Keynes came to believe that unrestricted free-market capitalism was essentially flawed and needed to be reformulated, not only to function better in its own right but also to outperform competitive systems like communism.
3
As a result, he began advocating for government intervention to curb unemployment and correct economic recession. In addition to government jobs programs, he argued that increased government spending was necessary to decrease unemployment—even if it meant a
budget deficit
.
What Is Keynesian Economics?
The theories of John Maynard Keynes, known as
Keynesian economics
, center around the idea that governments should play an active role in their countries' economies, instead of just letting the free market reign. Specifically, Keynes advocated government spending to mitigate downturns in business cycles.
The most basic principle of Keynesian economics is that demand—not supply—is the driving force of an economy. At the time, conventional economic wisdom held the opposite view: that supply creates demand. Because
aggregate demand
—the total spending for and consumption of goods and services by the private sector and the government—drives supply, total spending determines all economic outcomes, from the production of goods to the employment rate.
Another basic principle of Keynesian economics is that the best way to pull an economy out of a recession is for the government to increase demand by infusing the economy with capital. In short, consumption (spending) is the key to economic recovery.
4
These two principles are the basis of Keynes' belief that demand is so important that, even if a government has to go into debt to spend, it should do so. According to Keynes, the government boosting the economy in this way will stimulate consumer demand, which in turn spurs production and ensures full employment.
Criticism of Keynesian Economics
Although widely adopted after World War II, Keynesian economics has attracted plenty of criticism since the ideas were first introduced in the 1930s.
One major criticism deals with the concept of big government—the expansion of federal initiatives that must occur to enable the government to participate actively in the economy. Rival economic theorists, like those of the Austrian School of Economics, argue that: Economic recessions and booms are part of the natural order of business cycles; direct government intervention only worsens the recovery process; and federal spending discourages private investment.
4
5
The most famous critic of Keynesian economics was
Milton Friedman
, an American economist best known for his advocacy of free-market capitalism. Considered the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century—as Keynes was the most influential economist of the first half—Friedman advocated
monetarism
, which refuted important parts of Keynesian economics.
6
Keynes held that
fiscal policy
—government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions—is more important than
monetary policy
—control of the overall supply of money available to banks, consumers, and businesses.
4
In contrast, Friedman and fellow monetarists held that governments could foster economic stability by targeting the growth rate of the money supply. In short, Friedman and monetarist economists
advocate the control of money in the economy
, while Keynesian economists advocate government expenditure.
6
For example, while Keynes believed that an interventionist government could moderate recessions by using fiscal policy to prop up aggregate demand, spur consumption, and reduce unemployment, Friedman criticized
deficit spending
and argued for a return to the free market, including smaller government and deregulation in most areas of the economy, supplemented by a steady increase of the money supply.
Keynesian vs. Laissez-Faire Economics
With its advocacy of government intervention in the economy, Keynesian economics is in sharp contrast to laissez-faire economics, which argues that the less the government is involved in economic affairs, the better for business and society as a whole.
Examples of Keynesian Economics
The New Deal
The onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s significantly influenced Keynes’ economic theories and led to the widespread adoption of several of his policies.
To address the crisis in the U.S., President Franklin Roosevelt enacted the
New Deal
, a series of government programs that directly reflected the Keynesian principle that even a free-enterprise capitalist system requires some federal oversight.
With the New Deal, the U.S. government intervened to stimulate the national economy on an unprecedented scale, including creating several new agencies focused on providing jobs to unemployed Americans and stabilizing the price of consumer goods. Roosevelt also adopted Keynes' policy of expanded deficit spending to stimulate demand, including programs for public housing, slum clearance, railroad construction, and other massive public works.
Great Recession Spending
In response to the
Great Recession
of 2007–2009, President Barack Obama took several steps that reflected Keynesian economic theory. The federal government bailed out debt-ridden companies in several industries. It also took into conservatorship
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
, the two major market makers and guarantors of mortgages and home loans.
In 2009, President Obama signed the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
, an $831-billion government stimulus package designed to save existing jobs and create new ones.
7
It included tax cuts/credits and unemployment benefits for families; it also earmarked expenditures for healthcare, infrastructure, and education.
COVID-19 Stimulus Checks
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump and President Joseph Biden offered a variety of
relief, loan-forgiveness, and loan-extension programs
.
The U.S. government also supplemented weekly state unemployment benefits and sent American taxpayers direct aid in the form of three separate, tax-free
stimulus checks
.
Legacy
Since the 1930s, the popularity of Keynesian economics has risen and fallen, and the theories have undergone considerable revision since Keynes' day. However, the economic school of thought he founded has left one indelible stamp on modern nations: the idea that governments have a role to play in business—even in capitalist economies.
Who Said Keynesian Economics Was Spending Your Way out of a Recession?
It was Milton Friedman who attacked the central Keynesian idea that consumption is the key to economic recovery as trying to ""spend your way out of a recession.""
8
Unlike Keynes, Friedman believed that government spending and racking up debt eventually leads to inflation—a rise in prices that lessens the value of money and wages—which can be disastrous unless accompanied by underlying economic growth. The
stagflation
of the 1970s was a case in point: It was paradoxically a period with high unemployment and low production, but also high inflation and high-interest rates.
Was Keynes a Socialist?
It is difficult to pigeonhole Keynes as a socialist.
On the one hand, he showed an interest in socialist regimes a",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp

Definition
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated by dividing net operating profit after tax by invested capital.
What Is Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)?
Return on invested capital (ROIC) shows how efficiently a company uses its capital to generate profits. Comparing a company’s ROIC with its
weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) reveals whether the company's
invested capital
is used effectively.
Besides ROIC, businesses use other metrics to assess how well the company uses capital, including
economic value added
and
return on capital employed
.
Key Takeaways
Invested capital is the money raised by a company by issuing securities to equity shareholders and debt to bondholders.
Analysts and investors can compare a company's ROIC with entities in the same sector.
A company creates value when ROIC exceeds its weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Dennis Madamba / Investopedia
Formula and Calculation of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
The formula for ROIC is:
ROIC
=
NOPAT
Invested Capital
where:
NOPAT
=
Net operating profit after tax
\begin{aligned} &\text{ROIC} = \frac{ \text{NOPAT} }{ \text{Invested Capital} } \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{NOPAT} = \text{Net operating profit after tax} \\ \end{aligned}
​
ROIC
=
Invested Capital
NOPAT
​
where:
NOPAT
=
Net operating profit after tax
​
Written another way, ROIC = (net income – dividends) / (debt + equity). The ROIC formula is calculated by assessing the value in the denominator, total capital, the sum of a company’s debt and equity.
There are several ways to calculate this value. One is to subtract cash and non-interest-bearing current liabilities(NIBCL)—including tax liabilities and accounts payable, as long as these are not subject to interest or fees—from total assets.
Another method of calculating invested capital is to add the book value of a company’s equity to the book value of its debt and then subtract non-operating assets, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and assets of discontinued operations.
Yet another way to calculate invested capital is to obtain the working capital figure by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Next, you obtain non-cash working capital by subtracting cash from the working capital value you just calculated. Finally, non-cash working capital is added to a company’s fixed assets.
Important
ROIC higher than the cost of capital means a company is healthy and growing, while ROIC lower than the cost of capital suggests an unsustainable business model.
The value in the numerator can also be calculated in several ways. The most straightforward way is to subtract dividends from a company’s net income.

On the other hand, because a company may have benefited from a one-time source of income unrelated to its core business—a windfall from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, for example—it is often preferable to look at net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). NOPAT is calculated by adjusting the operating profit for taxes:
NOPAT = (operating profit) × (1 – effective tax rate)
What ROIC Can Tell You
ROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value. It should be compared to a company’s
cost of capital
to determine whether the company is creating value.
If ROIC is greater than a firm’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—the most commonly used cost of capital metric—value is being created, and these firms will trade at a premium.
A common benchmark for evidence of value creation is a return of two percentage points above the firm’s cost of capital.
Fast Fact
Many companies will report their effective tax rates for the quarter or fiscal year in their earnings releases, but not all companies do this, meaning it may be necessary to calculate the rate by dividing a company’s tax expense by its net income.
1
Some firms run at a zero-return level. While they may not be destroying value, these companies have no excess capital to invest in future growth.
To get a better idea of what a decent or acceptable ROIC is, you can compare companies operating in the same sector. If a company consistently delivers higher ROIC than its peer group, this suggests it is better run and more profitable. In the case of mature, established companies, comparing current ROIC with past ROIC can also be useful.
ROIC Works Well Alongside Valuation Metrics
ROIC provides the necessary context for other metrics such as the
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
. Viewed in isolation, the P/E ratio might suggest a company is oversold, but the decline could be because the company is no longer generating value for shareholders at the same rate (or at all).
On the other hand, companies that consistently generate high rates of return on invested capital probably deserve to trade at a premium compared with other stocks.
Example of How to Use ROIC
Target Corp. (
TGT
) calculates its ROIC directly in its 10-K, showing the components that went into the calculation:
2
The ROIC calculation begins with operating income and then adds net other income to get EBIT. Operating lease interest is then added back and income taxes are subtracted to get net operating profits after tax (NOPAT).
2
Target’s invested capital includes shareholder equity, long-term debt, and operating lease liabilities. Target subtracts cash and cash equivalents from the sum of those figures to get its invested capital and reports an after-tax return on invested capital of 16.1%, which is an improvement over the previous year’s 12.6%.
2
Limitations of Using ROIC
ROIC is one of the most important and informative valuation
metrics
. However, it is more important in some
sectors
than others. Some companies, such as those that operate oil rigs or manufacture semiconductors, invest capital much more intensively than those that require less equipment.
A major downside of this metric is that it tells us nothing about what segment of the business is generating value. If you make your calculation based on net income (minus dividends) instead of NOPAT, the result can be even more opaque, since the return may derive from a single, nonrecurring event.
What Is Invested Capital?
Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by issuing securities—which is the sum of the company’s equity, debt, and capital lease obligations. Invested capital is not a line item in the company’s financial statement because debt, capital leases, and shareholder equity are each listed separately on the balance sheet.
What Does Return on Invested Capital Tell You?
Return on invested capital (ROIC) indicates how efficiently a company puts the capital under its control toward profitable investments or projects. The ROIC ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using the money it has raised to generate returns. Comparing a company’s return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reveals whether invested capital is being used effectively.
How Do You Calculate ROIC?
The ROIC formula is net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. Companies with a steady or improving return on capital are unlikely to put significant amounts of new capital to work. Investors and analysts might also use the
return on new invested capital
(RONIC) calculation to determine the value of deploying new or additional capital to a new or existing project.
The Bottom Line
ROIC is a widely used financial metric. It tells us how well a company uses its capital and whether it is creating value with its investments.
At a minimum, a company’s ROIC should be higher than its cost of capital. If it consistently isn’t, then the business model is not sustainable.
ROIC is particularly useful when examining companies in industries that rely on investing a large amount of capital. Like many metrics, it is most informative when used to compare similar companies operating in the same sector. Often, the companies in a sector with the highest ROICs will trade at a premium.

What Is Underwriting?
Underwriting is the process through which an individual or institution takes on
financial risk
for a fee. This risk most typically involves
loans
, insurance, or investments. The term underwriter originated from the practice of having each risk-taker write their name under the total amount of risk they were willing to accept for a specified premium.
Although the mechanics have changed over time, underwriting remains a key function in the financial world.
Key Takeaways
Underwriting is the process through which an individual or institution takes on financial risk for a fee.
Underwriters assess the degree of risk within a given business.
Underwriting helps to set fair borrowing rates for loans, establish appropriate insurance premiums, and create a market for securities by accurately pricing investment risk.
Underwriting ensures that a company filing for an IPO will raise the capital it needs while providing the underwriters with a premium or profit for their services.
Investors benefit from underwriting's vetting process by helping them make informed investment decisions.
Investopedia / Joules Garcia
How Underwriting Works
Underwriting involves conducting research and assessing the degree of risk each applicant or entity brings to the table before assuming that risk. This check helps to set fair borrowing rates for loans, establish appropriate
premiums
to adequately cover the true cost of insuring policyholders, and create a market for
securities
by accurately pricing investment risk. If the risk is deemed too high, an underwriter may refuse coverage.
Risk
is the underlying factor in all underwriting. In the case of a loan, the risk is whether the borrower will repay the loan as agreed or will default. With insurance, the risk may involve the likelihood that an individual prospective insured might file a claim, or that too many policyholders will file claims at the same time. With securities, the risk is that the underwritten investments will not be profitable.
Underwriters evaluate loans (particularly mortgages) to determine the likelihood that a borrower will pay as promised and that enough
collateral
is available in the event of
default
. In the insurance industry, underwriters seek to assess a policyholder's health and related factors, a driver's safety record, or the security of a home. They aim to price insurance premiums appropriately while spreading the potential risk among as many people as possible. Underwriting securities, most often done via
initial public offerings
(IPOs), helps determine the company's underlying value compared to the risk of funding its IPO.
Types of Underwriting
There are three major types of underwriting: loans, insurance, and securities.
Loan Underwriting
All loans undergo some form of underwriting. In many cases, underwriting is
automated
, It involves appraising an applicant's credit history, financial records, and the value of any collateral offered, along with other factors that depend on the size and purpose of the loan. The appraisal process can take a few minutes to a few weeks, depending on whether the appraisal requires a human being to be involved.
The most common type of loan underwriting that involves a human underwriter is for
mortgages
. This is also the type of loan underwriting that most people encounter. The underwriter assesses income, liabilities (debt), savings, credit history, credit score, and more depending on an individual's financial circumstances. Mortgage underwriting typically has a turnaround time of a week or less.
Refinancing
often takes longer because buyers who face deadlines get preferential treatment. Although loan applications can be approved, denied, or suspended, most are
approved with conditions
, meaning the underwriter wants clarification or additional documentation before the agreement can be finalized.
Insurance Underwriting
Insurance underwriters receive customer applications and decide whether to offer them a policy on the basis of various criteria. If they do approve the application, the underwriters also set premiums and coverage amounts.
1
With insurance underwriting, the focus is on the potential policyholder—the person seeking health, home, auto, or life insurance. In the past, medical underwriting for
health insurance
looked at the applicant’s pre-existing conditions to determine how much to charge an applicant, or whether to offer coverage at all, often based on the applicant’s pre-existing conditions. Beginning in 2014, under the
Affordable Care Act
, insurers were no longer allowed to deny coverage or impose limitations based on pre-existing conditions.
Life insurance underwriting seeks to assess the risk of insuring a potential policyholder based on their age, health, lifestyle, occupation, family medical history, hobbies, and
other factors
determined by the underwriter. Life insurance underwriting can result in approval—along with a range of coverage amounts, prices, exclusions, and conditions—or outright rejection.
For property and casualty insurance, underwriters look at numerous criteria, including characteristics of the person and the property being insured. For example, if someone applies for
automobile insurance
, the carrier looks at their driving record, how often their make and model of car is in an accident, and the average cost of repairs. Similarly, to ensure a home, underwriters focuses on such factors as replacement cost, age of the dwelling, and any significant risks (such as being in an area prone to wildfires) to decide whether to offer the applicant
homeowners insurance
and how much to charge.
Securities Underwriting
Investment securities underwriting, which seeks to assess risk and the appropriate price of particular securities—most often related to an IPO—is performed on behalf of a potential investor, often an investment bank. Based on the results of the underwriting process, an
investment bank
would buy (underwrite) securities issued by the company attempting the IPO and then sell those securities in the open market.
Underwriting ensures that the company's IPO will raise the capital needed and provides the underwriters with a premium or profit for their service. Investors benefit from the
vetting
process that underwriting provides and its ability to make an informed investment decision.
This type of underwriting can involve individual stocks and debt securities, including government, corporate, or municipal bonds. Underwriters or their employers purchase these securities to resell them for a profit either to investors or dealers (who sell them to other buyers). When more than one underwriter or group of underwriters is involved, this is known as an
underwriter syndicate
.
How Long Does Underwriting Take?
The time frame for underwriting varies among different investment products, as the underwriter will have to spend some time examining the risk profile of each investment. Personal loans and insurance products are generally fairly simple to underwritem while securities are more complex. However, underwriting periods for mortages and insurance can vary by state.
2
Personal Loans and Mortgages
For car loans, the process is often managed by an algorithm that compares the applicant to other borrowers with a similar profile. This process takes only a few days at most, and, in some cases, it is almost instantaneous.
Home mortgages tend to take longer because the underwriter will need to verify the borrower's income, employment, and credit history, which can take some time. Full approval for a home loan can take up to 45 days, although the underwriting process itself accounts for only a small part of this time time. The underwriting process can last from a few days to a few weeks.
3
Insurance
Underwriting insurance is similar to underwriting a loan, except that the insurers weigh the probability and size of the average claim compared to the premiums that they expect to collect. In the case of property and auto insurance policies, this is based on factors like the age of the insured, their geographical location, and their past history of making claims. For homeowners and commercial property coverages, they must avoid a large concentration of risks in the same geographic area, as a catastrophic event (such as a hurricane) would mean huge losses for the company.
Life insurance policies are more complicated because they also account for the insured's medical history and other personal details. Underwriting life insurance can also take a month or longer, although most decisions are iss",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp

Year-to-date information is used to analyze investment returns, business performance, and personal earnings.
What Is YTD?
Year to date (YTD) is a common phrase in finance, used to define how an investment has fared since the beginning of the year. With YTD, a time frame spanning the start of the year to a later date of choice within that same year, investors can track the progress or performance of a company’s sales, profits, expenses, investment returns, or an individual's earnings.
Key Takeaways
The start date depends on whether a fiscal or calendar year is used.
A fiscal year is the twelve months companies choose to use for accounting reporting.
Investors can use YTD data to analyze portfolios and make changes.
Investopedia / Matthew Collins
Fiscal Year vs. Calendar Year
The start date of YTD depends on whether it’s a calendar or fiscal year.
The calendar year is the annual period most people follow, beginning on Jan. 1 and ending on Dec. A
fiscal year
is a 12-month companies and other entities choose for accounting purposes that better aligns with their revenue and expenses. It also lasts a year but doesn’t necessarily begin on Jan. 1.
If a calendar year is used, YTD means from Jan. 1 of the current year to the date specified (usually today). Conversely, if the subject has a different fiscal year, YTD would cover when its fiscal year starts, which could be anytime during the year, up to the date given.
Suppose a company with a fiscal year running from Feb. 1 to Jan. 31, which is common among retailers, publishes its financials for the year up to April 30. The dates covered would be as follows:

Fiscal YTD
: Feb. 1 to April 30
Conversely, if the calendar year was used, the period would be as follows:
Calendar YTD
: Jan. 1 to April 30
Important
If there’s no mention of the YTD being a calendar or fiscal year, it generally means it starts Jan. 1.
Applications of YTD
YTD is a great tool for tracking progress and can be compared against past data or competitors. This means it is highly influential and not just utilized by companies. Below, we look at some of the most common applications.
Investment Returns
YTD is used by investors to determine the performance of investments relative to their goals, expectations, past performance, and
benchmarks
. It can represent an idea time frame. Daily or monthly measures are often too short, and overall gains or losses are too long.
Periodically looking at the YTD returns of all assets in an investment
portfolio
and analyzing the findings can prompt smart and timely tweaks to holdings. Based on this research, investors may, for instance, opt to cash in on a high-performing investment that now appears overvalued and poised for a profit-grabbing sell-off or offload one that is performing poorly, not meeting expectations, and could be one more piece of bad news away from crashing hard.
To aid in decision-making, it’s possible to compare this YTD data to past years, other investments, and the overall market. For example, if a portfolio of stocks or a
mutual fund
is consistently underperforming the general market, as reflected in a relevant market index such as the S&P 500 Index, it might be worth picking up a cheaper exchange-traded fund instead.
Business Performance
Companies analyze YTD information to determine if specific metrics are improving or worsening and strategic goals and objectives are being met. With YTD, it’s possible to track progress in real-time, which makes it easier to promptly gauge trends, update budgets and forecasts, fix issues, and capitalize on areas of success.
For example, a company could discover YTD sales are lagging behind projections or the competition and respond by changing or boosting its marketing campaigns. Conversely, if YTD performance is exceeding expectations, the company might explore opportunities to further capitalize and expand.
In addition, a company may notice its expenses are higher than projected. By taking immediate action, such as cutting discretionary spending or modifying its prices, it can attempt to stay within its annual budget and avoid eroding its yearly profit.
Personal Earnings
Employee YTD earnings are typically displayed on their paycheck. This figure is the total amount of money earned from the beginning of the current calendar year up to the date the document is issued.
On your pay stub, you should see gross pay, which is the total the employer paid, and net pay, which is the amount you keep after deductions, such as
Medicare
and
Social Security
withholdings, and
income tax
payments. These deductions are broken down and subtracted from gross earnings to arrive at net earnings, the amount transferred to the employee’s bank account.
Tracking earnings and deductions gives individuals an idea of how much they have been paid so far this year and where the rest of their wages went. This information can serve various purposes, including budgeting and calculating taxes.
Calculating YTD
Calculating YTD is straightforward while annualizing YTD figures for comparison purposes is trickier.
Basic Calculation
The basic YTD calculation is relatively simple. To capture the growth or decline of sales, earnings, expenses, investment portfolio valuations, or other numbers from the start of the year to the present, all you need to do is take the following steps:
Obtain the current and beginning values at the start of the year (from Jan. 1 or the first day of the fiscal year).
Subtract the starting figure from the figure reached at the end of the YTD period.
Divide the result by the starting-year value.
Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.
Complex Calculations
For YTD to be effective, sometimes you need to annualize the figure.
Annualizing makes it easier to compare returns or charges over different periods. For example, if your portfolio rose 8% in value last year and is up 4% by June of the following year, you won’t be able to tell if you’re on track to beat last year’s return unless you convert this year’s figure into a comparable annual figure.
This can be done by taking the following steps:
Divide the value at the specified end date by the value at the beginning of the year.
Raise the result to 12 divided by the number of months that have passed.
Subtract 1.
Multiply the result by 100 to get a percentage.
1
Examples of YTD Calculations
Suppose you wanted to determine how well one of the stocks in your portfolio performed so far this year. At the beginning of the year (Jan. 1), your holding was valued at $9,000. Now, at the end of September, it is up to $9,500.
To get the YTD growth percentage, subtract $9,500 (the current figure) from $9,000 (the starting figure), divide the result by $9,000, and then multiply by 100. The result is 5.56%.
If you wanted to compare that to last year’s performance of 8%, you’d need to annualize the return. This can be achieved in the following way:
Divide $9,500 by $9,000 = 1.0556
Raise that to the power of 1.333 (12/9) = 1.0746.
1.0746 – 1 = 0.0746.
0.0746 × 100 = 7.46.
The annualized return based on the first nine months of the year is 7.46%.
Month-to-Date vs. YTD
Month-to-date (MTD) covers the first day of the current month up to the last complete business day before the current date within that same month. For example, if today’s date is June 20, MTD would run from June 1 to June 19.
MTD functions like YTD and is used in the same way to track progress and gauge performance, albeit over a shorter period.
Using the example above, MTD sales reflect sales from June 1 to June 19. YTD sales, meanwhile, represent sales from the start of the year through to June 19.
The Bottom Line
YTD tells us how a monetary value has progressed since the beginning of the calendar or fiscal year. That could be an investment or group of investments, a company's accounting figure, such as sales or profit, or an employee’s earnings.
YTD is straightforward to calculate and allows for the monitoring of trends throughout the year rather than waiting for end-of-year figures. The results are highly influential and can impact how companies and investors invest, plan, and spend money.

Beta is a widely used indicator of the price volatility, or the level of risk, of a stock relative to the broader market.
What Is Beta?
Beta is an indicator of the price volatility of a stock or other asset in comparison with the broader market. It suggests the level of risk that an investor takes on in buying the stock. The higher the beta number, the higher the risk.
The market that the stock trades in, such as the S&P 500, always has a beta of 1.0. A number above one indicates that the stock's price swings more, up or down, than the market in general. A number below one indicates its price is more stable.
The current beta of any stock can usually be found on the summary page of its listing on any financial website or stock trading site.
Key Takeaways
Beta gets its name from the second letter of the Greek alphabet, the letter (β).
Conventional wisdom says that stocks with a higher degree of risk have a higher chance of outperforming the markets.
Investors who aim for a balanced portfolio might include both stocks that have a high beta and stocks that have a low beta.
Investopedia / Yurle Villegas
How Beta Works
A
beta
coefficient shows the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. Beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each point represents an individual stock's returns against the market.
Beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market. It is used in the
capital asset pricing model
(CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. CAPM is used to price risky securities and to estimate the expected returns of assets, considering the risk of those assets and the cost of capital.

Calculating Beta
A security's beta is calculated by dividing the product of the
covariance
of the security's returns and the market's returns by the
variance
of the market's returns over a specified period. The
calculation
helps investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. It also provides insights into how volatile—or how risky—a stock is relative to the rest of the market.
For beta to provide useful insight, the market used as a
benchmark should be related
to the stock. For example, a bond ETF's beta with the S&P 500 as the benchmark would not be helpful to an investor because bonds and stocks are too dissimilar.

Beta Values
Beta equal to 1:
A stock with a beta of 1.0 means its price activity correlates with the market. Adding a stock to a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 doesn’t add any risk to the portfolio, but it doesn’t increase the likelihood that the portfolio will provide an excess return.
Beta less than 1:
A beta value less than 1.0 means the security is less volatile than the market. Including this stock in a portfolio makes it less risky than the same portfolio without the stock. Utility stocks often have low betas because they move more slowly than market averages.
Beta greater than 1:
A beta greater than 1.0 indicates that the security's price is theoretically more volatile than the market. If a stock's beta is 1.2, it is assumed to be 20% more volatile than the market. Technology stocks tend to have higher betas than the market benchmark. Adding the stock to a portfolio will increase the portfolio’s risk, but may also increase its return.
Negative beta:
A beta of -1.0 means that the stock is inversely correlated to the market benchmark on a 1:1 basis.
Put options
and
inverse ETFs
are designed to have negative betas. There are also a few industry groups, like gold miners, where a negative beta is common.
How Investors Use Beta
An investor uses beta to gauge how much risk a stock adds to a portfolio. While a stock that deviates very little from the market doesn’t add a lot of risk to a portfolio, it also doesn’t increase the potential for greater returns.
Investors must ensure that a specific stock is compared to the right benchmark and review the R-squared value relative to the benchmark.
R-squared
is a statistical measure that compares the security's historical price movements to the benchmark index.
A security with a high R-squared value indicates a relevant benchmark. A gold
exchange-traded fund
(ETF), such as the SPDR Gold Shares (
GLD
), is tied to the performance of gold bullion. Consequently, a gold ETF would have a low beta and R-squared relationship with the S&P 500.
1
Investors commonly evaluate two categories of risk. Systematic risk is the risk of the entire market declining, also known as undiversifiable risk.
Unsystematic
, or diversifiable risk, is the uncertainty associated with an individual stock or industry. It is the risk related to a company or sector and can be mitigated through diversification.
Fast Fact
A stock's beta will change over time as it relates a stock's performance to the returns of the overall market.
Theory vs. Practice
The beta coefficient theory assumes that stock returns are normally distributed from a statistical perspective. In reality, returns aren’t always normally distributed. Therefore, what a stock's beta might predict about a stock’s future movement may prove untrue.
A stock with a very
low beta could have smaller price swings
, yet still be in a long-term downtrend. So, adding a down-trending stock with a low beta decreases the risk in a portfolio only if the investor defines risk strictly in terms of volatility and not potential losses.
Similarly, a high beta stock that is volatile in a mostly upward direction will increase the risk of a portfolio, but it may increase gains. Investors who use beta to evaluate a stock also evaluate it from other perspectives, such as fundamental or technical factors, before assuming it will add or remove risk from a portfolio.
Is Beta a Helpful Measure for Long-Term Investments?
While beta can offer useful information when evaluating a stock, it does have some limitations. Beta can determine a security's short-term risk and analyze volatility. However, beta is calculated using historical data points and is less meaningful for investors looking to predict a stock's future movements for long-term investments. A stock's volatility can change significantly over time, depending on a company's growth stage and other factors.
Is Beta a Good Measure of Risk?
Beta can provide some risk information, but it is not an effective measure of risk. Beta only looks at a stock's past performance relative to the S&P 500 and does not predict future moves. It also does not consider the fundamentals of a company or its earnings and growth potential.
How Do Investors Interpret a Stock's Beta?
A Beta of 1.0 for a stock means it has been as volatile as the broader market. If the index moves up or down 1%, so too would the stock, on average. Betas larger than 1.0 indicate greater volatility. So if the beta were 1.5 and the index moved up or down 1%, the stock would have moved 1.5%, on average. Betas less than 1.0 indicate less volatility; if the stock had a beta of 0.5, it would have risen or fallen just half a percent as the index moved 1%.
The Bottom Line
Beta (β) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet used to measure the volatility of a security or portfolio compared to the S&P 500, which has a beta of 1.0. A Beta of 1.0 shows that a stock has been as volatile as the broader market. Betas larger than 1.0 indicate greater volatility, and betas less than 1.0 indicate less volatility.

Definition
A holding company controls subsidiary firms through majority stock ownership.
A holding company is a parent company that owns and oversees other businesses. Instead of making products or providing services, it focuses on managing subsidiary businesses and brands while maintaining control through its voting stock. This allows the parent company to exercise control without participating in day-to-day operations.
Alphabet Inc. (
GOOGL
) is a holding company that owns Google and several other technology companies, such as Nest, Waymo, Deepmind, and Fitbit. While Google continues its operations in search, advertising, and other internet services, Alphabet manages the overall corporate strategy and assets across its portfolio of companies.
Key Takeaways
Holding companies own and control other businesses, providing centralized oversight.
Subsidiary companies are typically run by their own management teams.
Holding companies offer strategic flexibility and tax advantages through diversified investments and capital allocation.
There are different types of holding companies, from pure holding companies to mixed and financial models.
Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia
What Is a Holding Company?
Holding companies as we know them got their start during America's Industrial Revolution. Railroad magnates like J.P. Morgan pioneered this organizational model to consolidate control over various railway lines while maintaining separate operating entities.
1
Soon, Standard Oil and U.S. Steel used holding company structures to dominate entire sectors of the economy.
By owning
controlling stakes
in multiple companies, a parent firm could enjoy competitive advantages that would be impossible for a single firm. The approach gained added prominence during the trust-busting era of the early 20th century when companies sought legal ways to maintain scale and efficiency without running afoul of new
antitrust regulations
.
2
Here's how it works: The holding company buys enough shares (usually more than half) of other companies to call the shots on major decisions. This control doesn't require the holding company to engage in the daily operations of these businesses. Instead, the holding company sets strategic goals, appoints board members, and oversees major financial decisions. The parent company might also provide centralized services like financial management and legal counsel.
The subsidiaries often run independently, often retaining their own management teams to handle everyday business tasks. This division of labor allows the parent company to benefit from the performance of its subsidiaries without the need to manage operations.
A well-known holding company is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (
BRK.A
), led by the legendary investor
Warren Buffett
. Berkshire Hathaway has a broad portfolio of businesses, ranging from those in insurance to food and beverage to railroads.
3
Important
Businesses that are 100% owned by a holding company are called “
wholly owned subsidiaries
,"" while holding companies may also own smaller but controlling interests in other subsidiaries.
Types of Holding Companies
Pure holding
companies
are the simplest to understand because they do just one thing: own and manage other companies. They don't make anything or sell services themselves; they're just for running a family of companies.
Mixed holding companies
combine ownership of other companies with their own operational activities. For instance, Microsoft Corporation (
MSFT
) acts as an operating company producing software and services while holding significant ownership stakes and controlling interests in other technology companies.
Immediate holding companies
are like a direct parent. They own another company directly, with no middle management involved.
Intermediate holding companies
serve as middle-tier entities within larger corporate structures. Multinational organizations often use this structure to
save on taxes
and manage regional operations. Intermediates thus own local subsidiaries while being owned by a parent company.
Industry-specific
holding companies
focus on one industry they know well. For instance, in the media and entertainment sector,
Comcast Corporation
is a holding company for NBCUniversal, Xumo, SkyNews, and Telemundo.
Financial holding companies
, which are regulated differently from others, typically own multiple banking, financial, or insurance institutions.
Holding Companies vs. Conglomerates
A holding company is primarily a legal and financial structure that owns controlling interests in other companies, while a
conglomerate
typically implies operational involvement across diverse business lines. Many holding companies are conglomerates, but not all conglomerates organize themselves as pure holding companies.
Holding Company Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages
The holding company structure offers several unique advantages. First, it helps isolate risk, as each subsidiary has a separate legal status. If one company faces financial difficulties or legal challenges, the other subsidiaries and the parent company remain protected.
There are also major tax advantages to being a holding company. If one business loses money while another makes money, they can balance each other out, which usually means paying less in taxes overall. Let's say a holding company owns two businesses: a profitable restaurant chain and a new tech startup that's losing money while it gets off the ground. When tax time comes, it can use the startup's losses to reduce the taxes it would owe on the restaurant's profits.
A holding company can also redirect profits from cash-rich
subsidiaries
to fund growth opportunities in other units or acquire new businesses, which is less costly than obtaining outside funding.
In addition, holding companies might be able to negotiate better terms with suppliers or lenders by leveraging their combined size and resources.
Fast Fact
Pop culture loves poking fun at bizarre holding company combos. NBC's ""30 Rock"" had running jokes about
GE
(then NBC's actual holding company) and a fictional NBC being owned by the Sheinhardt Wig Company. ""Parks and Rec"" featured a hometown candy company called Sweetums that kept buying up shady firms of all sorts, eventually becoming Sweetum & Others. More recently, the company at the heart of HBO's ""Silicon Valley"" owned ""Gavin Belson's Side Projects,"" named after one of the firm's faux-visionary founders.
4
5
Disadvantages
One of the biggest headaches holding companies face is what Wall Street calls the ""
conglomerate discount
."" In plain English, this means investors often value holding companies less than they would if all their separate businesses stood alone.
6
Researchers have suggested several reasons for this proven phenomenon:
Money ends up in the wrong places
: When a holding company has lots of different businesses, it's like having several bank accounts but not being able to move money among them quickly enough. Maybe the furniture business needs cash right now to buy new equipment, but most of the company's money is tied up in the tech division. Even though the furniture purchase could bring great returns, the chance gets missed.
Jack of all trades, master of none
: The executives at the top might be great at running one type of business, but they probably aren't experts in every industry they oversee. Outsiders are often left wondering how a company can be equally good at running a candy company, an insurance firm, and a railroad, for example.
It's just too complicated
: Keeping track of how well each business is doing and ensuring they're all running at their best is like trying to watch 10 TV shows at once. Sometimes, important details get missed because there's just too much to monitor.
7
Regulatory compliance also becomes more complex, particularly for companies operating across multiple jurisdictions and industries. There might also be
conflicts of interest
between the holding company's objectives and individual subsidiaries, for which there might be other shareholders.

Investopedia,"Variability: Definition in Statistics and Finance, How to Measure","Close
Definition
Variability measures how the values in a dataset are clustered around their average value.
What Is Variability?
Variability measures how the points in a distribution diverge, or vary, from their mean value and each other. In finance, it is most often applied to the variability of investment returns.
Understanding the variability of investment returns is just as important to professional investors as the value of the returns themselves. Investors equate a high variability of returns to a higher degree of risk when investing.
Key Takeaways
Variability refers to the divergence of data from its mean value, and is commonly used in the statistical and financial sectors.
Variability in finance is most commonly applied to variability of returns, wherein investors prefer investments that have higher return with less variability.
Variability is used to standardize the returns obtained on an investment and provides a point of comparison for additional analysis.
Understanding Variability
Professional investors perceive the risk of an
asset class
to be directly proportional to the variability of its returns. As a result, investors demand a greater return from assets with higher variability of returns, such as stocks or commodities, than what they might expect from assets with lower variability of returns, such as Treasury bills.
This difference in expectation is also known as the
risk premium
. The risk premium refers to the amount required to motivate investors to place their money in higher-risk assets. If an asset displays a greater variability of returns but does not show a greater rate of return, investors will not be as likely to invest money in that asset.
Variability in statistics refers to the difference being exhibited by data points within a data set, as related to each other or as related to the mean. This can be expressed through the range, variance or standard deviation of a data set. The field of finance uses these concepts as they are specifically applied to price data and the returns that changes in price imply.
The range refers to the difference between the largest and smallest value assigned to the variable being examined. In statistical analysis, the range is represented by a single number. In financial data, this range is most commonly referring to the highest and lowest price value for a given day or another time period. The standard deviation is representative of the spread existing between price points within that time period, and the variance is the square of the standard deviation based on the list of data points in that same time period.
Variability in Investing
One measure of reward-to-variability is the
Sharpe ratio
, which measures the excess return or risk premium per unit of risk for an asset. In essence, the Sharpe ratio provides a metric to compare the amount of compensation an investor receives with regard to the overall risk being assumed by holding said investment. The excess return is based on the amount of return experienced beyond investments that are considered free of risk. All else being equal, the asset with the higher Sharpe ratio delivers more return for the same amount of risk.

Investopedia,High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI): Criteria and Example,"Close
Definition
A high-net-worth individual (HNWI) is generally defined as someone with more than $1 million in highly liquid assets.
What Is a High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI)?
A high-net-worth individual (HNWI) is someone with liquid assets of at least $1 million after accounting for their liabilities. Liquid assets held by HNWIs include cash and investments that can be easily liquidated or converted to cash, including stocks. HNWIs need and receive tailored financial and money management services due to their net worth.
Key Takeaways
A high-net-worth individual typically has at least $1 million in liquid financial assets.
North America had a record number of HNWIs, at 8.4 million people as of December 2024.
HNWIs can be subclassified based on their net worth, such as an ultra-high-net-worth individual with over $30 million in liquid assets.
Understanding High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)
High-net-worth individuals are people whose
net worth
meets a minimum threshold. While the amount often differs by financial institution and region, the generally accepted minimum is $1 million in liquid assets. This figure excludes the person’s primary residence and assets, such as fine art and antiques, which can be difficult to sell.
1
There are several ways to reach a high net worth. Working, saving, and making smart investments can lead to an increase in net worth. Other ways include inheriting a large sum, winning the lottery, selling a valuable asset or business, and receiving a settlement or life insurance payout.
HNWIs usually get more benefits than those whose net worth falls under $1 million. Most banks require customers to have a certain amount of liquid assets, a certain amount in depository accounts with the bank (or both) to qualify as an HNWI. If they do, they may get services with reduced fees, special rates, and access to investor events that are closed to most.
2
3
The more money a person has, the more work it takes to maintain and preserve those assets. These individuals may demand and can justify personalized investment management, estate planning, and tax planning services. They generally qualify for separately managed investment accounts rather than mutual funds.

Fast Fact
Their wealth allows high-net-worth individuals to participate in initial public offerings (IPOs) and invest in startups that demonstrate financial potential.
Types of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)
HNWIs can be divided into several different categories. Where they fall depends on how much they're worth:
Sub-HNWI:
An individual with more than $100,000 but less than $1 million
Very-HNWI:
An individual whose net worth is between $1 million and $5 million
Ultra-high-net-worth individual (UHNWI)
:
This is someone who has a net worth of at least $30 million.
Remember that a person's liquid assets are considered when calculating their net worth. As such, it excludes property like their primary residence, collectibles, and consumer durables.
Where Are Most High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)?
North America had the highest concentration of HNWIs at the end of 2024, with about 8.4 million, according to Capgemini. The Asia-Pacific region followed with 7.6 million individuals. HNWIs in Europe totaled 5.7 million, while those in Latin America numbered 600,000. The Middle East had 900,000 HNWIs, and Africa had 200,000.
The total number of HNWIs worldwide increased by 2.6% from 2023 to the end of 2024, with North America experiencing the largest increase of 7.3%. The HNWI population had a total of $90.5 trillion in wealth.
4
The management consulting firm Capgemini separates the HNWI population into three wealth bands:
5
Millionaires next door, who have $1 million to $5 million in investable wealth
Mid-tier millionaires, with $5 million to $30 million to invest
Ultra-HNWIs, who have more than $30 million
Globally, the ultra-HNWI population numbered 234,000 in 2024. That’s an increase of 6.3% from 2023. Mid-tier millionaires numbered 2.16 million, while the millionaires next door category made up the largest group, at 21.02 million.
6
Benefits Afforded to High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)
The benefits for high-net-worth individuals vary by financial institution and region. As an HNWI, you may qualify for banking, investment, and other financial services with reduced fees, discounts, and special rates, along with access to special events and perks.
HNWIs can invest in hedge funds, which are generally open only to accredited investors who meet certain criteria, including a minimum net worth. HNWIs may also invest in private equity (PE) and
venture capital (VC)
funds, which are not available to the general public.
How Are HNWIs Categorized?
The most commonly quoted figure for qualification as a high-net-worth individual is at least $1 million in liquid financial assets, excluding personal assets such as a
primary residence
. Investors who have a net worth between $100,000 and $1 million in liquid assets are considered sub-HNWIs. Very-high-net-worth individuals have investable assets of at least $5 million, while ultra-high-net-worth individuals have at least $30 million in investable assets.
What Benefits Do HNWIs Get?
HNWIs are highly sought-after clients for wealth managers. They generally qualify for personalized managed investment accounts instead of regular mutual funds. They also qualify for estate planning, tax planning, and portfolio management services.
Where Are Most of the High-Net-Worth Individuals?
North America leads the pack with 8.4 million HNWIs, followed by the Asia-Pacific region with 7.6 million, and Europe with 5.7 million.
4
The Bottom Line
A high-net-worth individual has liquid assets of at least $1 million. These individuals often seek the assistance of financial professionals to manage their money, and their high net worth qualifies them for additional benefits and investing opportunities that aren't available to most. HNWIs are in high demand by private wealth managers because it takes more work to maintain and preserve their assets.

The quadruple witching hour is the last sixty minutes of the trading day on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December when contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously.
What Is Quadruple Witching?
""Quadruple witching"" refers to the simultaneous expiration four times a year of stock options, index futures, and index futures options derivatives contracts. The fourth type of contract involved in quadruple witching, single-stock futures, hasn't traded in the U.S. since 2020 and was never a major contributor to equity trading volumes.
1
What is now effectively ""triple witching"" occurs on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Equity trading volume tends to rise on these days and is typically heaviest during the last hour of trading as traders adjust their portfolios.
Key Takeaways
Quadruple witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures derivatives contracts four times a year.
Quadruple witching has given way to triple witching since single stock futures stopped trading in the U.S. in 2020.
This event occurs once every quarter, on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.
Trading volume typically surges on triple witching days as traders adjust portfolios and roll some contracts.
Triple witching does not usually cause increased market volatility.

Dec. 18
During the last hour of trading on these days, known as the quadruple witching hour, market activity might increase as traders adjust positions and roll over contracts.
Understanding Quadruple Witching
The four
derivatives
contracts accounting for the 'quadruple' in quadruple witching are stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures. While single stock futures now only trade outside the U.S., the quarterly expiration of index futures and index options, coinciding with the monthly expiration of stock options, produces a flurry of trading.
Despite the evocative name, what happens during what is now
triple witching
is not a supernatural phenomenon nor a mystery. Market makers who've sold expiring stock and index options contracts close out the matched hedge positions, boosting trading volume. Meanwhile, the rolling of contracts ahead of expiration also increases turnover in the options and futures markets.
Another factor is quarterly index rebalancing, also known as
reconstitution
, on the ""witching"" day. That means portfolio managers tracking rebalancing indexes, including those from S&P Dow Jones in the U.S. and FTSE in the U.K., may need to trade reflecting index changes.
Types of Contracts Involved in Quadruple Witching
Now that you know what quadruple witchings are all about, let's take a look at the four classes of contracts that can expire on these dates.
Stock Options
Options
are derivatives, which means they derive their value from underlying securities such as stocks. Options contracts give a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to trade a set number of shares of the underlying security at a given strike price at any time before options expire.
There are two types of options:
A call option may be bought to speculate on a price increase in a particular stock. If the share price is higher than the strike price on the option's expiration date, the investor can exercise the option to buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price and resell them at the higher market price or may simply sell the option at a profit before expiration.
A put option lets an investor profit from a decline in a stock's share price, as long as the price is below the strike at expiration.
Monthly stock options contracts expire on the third Friday of every month. Option buyers pay an upfront cost known as the
option premium
.
2
Index Options
An
index option
works much like a stock options contract, but derives its value from that of an equity index rather than a single stock's share price. The value of the underlying index relative to the option contract's strike price is what determines an index option trade's profitability. As with stock options, index options don't confer an ownership interest.
3
Unlike stock options, index options are cash-settled. Another important distinction is that index options are
European-style
, meaning they can only be exercised on expiration date, while stock options may be exercised at any time before expiration.
3
Index Futures
Futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell an asset at a determined price at a specified future date.
4
Futures contracts are standardized with fixed quantities and expiration dates. Futures trade on a futures exchange. The buyer of a futures contract is obligated to buy the underlying asset at expiry while the seller is obligated to sell at expiry.
Index futures cash settle at expiration at the specified price, with the value of the index at the time determining the trade's profitability.
5
Like index options, index futures can be used to hedge a portfolio of stocks, limiting the damage from bear markets.
In a bear market, a trade selling a futures contract earns a profit, offsetting the stock portfolio's loss. The goal is to minimize short-term losses for long-term holdings.
Single Stock Futures
Single stock futures are obligations to take delivery of shares of the underlying stock at the contract's expiration date at a specified price. Each contract represents 100 shares of stock. Holders of stock futures don't receive
dividend
payments.
6
Even when single-stock futures traded in the U.S. they were a minor market segment relative to the trading flows in stock options and index options and futures.
Market Impact of Quadruple Witching
One reason the combination of monthly and quarterly derivatives expirations generates heavy trading volume is that
in-the-money
options contracts are subject to automatic exercise, requiring the delivery of the underlying shares in the case of call options.
Call options are profitable when the price of the underlying security is higher than the option's strike price. Put options are in-the-money when the stock is priced below the strike price. In either case, the expiration of in-the-money options results in increased trading volume as the underlying shares are bought or sold to close out the options trade.
7
Despite the overall increase in trading volume, quadruple witching days do not necessarily add to market
volatility
.
Fast Fact
While quadruple witching takes place four times a year, stock options contracts expire more frequently—on the third Friday of every month.
Closing and Rolling out Futures Contracts
Much of the action surrounding futures and options on quadruple witching days is focused on offsetting, closing, or rolling out positions. A futures contract contains an agreement between the buyer and seller in which the underlying security is to be delivered to the buyer at the contract price at expiration.
For example, one
E-mini S&P 500
futures contract is worth 50 times the value of the S&P 500.
8
So the value of an E-mini contract when the S&P 500 is 2,100 at expiration is $105,000. This amount is delivered to the contract owner if it is left open at expiration.
Contract owners don't have to take delivery on the expiration date. Instead, they can close their contracts by booking an offsetting trade at the prevailing price by cash settling the gain or loss from the purchase and sale prices. Traders can also
roll their contracts forward
, a process that extends the contract by offsetting the existing trade and simultaneously booking a new option or futures contract to be settled in the future.

What Is the Jones Act?
The Jones Act is a federal law that regulates
maritime
commerce in the United States. The Jones Act requires goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported on ships that are built, owned, and operated by United States citizens or permanent residents.
The Jones Act is Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which provided for the maintenance of the American merchant marine.
1
Key Takeaways
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act, is a protectionist law that regulates maritime shipping in the United States.
The Jones Act requires that any cargo traveling by sea between two U.S. ports must sail on an American-owned ship, built in the United States and with a majority crew of U.S. citizens.
The Jones Act was passed in the wake of the first World War to boost the shipping industry.
Critics say that the Jones Act increases the cost of shipping for U.S. islands like Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
Understanding the Jones Act
The Jones Act was introduced by Wesley Jones, the U.S. Senator from the state of Washington, who designed the legislation to give his state a monopoly on shipping to Alaska. It was enacted by the United States Congress to stimulate the shipping industry in the wake of World War I.
2
Considered protectionist legislation, the Jones Act focuses on issues related to maritime commerce, including cabotage or the transport of people or goods between ports in the same country.
The Act requires that goods shipped between
U.S. ports
be transported on ships built, owned, and operated by United States citizens or permanent residents. This provision and its restrictions increase the cost of shipping to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other non-continental U.S. lands that rely on imports.

Important
The Jones Act is a piece of protectionist legislation that considerably increases the costs of shipping goods between two U.S. ports.
Goals of the Jones Act
Launched to revitalize the U.S. maritime shipping industry, which had been depleted after World War I.
Support the shipping industry and prevent the United States from relying on foreign-built ships.
Generate jobs and business revenue. The Jones Act supports 650,000 American jobs, generating $150 billion in economic activity each year.
4
Jones Act Requirements
Ships transporting cargo between two U.S. ports must be owned by U.S.-based companies, with over 75% of the ownership stake held by U.S. citizens.
A ship's crew must consist of a majority of U.S. citizens.
The ships must be built and registered in the U.S.
5
Jones Act Waivers
In the wake of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, the Act may be waived to increase the number of ships that can legally supply goods to an affected area.
6
The Secretary of Defense can request waivers in the ""interest of national defense"" and there is a separate procedure for non-defense entities. In both cases, the final authority for a waiver is the Secretary of Homeland Security.
7
Criticism of the Jones Act
The Jones Act has been cited as a factor affecting Puerto Rico's economic and budgetary troubles by affecting trade with the island. A 2019 report found that for Puerto Rico ""the differentials between U.S. and foreign-flagged carriers range from about 41% to as high as 62% for bulk cargo and between 29% and 89% for containerized freight.” The additional costs caused by the Act for the island’s economy to be nearly $1.2 billion, which comes to roughly $374 per resident.
8
The waiver of the Act was implemented in 2022 only after Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico. The Biden administration allowed a non-U.S. flagged ship to transport fuel to Puerto Rico, following pressure to waive the rule in the face of a fuel shortage to ensure that citizens could run generators needed for electricity and the functioning critical facilities.
9
Opponents hope that a repeal of the Act will result in decreased shipping costs, lower prices, and less strain on government budgets. Proponents of the act include states with owners of navy yards, defense firms, and shipping industries, as well as the longshoremen and other personnel who work in ports.
In early 2022, the Jones Act made headlines for its potential role in the U.S.-Russia oil business. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, the U.S. banned Russian oil and gas imports on March 8.
10
The U.S. has traditionally relied on imports from Russia, especially Hawaii, which imports Russian crude oil per year, accounting for up to a quarter of all Russian oil shipments to the U.S. Critics of the Jones Act suggest that it limits the viability of shipping oil and gas to remote areas like Hawaii, forcing the state to rely on imports from Russia.
11
How Does the Jones Act Affect Puerto Rico?
One consequence of the Jones Act is that it requires U.S. shipping for cargo between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland, increasing the cost of development for the island's economy.
5
How Does the Jones Act Affect Cruise Ships?
While the Jones Act does not cover passenger vessels, a related law has a similar effect on cruise ships. Under the 1886 Passenger Vessel Services Act, a foreign ship cannot transport passengers directly between two U.S. ports.
12
This means that a foreign-flagged cruise ship (the vast majority of cruise ships) must include foreign ports in any itinerary that begins and ends in a U.S. port. This often results in confusion or even fines for passengers who disembark at ports that violate the Jones Act.
How Long Can a Waiver of the Jones Act Be Implemented?
In 2020, Congress eliminated the federal government’s authority to issue long-term waivers, except in circumstances where a waiver is required to “address an immediate adverse effect on military operations.” Waivers that do not meet that standard must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
9
The Bottom Line
The Jones Act is a 1920 law that limits how cargo is transported by sea. It requires any cargo shipped between U.S. ports to be carried by U.S. ships, with American crews. Originally intended as a measure to support the strategically-important shipping industry, it is now considered a classic example of protectionism.

A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate and sells shares to raise capital to do so.
What Is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)?
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate across a wide range of property sectors. These investments allow you to earn
income
from
real estate
without having to buy, manage, or finance properties themselves.
Created by a 1960 law, REITs were designed to make real estate investing more accessible so smaller
investors
could invest in a portfolio of skyscrapers, shopping malls, or apartment complexes with the same ease as buying stocks. By pooling capital from many investors, REITs have changed and funded much of American real estate, often in ways few in the public understand. Below, we’ll explore how they work, what benefits and risks you need to know about, and how to invest in them.
Key Takeaways
REITs own, run, use, work, or finance income-producing properties.
REITs generate a steady income stream for investors but offer little capital appreciation.
Most REITs are publicly traded like stocks, which makes them highly liquid, unlike traditional real estate investments.
A sizeable minority of REITs are private funds whose shares are only eligible to accredited investors.
REITs invest in apartment buildings, cell towers, data centers, hotels, medical facilities, offices, retail centers, and warehouses.
Eliana Rodgers / Investopedia
How REITs Work
Congress established REITs in 1960 through an amendment to the Cigar Excise Tax Extension.
1
The provision enabled firms to pool capital from investors to buy large
real estate portfolios
.
2
REITs operate like mutual funds—firms manage pools of funds for the sake of many investors—but for real estate instead of stocks and bonds. Investors earn returns in two ways: from dividends or an increase in the value of the REIT’s shares.
3
Central to REITs is that they take the quintessential example of illiquid assets—real estate—and make them liquid. REITs invest in all kinds of properties: apartment complexes, data centers, healthcare facilities, hotels, infrastructure (fiber cables, cell towers, and energy pipelines), office buildings, retail centers, self-storage units, timberland, and warehouses. REITs tend to specialize in specific real estate sectors, like commercial properties. However, many hold diversified portfolios of many kinds of properties.
4
As you can see below, the amount investors have pooled in REITs has risen significantly in the past quarter century—almost exactly tenfold. Also notable is the undulation of the line graph as market bubbles inflate, crises and recessions arrive, and interest rates shift. Often thought of as the most stable of stock assets—after all, the sector includes the ground beneath your feet—the value of real estate and, thus, the returns from REITs are certainly not.
What Qualifies As a REIT?
Most REITs lease space, collect rent on properties, and distribute that income as dividends to shareholders. A small percentage of REITs, called mortgage REITs, earn money from financing real estate, not owning it. In the mid-2020s, they account for about 4% of REIT assets in the United States.
To qualify as a REIT, a company must meet several requirements set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
5
These include the following:
Invest at least 75% of total assets in real estate, cash, or U.S. Treasurys
Derive at least 75% of gross income from rent, interest on mortgages that finance real estate, or real estate sales
Pay a minimum of 90% of their taxable income to their shareholders through dividends
Be a taxable corporation
Be managed by a board of directors or trustees
Have a minimum of 100 shareholders
Have no more than 50% of its shares held by five or fewer individuals
Fast Fact
An example of a REIT is Healthpeak Properties Inc. (
DOC
), an S&P 500 company that owns, manages, and develops healthcare real estate.
6
In mid-2024, it had a market capitalization of almost $15 billion, with 2023 profits of almost $1.3 billion.
7
What Are the Types of REITs?
While REITs are categorized by the different kinds of properties they invest in, there have traditionally been three major types:
Equity REITs.
Most REITs are equity-based and own and manage income-producing real estate. Revenues are generated primarily through rent, not by reselling properties.
Mortgage REITs.
Mortgage REITs lend money to real estate owners and operators directly through mortgages and loans or indirectly through acquiring
mortgage-backed securities
. Their earnings are generated primarily by the net interest margin—the spread between the interest they earn on mortgage loans and the cost of funding these loans. This model makes them sensitive to interest rate increases—though equity REITs are also greatly affected by rate change.
Hybrid REITs.
These REITs mix strategies from both equity and mortgage REITs. After the
2007–2008 financial crisis
, these trusts, already on the wane, largely disappeared as regulations changed and REITs became more, not less, specialized.

How to Invest in REITs
Within the above types are REITs that have different ways of attracting funding. These differences will be important when we next go through our tips for how to begin investing in REITs:
Publicly traded REITs.
Shares of publicly traded REITs are listed on a public exchange, where they are bought and sold by individual investors. These fall under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.
9
Public non-traded REITs.
These REITs are registered with the SEC but don’t trade on exchanges. As a result, they are less liquid than publicly traded REITs.
9
As such, they tend to be more stable because they’re not subject to market volatility. Shares of a non-traded REIT can be bought through a broker or financial advisor who participates in the non-traded REIT’s offering.
Private REITs.
These REITs aren’t registered with the SEC and don’t trade on securities exchanges. In general, private REITs can be sold only to institutional investors. They are also the site of many REIT-related frauds.
10
While most, of course, are legitimate investments, it’s easier for con artists to ply their trade in this area of real estate than within the regulated markets.
In addition, REITs may be included in
defined benefit
and
defined contribution
plans through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Thus, many U.S. investors own shares in REITs through their retirement savings.
$4.0 trillion
As of 2024, REITs own more than $4.0 trillion in commercial real estate. About 63% of these assets are owned by publicly traded trusts.
11
Tips on Starting to Invest in REITs
If you’re new to REIT investing, here are
tips to get you started
:
1. Begin with Publicly Traded REITs
For newcomers, publicly traded REITs offer the easiest way to get started. You don’t need a vast amount of money—the cost of entry is the trust’s share price that interests you. Private REITs, meanwhile, are only open to
accredited investors
and have minimums starting in the low thousands.
When investing in publicly traded REITs, here are strategies to consider:
Do your homework
: Examine a REIT’s portfolio, management team, debt levels, and dividend history before investing.
Think of the long-term
: REITs are customarily best suited for long-term strategies because of how they generate income.
Examine the fees
: There are no direct fees beyond standard brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares. REIT management fees are built into operating expenses, affecting your overall returns. As such, you’ll want to review how comparatively efficient the trust is with managing its expenses—that is, your fees.
Tip
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has repeatedly warned investors about fraud in the sector, showing how many REIT scams involve “REITs” that are anything but: They don’t own real estate, aren’t invested in anything, and aren’t trusts or to be trusted.
10
2. Start Small and Scale Up
It’s prudent to begin with a
modest allocation
and gradually increase your exposure over time. You might begin by investing a small percentage of your portfolio—perhaps 2% to 5%—in a broadly diversified REIT or REIT fund. You can then take the time to get fam",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp
Investopedia,W-4 Form,"Close
What Is a W-4 Form?
Form W-4 is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form that is filled out by employees to indicate their tax situation to their employer. The W-4 form
tells the employer
the amount of tax to withhold from an employee's paycheck based on their marital status, number of allowances and dependents, and other factors. The W-4 is also called an Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate.
1
﻿
Key Takeaways
Employees fill out a W-4 form to let employers know how much tax to withhold from their paycheck based on the employee's marital status, number of exemptions and dependents, etc.
Increasing the number of allowances on the form decreases the amount of money withheld from the paycheck.
Taxpayers can file a new W-4 any time their situation changes, such as when they marry, divorce, or have a child. A change in status can result in more or less tax being withheld.
Understanding the W-4 Form
The employee fills out seven lines on the
W-4 form
. The first few lines include the
taxpayer's
name, address, and Social Security number. A worksheet included with the form lets taxpayers estimate the number of allowances on their tax withholding. Increasing the number of allowances reduces the amount of money withheld from the paycheck. A person can claim an exemption from withholding any money if they did not have a liability during the previous year and expect to have zero tax liability in the next year.
2
﻿
The accompanying worksheet to the
W-4 form
starts by letting taxpayers add one allowance if they cannot be claimed as a dependent on someone else's income tax return. Employees can take another allowance if they are single and have just one job, are married with one job and the spouse doesn't work or have wages from a second job within the family totaling less than $1,500.
Important
On Jan. 1, 2018, the personal exemption federal tax break was suspended until Jan. 1, 2026, in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
On the next line of the worksheet—line E for the
child tax credit
—employees can claim allowances for each of their eligible children, depending on income earned and how many children they have.
The following line—line F for credit for other dependents—asks employees to enter allowances for other dependents that will be claimed on their tax return. IRS Publication 501 spells out who qualifies as a dependent. There are income limitations for credit in this section.
3
Those looking to apply other credits, such as the
earned income credit
(EITC), will fill out line G. To see if you may be entitled to additional allowances see
Worksheets 1-6 in IRS Publication 505
. On the final line, line H, add up all the numbers from the previous lines and enter the total.
The worksheet also has additional pages for more complex tax situations, such as
itemizing deductions
on your tax return instead of taking the standard deduction.
The employer then calculates how much to withhold from a paycheck based on the allowances calculated on the W-4 form. The money withheld goes to the IRS after each paycheck.
Special Considerations for the W-4 Form
Taxpayers can file a new W-4 at any time—and should do so whenever their situation changes, such as when they marry, divorce, have a child, or when a dependent dies. A change in status can result in the employer withholding more or less tax. As well, the elimination of the personal exemption for tax years 2018 through 2025 could change the number of allowances that should be taken.

Investopedia,"Onerous Contract: Definition, Accounting Rules, Examples","Close
What Is an Onerous Contract?
An onerous contract is an accounting term that refers to a contract that will cost a company more to fulfill than what the company will receive in return.
The term is used in many countries worldwide, where international regulators have determined that such contracts must be accounted for on balance sheets. The United States has a different system, based on
generally accepted accounting principles
, or GAAP, as set forth by the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Key Takeaways
An onerous contract is an accounting term defined under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), used in many countries around the world.
Companies that follow those standards are required to report any onerous contracts they're committed to on their balance sheets.
In the United States, companies typically follow a different set of accounting standards and generally don't have to account for their onerous contracts.
Understanding Onerous Contracts
The International Accounting Standards (IAS) defines an onerous contract as ""a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.""
1
﻿
The term ""unavoidable costs"" also has a specific meaning for accounting purposes. The IAS defines it as ""the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.""
1
﻿
Onerous Contract Example
An example of an onerous contract might be an agreement to rent a property that is no longer needed or that can no longer be made use of profitably. For instance, suppose a company signs a multiyear agreement to rent office space, then moves or downsizes while the agreement is still in effect, leaving the office space, which it now has no use for, vacant. Or consider a mining company that has signed a lease to mine for coal or some other commodity on a piece of land, but at some point during the term of the contract, the price of that commodity falls to a level that makes extracting it and bringing it to market unprofitable.
Special Considerations
The rules for how onerous contracts should be treated in a company's financial statements are part of the
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), for which the IAS Board is the independent standard-setting body. The governing body, the IFRS Foundation, is a not-for-profit organization based in London.
2
﻿
International Accounting Standard 37 (IAS 37), ""Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets,"" classifies onerous contracts as ""provisions,"" meaning liabilities or debts that will accrue at an uncertain time or in an unknown amount. Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the expenses required to satisfy the current obligation.
3
﻿
Under IAS 37, any business or company that identifies a contract as onerous is required to recognize the current obligation as a liability and to list that liability on its balance sheet. This process is meant to be undertaken at the first indication that the company expects a loss from the contract.
1
﻿
The IFRS and IASB standards are used by companies in many countries throughout the world, although not in the United States. The U.S. requires companies to follow another set of standards under GAAP. Under GAAP, losses, obligations, and debts on committed onerous contracts typically are not recognized or dealt with. However, the FASB has been working with the IASB to establish compatible standards worldwide.

Investopedia,"Demonetization: Meaning, Example, and How It Works","Close
What Is Demonetization?
Demonetization is the act of stripping a
currency
unit of its status as
legal tender
. It occurs whenever there is a change in
national currency
. The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with a new currency.
Key Takeaways
Demonetization is a drastic intervention into the economy that involves removing the legal tender status of a currency.
Demonetization can cause chaos or a serious downturn in an economy if it goes wrong.
Demonetization has been used as a tool to stabilize the currency and fight inflation, facilitate trade and access to markets, and push informal economic activity into more transparency and away from black and gray markets.
A famous example of demonetization occurred in 2016 when India demonetized 86% of its nation's currency.
1
Demonetized may also refer to social media or digital content that formerly qualified for revenue distribution but has since been denied income proceeds.
Understanding Demonetization
Removing the legal tender status of a unit of currency is a drastic intervention into an economy because it directly affects the medium of exchange used in all economic transactions. It can help stabilize existing problems, or it can cause chaos in an economy, especially if undertaken suddenly or without warning. That said, demonetization is undertaken by nations for a number of reasons.
Demonetization has been used to stabilize the value of a currency or combat
inflation
. The Coinage Act of 1873 demonetized
silver
as the legal tender of the United States, in favor of fully adopting the
gold standard
, in order to stave off disruptive inflation as large new silver deposits were discovered in the American West. Several coins, including a two-cent piece, three-cent piece, and half-dime were discontinued.
The withdrawal of silver from the economy resulted in a contraction of the
money supply
, which contributed to a recession throughout the country.
2
In response to the recession and political pressure from farmers and from silver miners and refiners, the Bland-Allison Act remonetized silver as legal tender in 1878.
3
In a more modern example, the Zimbabwean government demonetized its dollar in 2015 as a way to combat the country’s hyperinflation. At its peak, Zimbabwe's hyperinflation reached month-over-month growth of 79.6 million percent growth and year-over-year growth of 89.7 sextillion percent.
4
The three-month process involved expunging the Zimbabwean dollar from the country’s financial system and solidifying the
U.S. dollar,
the
Botswana pula
, and the
South African rand
as the country’s legal tender in a bid to stabilize the economy.
5
Some countries have demonetized currencies in order to facilitate trade or form currency unions. An example of demonetization for trade purposes occurred when the nations of the
European Union
officially began to use the
euro
as their everyday currencies in 2002. When the physical euro bills and coins were introduced, the old national currencies, such as the
German mark
, the
French franc
, and the Italian lira were demonetized. However, these varied currencies remained convertible into Euros at
fixed exchange rates
for a while to assure a smooth transition.
6
Important
The opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender.
Pros and Cons of Demonetization
There are several advantages when a nation demonetizes its currency. Fraudulent financial practices may be minimized as individuals will be unable to exchange illegal tender with banks. This also includes the potential reduction in tax evasion, pumping additional revenue into a nation's economy.
Demonetizing physical paper tender also demonstrates an advancing banking system, as
digital currency
can be more accessible, safer to store, and easier to transfer ownership. Organized industries and companies often benefit the greatest due to an easier transition.
Demonetization isn't without its faults. It's inconvenient for the nation's citizens and may be confusing when only select denominations are phased out over time. As a result of the disturbance, a nation's economy may temporarily experience a period of stalled growth in the short-term as the demonetization process occurs.
There are costly logistical measures to be taken as well. ATMs and other means of disbursing cash must be modified and recoded. Consumer prices must be reframed to ensure proper change can be given if needed. Daily wage earners—often among the poorest with no to minimal
savings
—may continue to be paid in defunct tender and must miss work to exchange their earnings with a bank.
Demonetization
Pros
Often results in decreased tax evasion and increased tax revenue
Ofte nresults in higher long-term GDP due to higher tax revenue being reinvested in the nation
Fosters innovation by converting currency to digital currency and promoting digital transactions
Reduces overall crime by enhancing transparency and discouraging the circulation of black money.
Cons
Imposes a burden on citizens, especially those who must convert one currency to another
Likely stalls a nation's GDP during the conversion process
Incurs expensive administrative costs including printing, adjusting ATMs, and marketing the changes.
Negatively impacts and even stops cash-driven sectors
Introduces new types of currency risk such as cybercrime
Demonetization Example in India
Lastly, demonetization has been tried as a tool to modernize a cash-dependent developing economy and to combat corruption and crime (counterfeiting,
tax evasion
). In 2016, the Indian government decided to demonetize the 500- and 1000- rupee notes, the two biggest denominations in its currency system; these notes accounted for 86% of the country’s circulating cash.
With little warning, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to the citizenry on Nov. 8, 2016, that those notes were worthless, effective immediately—and they had until the end of the year to deposit or exchange them for newly introduced 2000 rupee and 500 rupee bills.
7
8
Indian Rupee: Value in Dollars
Chaos ensued in the cash-dependent economy (some 78% of all Indian customer transactions are in cash), as long, snaking lines formed outside
ATMs
and
banks
, which had to shut down for a day. The new rupee notes have different specifications, including size and thickness, requiring re-calibration of ATMs: only 60% of the country’s 200,000 ATMs were operational. Even those dispensing bills of lower denominations faced shortages. The government’s restriction on daily withdrawal amounts added to the misery, though a waiver on
transaction fees
did help a bit. Severe cash shortages were recurring even through 2018.
9
Small businesses and households struggled to find cash and reports of daily wage workers not receiving their dues surfaced. The rupee fell sharply against the dollar.
The government’s goal (and rationale for the abrupt announcement) was to combat India's thriving
underground economy
on several fronts: eradicate counterfeit currency, fight tax evasion (only 1% of the population pays taxes), eliminate
black money
gained from
money laundering
, and terrorist financing activities, and to promote a cashless economy.
1
Individuals and entities with huge sums of black money gotten from parallel cash systems were forced to take their large-denomination notes to a bank, which was by law required to acquire
tax
information on them. If the owner could not provide proof of making any tax payments on the cash, a penalty of 200% of the owed amount was imposed.
10
Other Uses of Demonetization
Demonetization can also refer to the business practice of denying payment and is often experienced related to social media. Demonetization happens when a platform's content creator used to receive payment but due to underlying changes in the platform are no longer eligible. This may occur due to a terms and conditions violation or due to changes in the platform's
algorithms
that determine which creators are eligible to earn revenue.
Although used in an entirely different context, this form of demonetization is similar to the form of discontinuing legal tender. For both, an asset once held value but due to underlying changes in the nature of the asset, it no longer holds any monetary value.
Why Would a Country Demonetize?
Demonetization has been used to stabilize the value of a currency or combat inflation. Some countries have demonetized currencies in order to facilitate trade or form currency unions. Lastly, demonetization has been tried as a tool to modernize a cash-dependent developing economy and to combat corruption and crime (counterfeiting, tax evasion).
What Are the Advantages of Demonetization?
The main benefit of demonetization is to curtail criminal activity as their supply of money is no longer legal tender. This affects counterfeiters as well as they cannot exchange their ""merchandise"" for fear of discovery. It can prevent tax evasion as those who were evading taxes must come forward to exchange their existing currency at which time the authorities can retroactively tax them. Finally, it can usher in the digital currency age by slowing down the circulation of physical currency.
What Are the Disadvantages of Demonetization?
The chief disadvantage is the costs involved in printing and minting the new currency. Also, demonetization may not have the intended effect of reducing criminal activity as these entities might be savvy enough to hold assets in other forms other than physical currency. Finally, this process is risky as it can plunge the nation into utter chaos if not handled with the utmost of competence.
How Does Demonetization Impact GDP?
In the short-term, demonetization usually stunts economic growth and causes GDP to decline. During the conversion process, many industries and sectors may temporarily come to a halt",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demonetization.asp

What Is a Code of Ethics?
A code of ethics is a set of principles intended to guide professionals in conducting business with honesty and integrity. A code of ethics document may outline the organization’s mission and values, guide on addressing problems, establish ethical principles based on the organization’s core values, and define the standards to which professionals are held.
To evaluate corporate codes of ethics ethically, you must apply universal moral standards like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship to the stages of content, creation, implementation, and administration.
1
Also called an “ethical code,” a code of ethics may encompass areas such as
business ethics
, professional practices, and employee conduct.
Key Takeaways
A code of ethics outlines an organization’s guidelines and best practices for maintaining honesty, integrity, and professionalism.
Violating the code of ethics can lead to sanctions, including termination, for organization employees or members.
Specific laws regulate business conduct in some industries, including banking and finance, while in others, a code of ethics is voluntarily adopted.
The main types of codes of ethics include compliance-based, value-based, and professional codes of ethics.
Addressing climate change has become a key component of companies’ codes of ethics, highlighting their commitment to sustainability.
Joules Garcia / Investopedia
What Is the Purpose of a Code of Ethics?
Business ethics refers to how ethical principles guide a business’s operations. Common issues that fall under the umbrella of business ethics include employer-employee relations, discrimination, environmental issues, bribery,
insider trading
, and social responsibility.
Although many laws establish basic ethical standards for businesses, it’s primarily up to business leaders to develop a comprehensive code of ethics.
Ethical conduct has been shown to benefit an organization and society in the long term. It aligns with the
triple bottom line
theory of profit, people, and planet and meets the growing expectations of socially responsible customers, employees, and investors.
2
Businesses and trade organizations usually have a code of ethics that employees or members must follow. Violating this code can lead to termination or dismissal. A code of ethics is crucial because it clearly defines the rules for behavior and offers a basis for preemptive warnings.
Important
While a code of ethics is often not required, many firms and organizations adopt one to identify and characterize their business to
stakeholders
. This can build trust, ensure accountability, and demonstrate a commitment to ethical behavior, all of which can improve a company’s reputation and contribute to its success.
Given the importance of climate change and the significant impact of human behavior, many companies now include climate factors in their code of ethics. These principles outline the company’s dedication to operating sustainably or their plans to shift toward sustainable practices.
Although this commitment to
sustainability
can increase costs, it often proves worthwhile as consumers increasingly prefer to engage with environmentally responsible businesses, enhancing the company’s public image.
Regardless of size, businesses count on their management staff to set ethical conduct standards for other employees. When leaders adhere to the code of ethics, universal compliance is expected, with no exceptions.
Types of Codes of Ethics
A code of ethics can take various forms. Still, its general goal is to ensure that a business and its employees follow state and federal laws, conduct themselves according to exemplary standards, and benefit all stakeholders. Here are two types of codes of ethics commonly found in business.
Compliance-Based Code of Ethics
For all businesses, laws regulate issues such as hiring and safety standards. Compliance-based codes of ethics set guidelines for conduct and determine penalties for violations.
Specific laws govern business conduct in industries like banking, leading these sectors to adopt compliance-based codes of ethics to enforce regulations. Employees typically undergo formal training to understand these rules. Noncompliance can create legal issues for the company, and individual employees may face penalties for failing to follow guidelines.
Some companies appoint a
compliance officer
to ensure adherence to the code of ethics. This individual stays updated on regulatory changes and monitors employee conduct to encourage conformity.
This type of code of ethics is based on
clear-cut rules
and defined consequences rather than personal behavior monitoring. While it ensures legal compliance, it may not always promote a climate of moral responsibility within a company.
Value-Based Code of Ethics
A value-based code of ethics addresses a company’s core value system, setting
standards of responsible conduct
that benefit the larger public and the environment. These ethical codes often require more self-regulation than compliance-based codes.
Some codes of conduct contain language that addresses both compliance and values.  For example, a grocery store chain might create a code prioritizing health and safety regulations over financial gain. Additionally, the code might include a commitment to avoiding
suppliers
that use hormones in livestock or raise animals in inhumane conditions.
Code of Ethics in Different Professions
Certain professions, such as those in finance or health, have specific laws that mandate codes of ethics and conduct.
Accountants
Certified public accountants (CPAs)
, who are not typically considered fiduciaries to their clients, still are expected to follow similar ethical standards, such as integrity, objectivity, truthfulness, and avoidance of conflicts of interest, according to the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
.
3
Financial Advisers
Financial advisers registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
or a state regulator are bound by a code of ethics known as a
fiduciary duty
, a legal and ethical obligation requiring them to act in the best interest of their clients.
4
Code of Ethics vs. Code of Conduct
A code of ethics and a code of conduct both set professional standards to guide behavior of an organization’s members. However, there are some subtle differences:
A code of ethics ensures that members exercise sound judgment. For example, legal codes prevent lawyers from handling conflict-of-interest cases or brokers from trading against clients.
A code of conduct, meanwhile, specifies expected employee actions, including norms like punctuality and accuracy. Most companies implement an employee code of conduct to uphold professionalism and minimize workplace friction.
Having both a code of ethics and a code of conduct helps ensure that an organization operates with integrity and maintains professionalism with its employees.
How to Create a Code of Ethics
Organizations create codes of ethics to eliminate unacceptable or immoral behavior among their members, often focusing on existing ethical issues within their industry.
The first step is for an organization to identify its priorities and any ethical issues it wishes to avoid. For example, a company might want to prevent conflicts of interest due to past scandals. In that case, its code of ethics might prohibit inappropriate relationships or actions that could lead to a conflict of interest.
What Is an Example of a Code of Ethics?
Many firms and organizations have adopted a code of ethics. One good example comes from the CFA Institute (CFAI), the grantor of the chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation and creator of the CFA exams.
CFA charterholders
are among the most respected and globally recognized financial professionals. According to the CFAI’s website, members of the CFA Institute, including CFA charterholders, and candidates for the CFA designation must adhere to the following Code of Ethics:
5
Act with integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and ethics when dealing with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.
Place the integrity of the investment profession and clients’ interests above their interests.
Use reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.

Definition
A trustee manages and ultimately distributes assets in a trust to one or more beneficiaries.
What Is a Trustee?
A trustee is a person or firm that holds title to property or other assets in a trust and administers them according to the wishes of the trust creator.
A trustee may be appointed for various purposes, such as to manage a trust created by a grantor after the grantor dies (and for bankruptcy, certain types of retirement plans or pensions, or to manage assets for someone like a minor).
Trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to the trust's beneficiary or beneficiaries. This means a trustee must act in the best interests of the beneficiaries as they manage the trust's assets.
Key Takeaways
A trustee is usually designated by the original owner of a trust's assets, called the grantor. In some cases, a trustee may be assigned by a court.
A trustee may be appointed for various purposes, such as in the case of a trust, bankruptcy, for a charity, or for a trust fund.
Trustees may be individuals, independent business entities, or large financial institutions.
A trustee has a fiduciary responsibility to the trust beneficiaries and must make decisions in their best interests.
How a Trustee Works
A trustee is a person or organization that has been designated as trustee by the trust grantor (or
trustor
) and that holds the legal title to an asset or group of assets in the trust.
A trustee is granted this legal title through the trust document. The people or entities who benefit from the trust are called
beneficiaries

For example, a trust might be created to provide legal protection for the grantor's assets and ensure they are distributed according to the terms of the trust after the grantor's death. The trustee is charged with ensuring that the grantor's wishes are fulfilled.
1
A trustee is thus responsible for properly managing all property and other assets placed in the trust for the beneficiaries.
A trustee's specific duties are unique to the trust agreement and are dictated by the type of assets held in the trust.
For instance, if a trust holds various rental properties intended to be used for income, it will be the trustee's duty to ensure those those properties are managed, maintained, occupied, and generating income.
Trustees are also required to financially manage and oversee accounts within a trust when it is made up of other investments, such as
equities
in a
brokerage account
.
Important
Trustees have a
fiduciary duty
to the trust's beneficiaries, which means the trustee is required to put aside personal interest, beliefs, and biases to do what's best for them.
Responsibilities of a Trustee
All trustees have general guidelines to follow and responsibilities, regardless of the specifics in the trust agreement. Trustees generally assume the following duties:
Act as a fiduciary
: Ensure the trust is administered according to the grantor's wishes and in the best interest of the beneficiaries.
Ensure the safety of the assets
: Account for the funds and assets within the trust and understand who the beneficiaries are and what their rights are. Ensure trust assets are kept separate from other assets.
Administer the trust
: Keep records of all transactions and distribute assets as required.
File reports
:
Report
to state and federal regulators as
required
, and keep the beneficiaries updated.
Make decisions
: Make decisions about the assets as circumstances change, always in alignment with the grantor's wishes.
Invest
: Invest, allocate, or adjust assets as needed according to the wishes of the grantor.
Communicate with beneficiaries
: Initiate communication with the beneficiaries via emails, phone calls, or other methods of contact. Ensure beneficiaries clearly understand the grantor's wishes for the trust and be prepared to answer questions.
Types of Trustees
If you are selecting a trustee, you can choose someone you know. It might be best, however, to find someone with experience.
A trustee should understand the trust being set up and know what their responsibilities are.
For example, if the trust includes assets intended for your family's future generations, you'd want to appoint someone who understands how to manage wealth for capital appreciation as well as income.
There are generally three types of trustees:
Individual
: Friends or family members the grantor believes can administer the trust's assets properly.
Independent
: Businesses (not financial institutions) that specialize in trust management. You'll find investment advisors, accountants, and administrators at these private businesses. Many have names like XYZ Trust Company or ABC Wealth and Trust.
Institutional
: Many large financial institutions have trust professionals that administer, invest, and manage trusts for their clients.
Trustee vs. Executor
A trustee administers, manages, and distributes the assets in a trust after the grantor dies.
An executor administers and manages the estate of someone who has died, and distributes the assets left to heirs through a will.
An individual can name one person for each role or could appoint one to perform both roles.
2
Like a trustee, an executor can be a trust company, a bank, a trusted friend, or a family member.
Fast Fact
Trustees and executors must both follow the laws in their state when performing their duties.
Who to Choose As a Trustee
Choosing a trustee might be one of the most challenging tasks when creating a trust. It's tough to know which person or entity can best administer your assets according to your wishes. Here are some considerations for choosing a trustee:
Wealth Management/Trust Company
A wealth management and trust company has finance professionals, attorneys, and accountants and will administer a trust to the letter.
Your trust can be set up to pay any fees they may charge. You'll be able to rest knowing your assets are in the hands of someone who will act in the beneficiaries' best interests.
Friends or Family
You can choose a trusted friend or family member, but you'll need to ensure they are up to the task of administering your trust.
Additionally, they'll need an iron will to withstand the drama and resentment that could possibly arise when a family member is in charge of large sums of money and won't give any out on demand.
This person must be willing and able to continue the task as long as the trust exists. Lastly, you'll need to consider and appoint an alternate in case something happens to the primary trustee.
This ensures that your trust is administered by someone you choose rather than of the court's choosing.
Trust Attorney/Lawyer
A trust attorney can also be an excellent choice for trustee. They'll be familiar with trust laws in your state and be a reliable trustee.
However, if one of your intentions as the grantor is to grow wealth within the trust, a lawyer may not have the appropriate investment capabilities or understand how to manage wealth.
What Is the Role of a Trustee?
A trustee administers a trust based on the instructions of the grantor in the trust document. They must communicate with beneficiaries, allocate funds to investments, distribute payments according to instructions, and much more.
What Does It Mean If Someone Is a Trustee?
A trustee has been given the responsibility of ensuring that a grantor's assets are managed and distributed the way the grantor intended them to be. A trustee has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, rather than in their own interest.
What Are the 3 Duties of a Trustee?
A trustee must administer the trust per the grantor's instructions, be loyal to the beneficiaries, and deal with beneficiaries impartially.
The Bottom Line
A trustee is someone who has been granted a fiduciary responsibility to care for the assets placed in a trust on behalf of the trust's beneficiaries.
All states have laws governing trusts and how they must be administered. So it's essential for the person you designate as trustee to understand trusts and be up to the task.
If you don't know someone capable of being a trustee, you can find wealth management companies, banks, trust companies, and attorneys specializing in trust administration for the job.

Investopedia,"QTIP Trusts: Definition, How They Work, and Advantages","Close
Definition
A qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust allows a surviving spouse to receive income from the trust until their death, when the balance is paid to the original grantor’s beneficiaries.
What Is a Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) Trust?
A qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust is a legal document that protects an individual's assets on behalf of the surviving spouse while maintaining control over how the assets are distributed once the surviving spouse dies.
Income generated from the QTIP trust, and sometimes the principal, is paid to the surviving spouse to ensure lifelong support.
Key Takeaways
Under a QTIP trust, income is paid to a surviving spouse until that spouse's death. At that point, the balance of the funds is paid to the beneficiaries specified by the original grantor.
QTIP trusts are a useful tool in estate planning and are especially helpful when the trust grantor has surviving children from multiple marriages.
A QTIP trust also has tax advantages for the surviving spouse. Estate taxes are not assessed until after the death of the surviving spouse.
How Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) Trusts Work
The QTIP trust is a type of
irrevocable trust
that is most commonly used by individuals who have children from more than one marriage. The surviving spouse receives an income for life from the trust but the grantor directs how the remainder of the trust will be distributed after the surviving spouse's death.
1
Although it is most often used by individuals who have children from more than one marriage, the QTIP trust can be used to benefit any family member, friend, or cause.
The surviving spouse never assumes the power of appointment over the principal.
2
This prevents the assets from going to a new spouse should the beneficiary remarry.

Tax Advantages of a QTIP Trust
The QTIP trust has certain tax advantages for the surviving spouse.
The income paid to the surviving spouse from the QTIP trust qualifies for
marital deduction
.
1
That means that the assets in the trust are not taxable after the first spouse’s death. Instead, the property becomes taxable after the second spouse's death, with this
liability
transferring to the named beneficiaries.
Tip
QTIP trusts are reported on tax returns using IRD Form 706.
3
QTIP Trustee Appointments
A minimum of one
trustee
must be appointed to manage the trust, though there may be multiple trustees named. The trustee or trustees will be responsible for controlling the trust and have authority over the management of the assets.
Potential trustees include the surviving spouse, a financial institution, an attorney, or a family member or friend.
Spousal Payments and QTIP Trusts
The surviving spouse named within a QTIP trust typically receives payments from the
trust
based on the income the trust generates, similar to stock dividends. Payments may also be made from the principal if the grantor allows it when the trust is created.
Payments will be made to the spouse for life. Upon the person's death, the payments cease as they are not transferable. The
assets
in the trust become the property of the listed beneficiaries.
QTIP Trust vs. Marital Trust

Control does not pass to spouse

Trust originator controls asset distribution after spouse's death
Surviving spouse controls asset distribution
Either a QTIP trust or a marital trust can help you achieve similar estate planning goals. The key differences lie in how the assets in the trust are controlled.
A QTIP trust gives the grantor control over how the assets within the trust will be distributed after the death of the surviving spouse.
A
marital trust
allows the surviving spouse to dictate how the assets are distributed.
Unlike a QTIP trust, a marital trust does not require distributions to the surviving spouse. The surviving spouse controls the trust and makes the decisions.
Fast Fact
As the surviving spouse is never the true property owner, a lien cannot be put against the property within the trust or the trust itself.
Benefits of a QTIP
While QTIPs are similar to marital trusts, there are benefits in certain situations.
You control where the assets end up
: You control who your assets pass to after both you and your spouse die. This means that no matter what your spouse does after you pass on, any assets left in the trust are passed on to the secondary beneficiaries you name. These could be your children, grandchildren, or children from a previous marriage.
QTIPs protect all assets and income
: A surviving spouse may eventually be unable to make sound financial decisions. Dictating the trust's distribution in advance protects all of the beneficiaries from misuse of the assets.
How Does a QTIP Trust Work?
A QTIP trust is an irrevocable trust that pays income generated from the assets to a surviving spouse. When that spouse dies, the assets in the trust pass to the beneficiaries named by the grantor.
What Is the Difference Between a QTIP and Marital Trust?
The two are similar, except that a QTIP is not controlled by the surviving spouse. The surviving spouse receives income generated by the trust. Eventually, the assets will be distributed as the grantor specified.
What Are the Requirements of a QTIP Trust?
A QTIP is required to pay all of its income to the spouse beneficiary. There can be no other beneficiaries until that spouse passes away.
2
The Bottom Line
QTIP trusts are designed to ensure that your spouse is taken care of for life while the trust remains intact for other named beneficiaries.
QTIPs are not suitable for everyone or every situation. If you're not concerned with how your estate is distributed after your spouse dies, you don't need a QTIP. But if you want to determine how your assets are distributed after your spouse passes on, a QTIP will ensure your wishes are followed.

Investopedia,What Is a Disbursement?,"Close
Definition
A disbursement is a payment that's debited from a payer's account and then credited to the payee's account.
What Is a Disbursement?
A disbursement is a payment to an individual or entity from a private or public fund. It may also be a payment made on behalf of a client to a third party, money paid into a business's operating budget, the delivery of a loan amount to a borrower, or a
dividend to shareholders
.
Key Takeaways
A disbursement is the delivery of money from a fund.
A disbursement is recorded in the general ledger in business accounting.
A record of disbursements shows how a business spends its cash.
Payments of dividends to shareholders are often termed disbursements.
Student loan money paid into a school's account on behalf of a student is a disbursement.
Examples of Disbursements
Disbursements can take many forms.
Loans
A loan is disbursed when the agreed-upon amount is paid into the borrower's account and is available for use. The cash has been debited from the lender's account and credited to the borrower's account.
Tuition
A student loan disbursement is the payout of loan proceeds on behalf of a student. Schools and loan servicers notify students of the expected receipt of the disbursements in writing, including the amount of the loan and its effective date. A university or college may also directly give students grant money in payments that are referred to as disbursements.
Insurance claims
An insurance company will disburse money for repairs after an insurance adjuster has inspected damage to a home or property. The disbursement is based on the terms and limits of policies such as a homeowner's or automobile policy.

Business operations
Disbursement is part of
cash flow
and a record of day-to-day expenses. It can be an early warning of insolvency if disbursements are higher than revenues.
Retirement account withdrawals
It's recorded on the account as a balance drawdown when money is disbursed from a retirement account.
Controlled disbursements
Controlled disbursements are a cash flow management service for a bank's corporate clients.
Controlled disbursement
allows customers to review and reschedule disbursements on a day-to-day basis. Clients maximize the interest they earn on the cash in their accounts by delaying when money is debited from the account.
Third-party payments
A lawyer will commonly complete and record disbursements when paying for services on behalf of a client. These disbursements may include payments to various
third parties
for costs such as court fees, private investigator services, courier services, and expert reports.
Important
Remote or
delayed disbursement
deliberately stalls the payment process by paying with a check drawn from a bank located in a remote region. Banks could process a payment only when the original paper check was received so this delayed the debit to the payer's account for several business days. Electronic transfers have made delayed disbursements less common.
Accounting for Disbursements
A company makes disbursements during a set period in bookkeeping such as a quarter or a year. A bookkeeper records each transaction and posts it to one or more ledgers such as a
cash disbursement journal
and the
general ledger
. Disbursements are recorded with the date, the payee name, the amount debited or credited, the payment method, and the purpose of the payment.
The overall cash balance of the business is adjusted to account for the transaction. Disbursement journals and ledgers are records of the money flowing out and may differ from actual profit or loss. A company that uses the
accrual method of accounting
reports expenses when they occur, not necessarily when they're paid, and it reports income when it's earned, not when it is received.
The type of items listed in the ledger depends on the business. A retailer has payments for inventory,
accounts payable
, and salaries. A manufacturer has transactions for raw materials and production costs.
Disbursement vs. Drawdown
A disbursement is a payment. A
drawdown
is the consequence of a particular type of disbursement. A retiree receives a disbursement when money is withdrawn from a retirement account. That disbursement represents a drawdown on the balance in their account.
A retiree receives a $10,000 disbursement when they withdraw 10% of a $100,000 balance in a traditional IRA account. This represents a drawdown of $10,000 or 10% from the account which results in a balance of $90,000.
Can a Loan Disbursement Be Negative?
A loan disbursement can be positive or negative. A positive disbursement results in a credit to an account while a negative disbursement results in an account debit. A negative disbursement may occur if financial aid funds are overpaid and later withdrawn from the student's account.
What's the Difference Between a Disbursement and a Payment?
A disbursement is a payment from a fund. Disbursement implies that a payment has been finalized and properly recorded as a debit on the payer's side and a credit on the payee's side.
What Is a Disbursement Fee?
A disbursement fee is usually a charge to cover payments made by the vendor on behalf of a customer. FedEx may pay duty and tax charges for a shipment on behalf of a customer and then add a disbursement fee to its bill to the customer to cover the payments.
The Bottom Line
A disbursement is a payment made from a fund or a payment debited from the payer's account and credited to the payee's account. Recording all disbursements is a crucial method of keeping tabs on expenditures for a business.

Investopedia,X-Efficiency: Meaning and History in Economics,"Close
Definition
X-efficiency measures how effectively a firm uses its inputs to maximize outputs under conditions of imperfect competition.
What Is X-Efficiency?
X-efficiency refers to the degree of efficiency maintained by firms under conditions of imperfect competition. Efficiency in this context means a company getting the maximum outputs from its inputs, including employee productivity and manufacturing efficiency.
In a highly competitive market, firms are forced to be as efficient as possible to ensure strong profits and continued existence. This is not true in situations of imperfect competition, such as with a
monopoly
or
duopoly
.
Key Takeaways
X-efficiency is the degree of efficiency maintained by firms under conditions of imperfect competition such as the case of a monopoly.
Economist Harvey Leibenstein challenged the belief that firms were always rational and called this anomaly ""X"" for unknown–or x-efficiency.
Leibenstein introduced the human element, arguing that there could be degrees of efficiency, meaning that–at times–firms didn't always maximize profits
1
﻿
Understanding X-Efficiency
X-efficiency points to irrational actions in the market by firms. Traditional neoclassical economics made the assumption that companies operated in rational ways, meaning they maximized production at the lowest possible costs–even when the markets were not efficient. Harvey Leibenstein, a Harvard professor and economist, challenged the belief that firms were always rational and called this anomaly ""X"" for unknown–or x-efficiency. In the absence of real competition, companies are more tolerant of inefficiencies in their operations. The concept of x-efficiency is used to estimate how much more efficient a company would be in a more competitive environment.
1
﻿﻿
Born in the Ukraine, Harvey Leibenstein (1922-1994) was a professor at Harvard University whose primary contribution—other than x-efficiency and its various applications to economic development, property rights, entrepreneurs, and bureaucracy—was the critical minimum effort theory that aimed to find a solution to breaking the poverty cycle in underdeveloped countries.
When calculating x-efficiency, a data point is usually selected to represent an industry and then it is modeled using
regression-analysis
. For example, a bank might be judged by total costs divided by total assets to get a single data point for a firm. Then, the data points for all the banks would be compared using regression analysis to identify the most x-efficient and where the majority fall. This analysis can be done for a specific country to find out how x-efficient certain sectors are or across borders for a particular sector to see the regional and jurisdictional variations.
History of X-Efficiency
Leibenstein proposed the concept of x-efficiency in a 1966 paper titled ""Allocative Efficiency vs. 'X-Efficiency,'"" which appeared in The American Economic Review.
Allocative efficiency
is when a company's marginal costs are equal to price and can occur when the competition is very high in that industry. Prior to 1966, economists believed that firms were efficient with the exception of circumstances of allocative efficiency. Leibenstein introduced the human element whereby factors could exist, attributable to management or workers, that don't maximize production or achieve the lowest possible costs in production.
In the summary section of the paper, Leibenstein asserted that ""microeconomic theory focuses on allocative efficiency to the exclusion of other types of efficiencies that are much more significant in many instances. Furthermore, improvement in 'non-allocative efficiency' is an important aspect of the process of growth."" Leibenstein concluded that the
theory of the firm
does not depend on cost-minimization; rather, unit costs are influenced by x-efficiency, which in turn, ""depends on the degree of competitive pressure, as well as other motivational factors.""
In the extreme market structure case–monopoly—Leibenstein observed less worker effort. In other words, with no competition, there is less worker and management desire to maximize production and compete. On the other hand, when competitive pressures were high, workers exerted more effort. Leibenstein argued that there is much more to gain for a firm and its profit-making ways by increasing x-efficiency instead of allocative efficiency.
The theory of x-efficiency was controversial when it was introduced because it conflicted with the assumption of utility-maximizing behavior, a well-accepted axiom in economic theory.
Utility
is essentially the benefit or satisfaction from a behavior, such as consuming a product.
Important
X-efficiency helps to explain why companies might have little motivation to maximize profits in a market where the company is already profitable and faces little threat from competitors.
Before Leibenstein, companies were believed to always maximize profits in a rational manner, unless there was extreme competition. X-efficiency posited that there could be varying levels of degrees of efficiency that companies might operate. Firms with little motivation or no competition could lead to X-inefficiency—meaning they choose not to maximize profits because there's little motivation to achieve maximum utility. However, some economists argue that the concept of x-efficiency is merely the observance of workers' utility-maximizing tradeoff between effort and leisure. Empirical evidence for the theory of x-efficiency is mixed.
X-Efficiency vs. X-Inefficiency
X-efficiency and x-inefficiency are the same economic concept. X-efficiency measures how close to optimal efficiency a firm is operating in a given market. For example, a firm may be 0.85 x-efficient, meaning it is operating at 85% of its optimal efficiency. This would be considered very high in a market with significant government controls and state-owned enterprises. X-inefficiency is the same measurement, but the focus is on the gap between current efficiency and potential. A state-owned enterprise in the same market as the previous company may have an x-efficiency ratio of 0.35, meaning it is operating at only 35% of its optimal efficiency. In this case, the firm may be referred to as x-inefficient to draw attention to the large gap, even though it is still x-efficiency that is being measured.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are metrics that help management compare a company’s overall long-term performance against a set of targets, objectives, or industry peers.
What Are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined measurements used to assess a company’s long-term performance. Organizations use KPIs to track their progress on key business objectives.
KPIs help a company achieve its strategic, financial, and operational goals, particularly when compared to those of other businesses within the same sector. They can also be used to judge progress or achievements against a set of benchmarks or past performance.
Key Takeaways
Key performance indicators (KPIs) measure a company’s success vs. a set of targets, objectives, or industry peers.
KPIs can be financial, including net profit (or the bottom line, net income), revenues minus certain expenses, or the current ratio (liquidity and cash availability).
Customer-focused KPIs generally center on per-customer efficiency, customer satisfaction, and customer retention.
Process-focused KPIs aim to measure and monitor operational performance across the organization.
Businesses generally measure and track KPIs through analytics software and reporting tools.
Jiaqi Zhou / Investopedia
Why Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Matter
Key performance indicators are used in business to judge performance and progress toward specific, measurable goals. As such, they provide owners and managers with an overview of how their business, or an aspect of their business, is performing at a certain point in time. They may be compared to:
A predetermined benchmark
Other competitors within the industry
The performance of the business over time
Also referred to as key success indicators (KSIs), KPIs vary between companies and between industries, depending on performance criteria. For example, a software company striving to attain the fastest growth in its industry may consider
year-over-year (YOY)
revenue growth as its chief performance indicator. Conversely, a retail chain might place more value on same-store sales as the best KPI metric for gauging growth.

At the heart of KPIs lie data collection, storage, cleaning, and synthesizing. The KPI data is gathered and compared to the target that has been set. The results of that comparison are analyzed and used to draw conclusions about how well current systems or recent changes to those systems are working to achieve the department's or business's goals. This allows management to determine whether the current systems are effective and whether adjustments are needed to improve those outcomes and meet future goals.
The goal of KPIs is to communicate results succinctly to allow management to make more informed strategic decisions. They are often measured using analytics software and reporting tools.
Fast Fact
The information from key performance indicators may be financial, nonfinancial, relate to any department across a company, or assess the performance of the business as a whole.
Companies can use KPIs across three broad levels.
Company-Wide
Company-wide KPIs focus on the overall business health and performance. These types of KPIs are useful for informing management of how operations stand in the company as a whole. However, they are often not granular enough to make decisions. Company-wide KPIs often spark discussions about the performance of various departments.
Department-Wide
Department-level KPIs are more specific than company-wide KPIs and often provide information on why specific outcomes are occurring. Companies often dig into department-level KPIs to better understand the results of their KPIs. For example, if overall revenue is down, a company may want to look at customer conversion or satisfaction rates in specific departments.
Project or Sub-Department
If a company chooses to dig even deeper, it may engage with project-level or subdepartment-level KPIs. These KPIs must often be requested by management, as they may require very specific data sets that are not readily available. For example, management may want to ask a control group about a potential product
rollout
.
How to Set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
It's important for an organization to create key performance indicators that are aligned with its business goals and outcomes. That means the KPIs will be specific to the business and not simply a set of general rules. Here are some of the considerations to keep in mind when setting KPIs.
Set clear objectives
: KPIs need to be connected to a core business goal that's tied to the organization's success, whether it's financial, customer-service driven, marketing, or another type of goal. Be sure to define what success means and decide on how it will be measured. Without following these steps, an organization could waste time and valuable resources to produce results that don't help it reach its target goals.
Communicate the KPIs
: Employees need to understand and be onboard with the organization's KPIs, so a critical step is sharing them, explaining why the goals are important, and how they will be achieved. A company's employees may raise valuable questions and concerns that need to be addressed for the KPIs to be meaningful.
Review your KPIs
: Regularly reviewing KPIs should help ensure they are relevant and up-to-date. The business environment changes continuously, which means you may need to adjust your KPIs based on your organization's performance as it evolves and as its needs change.
KPIs vs. Metrics
Key performance indicators are quantitative measures of business goals that rely on metrics. Metrics track activities and processes that are specific to an area of a business or one of its departments.
Common Types of of Key Performance Indicators
Most KPIs fall into four broad categories. Each category has its own characteristics, time frame, and level of business that is likely to use it. Different KPIs may also be used by different departments within the same company.
Strategic
Strategic KPIs are usually the highest-level. These types of KPIs may indicate how a company is doing, although they don't provide much information beyond a high-level snapshot.
Executives are most likely to use strategic KPIs. Examples include
return on investment
,
profit margin
, and total company
revenue
.
Operational
Operational KPIs are focused on a tight time frame. These KPIs measure a company's performance month over month, or sometimes day over day, by analyzing various processes, segments, or geographical locations.
Operational KPIs are often used by management staff to answer questions derived from analyzing strategic KPIs. For example, if an executive notices that company-wide revenue has decreased, they may investigate which product lines are struggling.
Functional
Functional KPIs hone in on specific departments or functions within a company. For example, a finance department may keep track of how many new vendors they register within their accounting information system each month. A marketing department measures how many clicks each email distribution receives.
These types of KPIs may be strategic or operational. What sets them apart is that they provide the greatest value to one specific set of users.
Leading and Lagging
Leading and lagging KPIs describe the nature of the data being analyzed and whether it is signaling something to come or something that has already occurred. Leading KPIs indicate a change that is coming in the future. Lagging KPIs indicate a change that has already happened.
Examples of these are the number of overtime hours worked and the profit margin for a flagship product. The number of overtime hours worked may be a leading KPI should the company begin to notice poorer
manufacturing
quality. Alternatively, profit margins are a result of operations and are considered a lagging indicator.
Frequently Used KPIs
Financial Metrics
Key performance indicators tied to the financials typically focus on revenue and profit margins. Net profit, the most tried and true of profit-based measurements, represents the amount of revenue that remains, as profit for a given period, after accounting for all of the company's expenses, taxes, and interest payments for the same period.

Free Carrier (FCA) is a trade term that requires a seller to deliver goods to a carrier at a specified location and to bear all risk of loss until delivery, upon which the buyer assumes the risk.
What Is Free Carrier (FCA)?
Free carrier is when a
seller
is responsible for delivering to a destination specified by the buyer. The destination is typically an airport, shipping terminal, warehouse, or other location where the
carrier
operates.
The seller includes transportation costs in its price and assumes the risk of loss until the carrier receives the goods. At this point, the buyer assumes all responsibility.
Key Takeaways
Free carrier is when a seller of goods must deliver those goods to an airport, shipping terminal, warehouse, or other carrier location specified by the buyer.
The seller includes transportation costs in its price and assumes the risk of loss until the carrier receives the goods.
Once the seller delivers the goods to the carrier, the buyer assumes all responsibility for the goods.
As part of the liability transfer, the seller is responsible for delivery to the specified carrier location, but isn't obligated to unload the goods.
Investopedia / Crea Taylor
How Free Carrier (FCA) Works
Buyers and sellers engaged in
economic trade
can use FCA shipping terms to describe any transportation point, regardless of the number of transportation modes involved in the shipping process. The point must be a location within the seller’s home country, however. It's the seller's duty to safely transport the goods to that facility. The carrier can be any kind of transportation service, such as a truck, train, boat, or airplane.
Liability
for the merchandise transfers from the seller to the carrier or buyer at the time the seller delivers the goods to the agreed location. The seller is only responsible for delivery to the specified destination as part of the liability transfer. It isn't obligated to unload the goods, but the seller might be responsible for ensuring that the goods have been cleared for
export out of the United States
if the destination is the seller's premises.
Under FCA shipping terms, the buyer doesn't have to deal with export details and licenses because this is the responsibility of the seller. The buyer must arrange for transport, however. Once goods arrive at the carrier and
title
transfers to the buyer, the goods become an
asset
on the buyer's
balance sheet
.
Important
Many experts recommend that any party involved in international trade consult with an appropriate legal professional—such as a trade attorney—before using any trade term within a contract.
FCA Incoterms
Contracts involving international transportation often contain abbreviated trade terms, or terms of sale, that describe shipment specifics. These might include the time and place of delivery, payment, the point at which the
risk of loss
shifts from the seller to the buyer, and the party responsible for freight and insurance costs.
To help facilitate the delivery of such items, the most commonly known trade terms are international commercial terms (
Incoterms
). Incoterms are internationally recognized standards published by the
International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC). These are often identical in form to domestic terms, such as the
Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC), but there can be slight differences in their official interpretations.
The term free carrier (FCA) is a typical example of Incoterms. It has been internationally recognized as a standard set of instructions to designate delivery terms. FCA shipping terms were included in Incoterms starting in 1980 and have been revised every ten years.
1
Fast Fact
Established by the International Chamber of Commerce, the Incoterms rules may be purchased via the ICC's website.
Example of FCA
Under FCA shipping terms, the seller delivers the goods to the destination named by the buyer. The shipper has responsibility for the goods until they arrive there. The buyer is responsible for loading the goods for transport.
For example, say Susan, a seller, ships goods to Bob, a buyer, under an FCA shipping term agreement. Bob opts to use a shipper he's done business with before. Susan agrees. It's her responsibility to deliver the goods to the shipper. At this point, all liability passes to Bob.
What Is the Difference Between FCA and FOB?
FCA and FOB are shipment terms used in different types of transportation. FOB delivery applies only to sea shipments and occurs when cargo is loaded onto a vessel. Loading the goods onto the vessel is the seller's responsibility. Under FCA, many more types of transport are allowable, and loading onto the carrier is the buyer's responsibility. The supplier is usually obligated to issue an export declaration once goods have been placed onto a buyer's vehicle.
What Is the Difference Between FCA and DDP?
Under DDP shipping terms, the seller has to pay for the transportation costs. In addition, the seller holds all risks and responsibilities for the transportation of the goods until the buyer receives them. FCA shipping terms are usually paid for by the buyer since the carrier is nominated by the buyer.
Who Pays for FCA Shipping?
Under FCA shipping terms, the buyer often pays for the transportation, since they are the party responsible for
nominating the carrier to use
.
Who Is Responsible for Export Clearance Under FCA?
Under FCA shipping terms, the seller is responsible for export duty, taxes, and custom clearance. The buyer is responsible for importing items.
The Bottom Line
Under FCA shipping terms, the seller is responsible for pre-carriage to a terminal, delivery to the agreed upon destination, and proof of delivery. The seller is also responsible for export packaging, licenses, and customs formalities. The buyer pays for the goods and is responsible for the main means of transportation. The buyer also covers loading charges, import duties, taxes, and formalities.

The Producer Price Index quantifies deflation and inflation and is a strong indicator of the health of the economy.
What Is the Producer Price Index (PPI)?
The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a measure of inflation at the wholesale level. It's compiled from thousands of indexes that measure producer prices by industry and product category. The index is published monthly by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
.
The PPI is different from the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the changes in the price of goods and services paid by consumers.
Key Takeaways
The Producer Price Index is a measure of wholesale inflation, while the Consumer Price Index measures the prices paid by consumers.
The index is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
PPI indexes are calculated based on products and services, industries, and the buyer's economic identity, which are used to calculate the overall monthly change in final demand PPI.
The indexes calculate price changes in private contracts based on suppliers' input prices.
Investopedia / Daniel Fishel
How the Producer Price Index (PPI) Works
The PPI measures
inflation
(or, much less commonly,
deflation
) from the perspective of the product manufacturer or service supplier. The price trends for producers and consumers are unlikely to diverge for long since producer prices heavily influence those charged to consumers and vice versa. In the short term, inflation at the wholesale and retail levels may differ as a result of distribution costs, as well as government taxes and subsidies.
1
The BLS releases the PPI along with its constituent industry and product indexes during the second week of the month following the reference date of the survey. It is based on approximately 100,000 monthly price quotes reported voluntarily online by more than 25,000 systematically sampled producer establishments.
2
3
+3.3%
The PPI reading for the 12 months ending December 2024 on an unadjusted basis. The index for final demand increased by 0.2% in December from November.
4
The survey covers the entirety of the U.S. output of goods and about 69% by value of services. Its component product and services indexes are weighted based on the value of the category's output to calculate the overall change in producer prices.

The PPI is used to forecast inflation and to calculate
escalator clauses
in private contracts based on the prices of key inputs. It is also vital for tracking price changes by industry and comparing wholesale and retail price trends.
5
Producer Price Index (PPI) vs. Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Both PPI and CPI are important economic measures because they point to monthly changes in prices. But they reflect prices from different standpoints. As noted above, the PPI measures prices based on the first commercial transaction for a product or service.
5
This is in contrast to the
consumer price index
, which measures price changes encountered by the consumer.
6
The CPI's focus is on the final sale. But these two indexes don't just differ based on the type of
prices
measured. There are also important compositional differences between the PPI and the CPI that can be considered. These distinctions are based on what's included and left out of each.
Important
Until 1978, the PPI was known as the
wholesale price index (WPI)
. In 1982, the BLS reset all Producer Price Index bases to 100.
7
For example, the PPI does not measure price changes for aggregate housing costs, while the CPI's shelter category including the imputed owners' equivalent of rents accounts for one-third of the overall index.
Another key distinction is that the PPI does not include the price of imported goods, unlike the CPI. Conversely, the PPI includes export prices while the CPI does not.
8
How Producer Price Index (PPI) Numbers Are Presented
The BLS produces more than 10,000 product and industry price indexes each month, which it then uses to calculate the PPI. They're published with and without
seasonal adjustments
and are divided into three categories: industry-level classification, commodity classification, and first demand-intermediate demand.
9
Industry-level classification
The PPI includes indexes for producer prices received in each of more than 500 industry categories based on output sold outside the industry. The categories are compatible with those used in other releases to report industry-level data on production, employment, earnings, and
productivity
.
9
Commodity classification
Commodity classification disregards the producer's industry to group output based on the nature of the product or service. The PPI report publishes more than 3,800 commodity price indexes for goods and some 900 for services.
9
Final demand-intermediate demand
The first demand-intermediate demand indexes use the
commodity indexes
organized by product to measure producer prices based on the economic identity of the buyers and whether the goods sold require further processing.
The PPI report publishes more than 600 FD-ID indexes. The final demand indexes, as distinct from the intermediate demand ones, are then used to arrive at the headline PPI number, which reflects the PPI for final demand.
9
What Is in the Producer Price Index?
The Producer Price Index ""measures the average change over time in the selling prices that domestic producers receive for their output. The prices included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products and some services.""
5
What's the Difference Between the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index?
Both the CPI and the PPI measure inflation. PPI measures inflation from the viewpoint of the producers; the average selling price they receive for their output over time. The CPI measures inflation from the viewpoint of the consumer through the value of a basket of goods and services that consumers have bought over a certain period.
8
What Does the Producer Price Index Predict?
The Producer Price Index looks at inflation from the viewpoint of industry and business. This method measures price changes before consumers purchase final goods and services. As a result, many analysts consider it to predict inflation before the CPI.
The Bottom Line
The Producer Price Index is a measure of the change in prices that domestic producers receive for their goods and services. The index is a measure of wholesale inflation and an indicator of the health of the economy.

Customer service is the support and assistance that a company provides to its customers before and after purchasing its products or services.
What Is Customer Service?
Customer service is the support, assistance, and advice provided by a company to its customers both before and after they buy or use
its products or services. Customer service is a critical factor in ensuring buyer satisfaction. It also helps a company retain customers and grow its business.
Key Takeaways
Customer service is the interaction between the buyer of a product and the company that sells it.
Good customer service is critical to business success, ensuring brand loyalty one customer at a time.
Recent innovations have focused on automating customer service systems, but the human element is, in some cases, indispensable.
Investopedia / Jessica Olah
How Customer Service Works
At most companies,
customer service representatives
are the only employees who have direct contact with buyers or users. The buyers' perceptions of the company and the product are shaped in part by their experience in dealing with that person. This is why many companies work hard to increase customer satisfaction levels.
Successful small businesses
and large companies alike understand the need for excellent customer service instinctively. Here are the key components of excellent customer service:
Timely attention to issues raised by customers is critical. Requiring a customer to wait in line or sit on hold sours an interaction before it begins and can
ruin their opinion of a business
.
Customer service should be a single-step process for the consumer. If a customer calls a helpline, the representative should, whenever possible, follow the problem through to its resolution.
If a customer must be transferred to another department, the original representative should follow up with the customer to ensure that the problem was solved.
Fast Fact
Customer service should be a one-stop process for the consumer whenever possible.
Benefits of Customer Service
There are many reasons why it's a good idea to invest in excellent customer service. The following are just some of the main benefits of implementing a customer service program within a company:
Customer Retention:
The first and most obvious advantage of having a customer service plan in place is to keep customers happy. It means listening to concerns, being empathetic, and streamlining issues related to product availability, payment, returns, and technical support. Showing that a company cares keeps its customers loyal.
Employee Retention:
Customer service isn't just for customers. It also helps keep employees with the company. When customers are happy, employees are, too. People tend to want to work for a business that cares about its customers.
Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving:
Businesses have to take care of their customers' problems. But companies that take a proactive approach tend to do better. This means that it's important to reach out to customers before any issues arise. This shows that the company cares and is doing all that it can to ensure a smooth customer experience.
Referrals:
Consumers who have a good experience might pass on that information to others through word-of-mouth, customer reviews, or
social media
. This often helps businesses generate new sales.
Brand Boost:
Businesses that show consumers they care through customer service help increase their
brand equity
. This leads to more referrals and an increase in sales.
Increased Customer Lifetime Value:
This refers to the relationship customer service helps establish and solidify with a single customer. When a company provides someone with good service, that person is more likely to add to the company's revenue by remaining loyal and making more purchases.
Corporate Culture:
Customer service allows businesses to streamline their
workflows
and promote cooperation among different teams. This includes communication between agents and managers, technical engineers, and production teams. All of this helps corporations achieve their goals of customer attraction and retention, which increases sales revenue.
Competitive Advantage:
Having a good customer service base sets a company apart from its competition. It boosts its reputation and increases its brand value by showing consumers and competitors that the business values the relationships it has with new and existing customers.
Traits of Good Customer Service
It isn't enough to have a customer service plan in place. The plan needs to be effectively executed to reap the benefits. But before we look at what effective execution looks like, it's important to understand bad customer service.
Bad customer service is any communication or experience where a consumer feels as though they are let down. This includes negative experiences, such as long wait or hold times, not being able to speak to an agent, being transferred too many times, and not being heard. This can lead customers to provide negative reviews and/or begin shopping with a competitor.
There are a few key traits that businesses can apply to their customer service to make it a better experience.
Personalization:
Tailoring the experience to each customer is an effective way of practicing good customer service. After all, not everyone has the same needs. Listening to what a customer's needs are can help determine the course of action and the direction of the experience.
Speed:
Businesses should provide their service quickly. If there's a problem, it should be resolved as soon as possible. Customers don't want to wait to get an issue resolved or to have their questions answered. Having said this, there is a fine balance between speed and problem-solving. Don't brush off the customer or get them off the phone without a resolution. This means that
efficiency
and effectiveness may have to supersede speed in order to provide a great experience.
Option for Self-Service:
It's important to give customers the option to help themselves, whether that's through an automated banking telephone service or a self-service checkout. Keep in mind that this should be done only if consumers want it. Forcing everyone to help themselves may alienate those who want to deal with customer service agents.
Listening and Empathy:
This requires training and skills, along with a certain degree of compassion.
Being Proactive:
It's a good idea to reach out to customers first rather than waiting for a problem to arise. It shows that a company cares. This can be done with a simple follow-up email or a phone call.
Important
The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that job growth for customer service representatives will decline by 5% between 2023 and 2033.

How to Deliver Great Customer Service
Studies of customer service have centered on creating the perfect
online experience
. The first and most difficult factor is the multiplicity of channels. Today's customers expect to get service through whatever app or device they happen to be using at the moment.
Once again, the focus has been on packaging how-to content and related resources that are designed for self-service. Increasingly
sophisticated data analytics
also are being used to identify dissatisfied or low-engagement customers. But, as always, the most effective customer service needs to incorporate human contact, if only as a last resort.
Customer Service Channels
There are a number of different channels to deliver customer service. Many companies, especially larger ones, offer more than one way for consumers to reach them. Smaller businesses may use one or just a few of them. And in the age of social media, it's become even easier to get in touch with businesses.
The following chart highlights some of the most common customer service channels companies use.
Telephone
Historically, this is the most common way for customers to reach a company.
In Person
Brick-and-mortar stores can offer customer service in person. Although some consumers don't want the hassle of going into a store, there are some who prefer a more personal, face-to-face experience.
Self-Service
This allows consumers to take matters into their own hands by directing the course of the experience based on their own wants and needs.
Email
Email eliminates the need to wait for an agent and allows the customer to explain their situation.
Social Media
Opening up the possibility of communication through different social media channels allows consumers to communicate through the platform(s) of their choice. It al",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp

What Is Just-in-Time (JIT)?
The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that aligns raw-material orders from suppliers directly with production schedules. Companies employ this inventory strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they need them for the production process, which reduces inventory costs. This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.
Key Takeaways
Just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing is also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS) because the car manufacturer adopted the system in the 1970s.
1
Kanban is a scheduling system often used in conjunction with JIT to avoid overcapacity of work-in-process.
The success of the JIT production process relies on steady production, high-quality workmanship, no machine breakdowns, and reliable suppliers.
The terms short-cycle manufacturing, used by Motorola, and continuous-flow manufacturing, used by IBM, are synonymous with the JIT system.

How Does Just-in-Time Inventory (JIT) Work?
The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system
minimizes inventory and increases efficiency
. JIT production systems cut inventory costs because manufacturers receive materials and parts as needed for production and do not have to pay storage costs. Manufacturers are also not left with unwanted inventory if an order is canceled or not fulfilled.
One example of a JIT inventory system is a car manufacturer that operates with low inventory levels but heavily relies on its supply chain to deliver the parts it requires to build cars on an as-needed basis. Consequently, the manufacturer orders the parts required to assemble the vehicles only after an order is received.
For JIT manufacturing to succeed, companies must have steady production, high-quality workmanship, glitch-free plant machinery, and reliable suppliers.
Fast Fact
The just-in-time inventory system is different from the
just-in-case
system, where producers hold sufficient inventories to have enough products to absorb maximum market demand.
Advantages and Disadvantages of JIT
JIT inventory systems have several advantages over traditional models. Production runs are short, which means that manufacturers can quickly move from one product to another. Also, this method reduces costs by minimizing warehouse needs. Companies also spend less money on
raw materials
because they buy just enough resources to make the ordered products and no more.

The disadvantages of JIT inventory systems involve potential disruptions in the supply chain. If a raw-materials supplier has a breakdown and cannot deliver the goods promptly, this could conceivably stall the entire production line. A sudden unexpected order for goods may delay the delivery of finished products to end clients.
Example of JIT
Famous for its JIT inventory system, Toyota Motor Corporation orders parts only when it receives new car orders. Although the company installed this method in the 1970s, it took 20 years to perfect it.
4
Toyota's JIT inventory system nearly caused the company to come to a halt in February 1997, after a fire at Japanese-owned automotive parts supplier Aisin decimated its capacity to produce P-valves for Toyota's vehicles. Because Aisin is the sole supplier of this part, its weeks-long shutdown caused Toyota to halt production for several days.
5
This caused a ripple effect, where other Toyota parts suppliers likewise had to temporarily shut down because the automaker had no need for their parts during that time period. Consequently, this fire cost Toyota 160 billion yen in revenue.
6
7
Important
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effect on the economy and supply chain, things like paper surgical masks, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer experienced disruption. This was because inputs from overseas factories and warehouses could not be delivered in time to meet the surge in demand caused by the pandemic.
8
Special Considerations
Kanban
is a Japanese scheduling system that's often used in conjunction with
lean manufacturing
and JIT. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiency.
9
The kanban system highlights problem areas by measuring lead and cycle times across the production process, which helps identify upper limits for work-in-process inventory to avoid overcapacity.
What Exactly Do You Mean by Just-in-Time?
A just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that has a company receive goods as close as possible to when they are actually needed. So, if a car assembly plant needs to install airbags, it does not keep a stock of airbags on its shelves but receives them as those cars come onto the assembly line.
Is Just-in-Time Manufacturing Risky?
A chief benefit of a JIT system is that it minimizes the need for a company to store large quantities of inventory, which improves efficiency and provides substantial cost savings. However, if there is a supply or demand shock, it can bring everything to a halt.
For instance, at the beginning of the 2020's economic crisis, everything from ventilators to surgical masks experienced disruption as inputs from overseas could not reach their destinations in time to meet a surge in demand.
What Types of Companies Use JIT?
Retailers, restaurants, on-demand publishing, tech manufacturing, and automobile manufacturing are examples of industries that have benefited from the just-in-time inventory system.
Who Invented JIT Inventory Management?
JIT is attributed to the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Executives at Toyota in the 1970s reasoned that the company could adapt more quickly and efficiently to changes in trends or demands for model changes if it did not keep any more inventory than was immediately needed.
10
The Bottom Line
The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that minimizes inventory and increases efficiency. It's popular with
small businesses and major corporations alike
because it enhances cash flow and reduces the capital needed to run the business. However, if there's a disruption in the supply chain, the system might fail to get things done on time.

Investopedia,Spreads in Finance: The Multiple Meanings in Trading Explained,"Close
Definition
A bid price is the most a buyer is willing to pay, an ask price is the least a seller is willing to accept, and the spread is the difference between them.
Few terms in finance are as potentially confusing as ""spread."" The word carries many meanings and each is critical to understanding market dynamics and investing strategies. Spreads are important to know for nearly every aspect of financial markets from the difference between bid and ask prices to more complex options strategies.
A spread in finance typically refers to some form of difference or gap between two related values. In stock trading, the spread generally refers to the gap between buying and selling prices. In bonds, it indicates the yield differential between two securities. Options traders use spreads to create sophisticated risk management strategies, while forex traders focus on currency pair differences.
Understanding these various types of spreads is crucial for anyone looking to navigate financial markets effectively. They impact the cost of trading and provide a greater understanding of market liquidity, risk, and potential profit opportunities. Below, we remove any confusion among these meanings while detaining their importance for investors.
Key Takeaways
The term ""spread"" in finance generally refers to a difference between two related values, but its specific meaning varies across markets and trading contexts.
In stock trading, the bid-ask spread is the gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, serving as an indicator of liquidity.
Bond spreads typically measure the yield difference between two securities, often used to assess relative risk or value between fixed-income investments.
In options trading, spreads refer to strategies involving multiple options contracts and are designed to manage risk or speculate on price movements with a more limited downside.
Understanding Spreads
Spreads are the lifeblood of financial markets. They tell us about liquidity, risk appetite, and market efficiency all at once. Let's describe the major types in turn in the order we discuss them below:
Securities
: The most common spread is the bid-ask spread. This is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask). A narrow spread for stocks often indicates high liquidity and low transaction costs, while a wider spread suggests the opposite. Spreads can also refer to the gap between a short position (selling) in one futures contract or currency and a long position (buying) in another. This is officially known as a spread trade.
Bond market spreads
: Bond yields spreads to measure the yield difference between two securities. The most well-known is the
yield spread
, which compares the interest rates of two bonds with different credit qualities or maturities. For instance, the spread between U.S. Treasury bonds and corporate bonds of the same maturity reveals the added yield investors demand for taking on the higher risk of corporate debt.
Lending
: Spread refers to a borrower's price above a benchmark yield to get a loan. For example, if the prime interest rate is 3%, and a borrower receives a mortgage charging a 5% rate, the spread is 2%. From the institution's point of view, it's the difference between the interest rate it charges on loans and the interest rate it pays on deposits. This spread is a primary source of profit for banks and other lending institutions.
1
Options trading
: Spreads have a different meaning in options altogether. Here, spreads refer to strategies involving multiple options contracts. These strategies, such as
bull spreads
or butterfly spreads, allow traders to fine-tune their risk exposure.
Foreign exchange (forex) markets
: Here, spreads represent the difference between currency pairs' buy and sell prices. These spreads can fluctuate based on market volatility and liquidity.
1. Stock Market Spreads
Bid-Ask Spreads
Most
securities
sell in a two-sided market, such as most stocks, where there is a
bid-ask spread
that marks the difference between the highest bid price and the lowest offer. The bid-ask spread is often used to help assess a stock's liquidity.
For instance, in the stock market, a highly liquid stock like Apple Inc. (
AAPL
) may have a hypothetical bid price of $150.00 and an ask price of $150.02, resulting in a spread of just $0.02. This tight spread suggests a highly liquid market with many buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, a thinly traded stock, like a small-cap company, might have a bid price of $10.00 and an ask price of $10.50, resulting in a much larger spread of $0.50.
This wider spread shows lower liquidity, higher volatility, and greater transaction costs for traders. The bid-ask spread is crucial for
high-frequency traders
or market makers because their profit margins are often derived from these small differences.
2
Price spread between securities
This spread is between the price of one stock and another. For example, the spread between the prices of common stock and preferred stock of the same company can reveal investor preferences and expectations regarding dividends, growth potential, and risk.
Similarly, the spread between different classes of stocks (such as
Class A and Class B
shares) can signal market sentiment about voting rights or control issues.
2. Bond Market Spreads
Spreads in the bond market are crucial indicators of risk, investor sentiment, and economic conditions. These spreads represent the difference between the yields of two bonds, typically reflecting varying levels of credit risk, maturity, or liquidity. Understanding bond spreads is essential for investors seeking to assess the risk-reward balance in their fixed-income portfolios.
Yield spreads
Yield or interest rate spreads arise from the difference in yields between bonds of different types or groups, maturity dates, or issuers. A prominent example is the yield spread between long-term and short-term government bonds (e.g., the 10-year Treasury yield minus the two-year
Treasury
yield), known as the ""yield curve spread."" These spreads are calculated by subtracting the yield of one instrument from another and are typically expressed in basis points (bps) or percentage points.
Yield spreads are used as a starting point for determining why there are differences in yields because of maturity, issuer, or economic conditions. For instance, a widening yield curve spread often signals expectations of economic growth, while a narrowing spread suggests concerns about an economic downturn.
3
Credit spreads
A type of yield curve spread, these are the yield differences between two bonds of similar maturity but different credit qualities, often expressed as the difference between a corporate bond and a risk-free government bond, such as a U.S. Treasury bond.
4
For example, if a
10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields
3% and a 10-year corporate bond issued by Company XYZ yields 5%, the credit spread is 2%. This spread compensates investors for the added risk of default associated with the corporate bond. A wider credit spread suggests higher perceived risk, often because of lower credit ratings or expectations of economic instability.
During the 2008 financial crisis (as seen in the chart below), credit spreads widened significantly as investors demanded more yield to compensate for the increased risk of corporate defaults.
Liquidity spreads
This is the difference in yield between two bonds that are otherwise similar but differ in how much they are traded. A bond with lower
liquidity
will typically have a higher yield to compensate investors for the difficulty in buying or selling the bond quickly without affecting its price.
Liquidity spreads widen during market stress when investors prefer more liquid assets and narrow during periods of market stability.
Swap spreads
The swap spread is the difference between the yield on a
fixed-rate bond
, such as a Treasury, and the fixed rate of an interest rate swap. This spread reflects the cost of swapping fixed-interest payments for floating ones and is used as a gauge of credit risk in the interbank market.
A widening swap spread can indicate increasing concerns about counterparty risk (the chance the other party will default) in the financial system.
Fast Fact
The interbank market is a global network where banks lend to and borrow from each other, typically on a short-term basis. It plays a crucial role in maintaining liquidity in the financial system, allowing banks to manage their daily funding needs and meet reserve requirements. Interest rates in the interbank market, such as
SOFR
, also serve as benchmarks for many other financial products.
Z-spread
The Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is the constant spread that must be added to the risk-free Treasury yield curve to discount a bond’s cash flows back to its current market price. This spread is particularly useful for bonds with complex
cash flows
, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or bonds with embedded options.
Let's take the example of a
corporate bond
trading at $105 with a face value of $100 and a 5% coupon rate. To determine the Z-spread, an investor would calculate the spread needed over the Treasury yield curve to make the present value of the bond’s cash flows equal to its market price. If the Z-spread is 1.5%, this means that over the entire Treasury yield curve, the bond offers an additional 1.5% yield to compensate for its credit risk and other factors.
The Z-spread is thus commonly used by fixed-income traders to assess the relative value of bonds, especially when comparing bonds with similar credit quality but different structures.
Option-adjusted spread (OAS)
The option-adjusted spread (OAS) refines the Z-spread by factoring in the impact of these options on the bond's value. Thus, it's the yield spread that investors would receive over a risk-free rate if a bond did not have ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp

An over-the-counter (OTC) market is decentralize and where participants trade stocks, commodities, currencies, or other instruments directly between two parties, without a central exchange or broker.
Suppose you manage a company looking to raise capital but don't meet the stringent requirements to list on a major stock exchange. Or you're an investor seeking to trade more exotic securities not offered on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. Where do you turn? Enter the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, where trading is done electronically.
OTC markets allow investors to trade stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other financial instruments directly between two parties without the supervision of a formal exchange. This freewheeling format provides prospects but also pitfalls compared with exchange-based trading. Apple Inc. (
AAPL
) and Microsoft Corporation (
MSFT
) traded OTC, as did many long-forgotten penny stocks.

In this article, we'll examine what OTC markets are, how they differ from traditional stock exchanges, and the advantages and disadvantages for investors. We'll explore the key OTC market types, the companies that tend to trade on them, and how these markets are evolving in today's electronic trading environment.
Key Takeaways
Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are those in which participants trade directly, without a central exchange or other third party.
OTC markets do not have physical locations or market-makers.
Some of the products most commonly traded OTC include stocks, bonds, derivatives, and currencies.
Most shares offered OTC are called penny stocks since they trade for less than $5 per share.
Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou
Understanding Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets
In pharmaceuticals, OTC is a category of medications that can be bought without a doctor's or pharmacist's guidance; OTC is something similar in finance since what's sold are securities that haven't passed through the supervision of a formal exchange like the Nasdaq or NYSE.
OTC markets have a long history, dating back to the early days of stock trading in the 17th century. Before the establishment of formal exchanges, most securities were traded over the counter. As exchanges became more prevalent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, OTC trading remained a significant part of the financial ecosystem. They have always had a reputation for where you find the dodgiest deals and enterprises, but might also find future profit-makers among them.
Since the exchanges take in much of the legitimate investment capital, stocks listed on them have far greater liquidity. OTC securities, meanwhile, often have very low liquidity, which means just a few trades can change their prices fast, leading to significant volatility. This has made the OTC markets a breeding ground for
pump-and-dump schemes
and other frauds that have long kept the enforcement division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) busy.
2
Brief History of OTC Markets
In the U.S., the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), later the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), was established in 1939 to regulate the OTC market. While NASD evolved into an electronic quotation platform in 1971 and subsequently a formal exchange, before then, the OTC stock market operated through a network of ""
market makers
"" who facilitated trades between investors.
The trading process during this era was cumbersome and inefficient. Investors had to manually contact multiple market makers by phone to compare prices and find the best deal. This made it impossible to establish a fixed stock price at any given time, impeding the ability to track price changes and overall market trends. These issues supplied obvious openings for less scrupulous market participants.
Traders also looked to the
Pink Sheets
, now known as OTC Markets Group, over a century ago as a paper-based system for trading unlisted securities. The term ""Pink Sheets"" derived from the pink-colored paper on which the bid and ask prices of these securities were printed and circulated. In the late 1990s, Pink Sheets transitioned to an electronic quotation system, eventually becoming the OTC Markets Group, which operates the OTCQX, OTCQB, and OTC Pink platforms.
Today, these platforms offer access to shares and other securities for a wide range of companies, from well-established foreign firms to small, emerging companies that don't yet meet the listing requirements of major exchanges. The shares for many major foreign companies trade OTC in the U.S. through American depositary receipts (
ADRs
). These securities represent ownership in the shares of a foreign company. They are issued by a U.S. depositary bank, providing U.S. investors with exposure to foreign companies without the need to directly purchase shares on a foreign exchange.
While OTC markets offer greater flexibility and fewer barriers to entry than traditional exchanges, they also come with exceptional risks and challenges. FINRA regulates broker-dealers in the U.S. OTC markets.
3
Nevertheless, because OTC-traded securities are subject to less stringent reporting and disclosure requirements, investors may have limited access to reliable information about the companies they are investing in. Below is a table distinguishing the differences between trading OTC and on a regulated exchange.
Trading on Exchanges vs. OTC
Feature
Exchange
OTC
Trading Platform
Centralized exchange (e.g., NYSE, Nasdaq) with a physical or virtual location.
A decentralized network of dealers and brokers, no central location.
Pricing
Prices are determined through auctions (
bid/ask
pricing).
Prices are negotiated between buyers and sellers.
Transparency
High transparency. Trades are publicly reported, and price information is readily available.
Less transparency. Trades are not publicly reported, and price information may be less readily available.
Regulation
Regulated by government agencies (e.g., SEC, CFTC) and the exchanges themselves.
Less regulated, with some oversight by agencies like FINRA.
Liquidity
Generally, higher
liquidity
because of the market makers and a larger pool of participants.
Liquidity can vary significantly depending on the security and market conditions.
Standardization
Standardized contract terms and sizes.
Less standardized. Contracts can be customized.
Counterparty Risk
The exchange acts as a central counterparty, guaranteeing the trades.
Higher counterparty risk. Investors rely on the creditworthiness of the other party.
Transaction Costs
Generally lower due to standardized contracts and greater competition among market makers.
Can be higher due to negotiation and wider bid-ask spreads.
Assets
Stocks, bonds, options, and futures.
Various securities, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, currencies (including crypto), commodities, and structured products.
Accessibility
Easily accessible, including to retail investors.
Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and other major brokers now provide access to OTC markets via their platforms for retail investors.
OTC Markets
OTC Stocks
There are several OTC markets in the U.S., including the following:
OTCQX
: The top-tier OTC market with more stringent financial and reporting requirements.
OTCQB
: Also called the ""Venture Market,"" this tier has less stringent requirements than OTCQX but more than the Pink Open Market.
Pink Open Market
: Formerly known on Wall Street as the ""
Pink Sheets
,"" this market has the least stringent requirements and includes many small, speculative companies.
OTC Foreign Company Shares
OTC markets provide access to securities not listed on major exchanges, including shares of foreign companies. This allows investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to
international markets
and companies that may not be available through traditional exchanges.
Trading foreign shares directly on their local exchanges can be logistically challenging and expensive for individual investors. OTC markets offer a more convenient and cost-effective way to invest in foreign companies since trades are executed in U.S. dollars during U.S. trading hours, often with lower commissions than trading directly on foreign exchanges.
For foreign companies, cross-listing in OTC markets like the
OTCQX
can attract a broader base of U.S. investors, potentially increasing trading volume and narrowing bid-ask spreads. Some foreign companies trade OTC to avoid the stringent reporting and compliance requirements of listing on major U.S. exchanges. OTC markets, while regulated, generally have less strict li",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp

What Is a Yankee Bond?
A Yankee bond is a debt obligation issued by a foreign entity, such as a government or company, which is traded in the United States and denominated in U.S. dollars.
key takeaways
A Yankee bond is a debt obligation denominated in U.S. dollars that is publicly issued in the U.S. by foreign banks and corporation, and sometimes even governments.
Yankee bonds are subject to U.S. securities laws, as they trade on U.S. exchanges.
Yankee bonds offer the issuer to chance to get cheaper financing and reach a broader investment audience; they offer investors the chance for better yields.
On the downside, Yankee bonds can take a long time to come to market, subjecting them to interest rate risk; they are also vulnerable to currency risk and other problems in their home country's economy.
Understanding a Yankee Bond
Yankee bonds are governed by the
Securities Act of 1933
, which requires the bonds to be registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
before being offered for sale. Yankee bonds are frequently issued in tranches, individual portions of a larger debt offering or structured financing arrangement that have differing risk levels, interest rates and maturities, and offerings may be extremely large, as much as $1 billion.
There are also
Yankee certificate of deposits
, CDs that are issued in the United States by a branch or agency of a foreign bank.
Advantages of Yankee Bonds
Yankee bonds can represent a win-win opportunity for both issuers and investors. One of the primary potential advantages for a Yankee bond issuer is the opportunity to obtain cheaper financing capital at a lower cost if comparable bond rates in the United States are significantly lower than the current rates in a foreign company’s own country. The size of the U.S.
bond market
and the fact U.S. investors very actively trade it also confers an advantage for the issuer, especially if the bond offering is a large one. Although U.S. regulatory requirements may initially hamper a foreign issuer in regard to obtaining approval to offer bonds, conditions for lending in the United States may still be less stringent overall than those in the issuer’s own country, allowing the issuer greater flexibility in terms of the offering.
A major advantage for U.S. investors in Yankee bonds is such bonds frequently offer higher yields than the yields available on comparable, or even lower-rated, bond issues from U.S. issuers. Another potential advantage is the fact that Yankee bonds offer investors a means of obtaining international diversification in a portfolio of bond investments. Yankee bonds also offer U.S. investors an advantage over investing in foreign corporation bond issues made in the foreign company’s home country. Since Yankee bonds are
denominated in U.S. dollars
, the currency risk commonly associated with foreign bond investments is virtually eliminated.
Disadvantages of Yankee Bonds
One of the drawbacks of Yankee bonds for issuers is the time involved. Because of strict U.S. regulations for the issuing of such bonds, it can take more than three months for a Yankee bond issue to be approved for sale. The approval process includes an evaluation of the issuer’s
creditworthiness
by a debt-rating agency such as Moody’s or
Standard & Poor’s
.
Another consideration is the interest rate environment. Foreign issuers usually favor issuing Yankee bonds when there is a low-interest-rate environment in the United States, since that means the issuer can offer the bond with lower interest payments. But should something send interest rates soaring or plummeting in three months, it could mess up the carefully calibrated pricing of the Yankee bond, affecting how well it sells.
Finally, a Yankee bond can be affected by the economy of its home country. So if that country has a shaky economy, its price could topple, or the issuer could run into problems—which could affect its coupon payments. And while the Yankee bond is issued in dollars, it could be vulnerable to some currency risk as well, as a nation's economic woes often affect its money's performance in the foreign exchange markets.

What Is Earnings Per Share (EPS)?
Earnings per share (EPS) is a commonly used measure of a company's profitability. It indicates how much profit each outstanding share of common stock has earned. Generally speaking, the higher a company's EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.
EPS is calculated by dividing a company's net income by the total number of outstanding shares.
Key Takeaways
Earnings per share (EPS) is a company's net income subtracted by preferred dividends and then divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding.
EPS indicates how much money a company makes
for each share of its stock
and is a widely used metric for estimating corporate value.
A higher EPS indicates greater value because investors will pay more for a company's shares if they think the company has higher profits relative to its share price.
EPS can be arrived at in several forms, such as excluding extraordinary items or discontinued operations, or on a diluted basis.
Like other financial metrics, earnings per share is most valuable when compared against competitor metrics, companies of the same industry, or across a period of time.

Earnings Per Share Equation
Earnings per share value is calculated as net income (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. A more refined calculation adjusts the numerator and denominator for shares that could be created through options, convertible debt, or warrants. The numerator of the equation is also more relevant if it is adjusted for continuing operations.
Earnings per Share
=
Net Income
−
Preferred Dividends
End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding
\text{Earnings per Share}=\frac{\text{Net Income }-\text{ Preferred Dividends}}{\text{End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding}}
Earnings per Share

End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding

Preferred Dividends
​
To calculate a company's EPS, the balance sheet and income statement are used to find the period-end number of common shares, dividends paid on preferred stock (if any), and the net income or earnings.
It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term because the number of shares can change over time. Understanding how to find EPS is crucial for evaluating a company's profitability.
Any stock dividends or splits that occur must be reflected in the calculation of the weighted average number of
shares outstanding
. Some data sources simplify the calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a period.

What Does Earnings Per Share (EPS) Indicate?
Earnings per share is one of the most important financial metrics employed when determining a firm's profitability on an absolute basis. It is also a major component of calculating the
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
, where the E in P/E refers to EPS. By dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share, an investor can see the
value of a stock
in terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.
Earnings per share shows an investor how to pick stocks, when used along with other indicators. If you have an interest in stock trading or investing, your next step is to choose a
broker
that works for your investment style.
Comparing EPS in absolute terms may not have much meaning to investors because ordinary shareholders do not have direct access to the earnings. Instead, investors will compare EPS with the share price of the stock to determine the value of earnings and how investors feel about future growth.
Example of EPS
Say that the calculation of EPS for three companies at the end of the fiscal year was as follows:
EPS Example
Company
Net Income
Preferred Dividends
Weighted Common Shares
Basic EPS
Company A
$7.6B
$0
3.98B
$7.6/3.98 = $1.91
Company B
$18.23B
$1.61B
10.2B
$18.23-$1.61/10.2 = $1.63
Company C
$1.67B
$0
0.541B
$1.67/0.541 = $3.09
Basic EPS vs. Diluted EPS
The
formula
in the table above calculates the
basic EPS
of each of these select companies. Basic EPS does not factor in the dilutive effect of shares that could be issued by the company. When the capital structure of a company includes items such as stock options, warrants, or restricted stock units (RSU), these investments—if exercised—could increase the total number of shares outstanding in the market.
To better illustrate the effects of additional securities on per-share earnings, companies also report the
diluted EPS
, which assumes that all shares that could be outstanding have been issued.
For example, say the total number of shares that could be created and issued from Company C's convertible instruments at fiscal year-end was 23 million. If this number is added to its total shares outstanding, its diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 541 million + 23 million = 564 million shares. The company's diluted EPS is, therefore, $1.67 billion /.564 million = $2.96.
Sometimes an adjustment to the numerator is required when calculating a fully diluted EPS. For example, sometimes a lender will provide a loan that allows them to convert the debt into shares under certain conditions.
The shares that would be created by the convertible debt should be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation, but if that happened, then the company wouldn’t have paid interest on the debt. In this case, the company or analyst will add the interest paid on convertible debt back into the numerator of the EPS calculation so the result isn’t distorted.
EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items
Earnings per share can be distorted, both intentionally and unintentionally, by several factors. Analysts use variations of the basic EPS formula to avoid the most common ways that EPS may be inflated.
Imagine a company that owns two factories that make cell phone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the past few years. The company’s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm.
Though this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an “extraordinary item” because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future. Shareholders might be misled if the windfall is included in the numerator of the EPS equation, so it is excluded.
A similar argument could be made if a company had an
unusual loss
—maybe the factory burned down—which would have temporarily decreased EPS and should be excluded for the same reason.
The Formula for EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items Is:
EPS
=
Net Income

(

​
EPS From Continuing Operations
A company started the year with 500 stores and had an EPS of $5.00. However, assume that this company closed 100 stores over that period and ended the year with 400 stores. An analyst will want to know what the EPS was for just the 400 stores the company plans to continue with into the next period.
In this example, that could increase the EPS because the 100 closed stores were perhaps operating at a loss. By evaluating EPS from continuing operations, an analyst is better able to compare prior performance to current performance.
EPS and Capital
An important aspect of EPS that is often ignored is the capital that is required to generate the earnings (net income) in the calculation. Two companies could generate the same EPS, but one could do so with fewer net assets; that company would be more efficient at using its capital to generate income and, all other things being equal, would be a ""better"" company in terms of efficiency. A metric that can be used to identify more efficient companies is the
return on equity
(ROE).
EPS and Dividends
Although EPS is widely used as a way to track a company’s performance, shareholders do not have direct access to those profits. A portion of the earnings may be distributed as a ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp

An exchange rate is the value at which one currency can be exchanged for another.
What Is an Exchange Rate?
An exchange rate is the value of a nation’s
currency
when it is traded for another currency. The relative strength or weakness of a nation’s currency has a strong impact on its trade with other nations, on its tourism industry, and on the prices its consumers pay for imports.
Exchange rates
are always viewed in relation to the exchange rate of another currency. For example, the exchange rate from U.S. dollars to euros was 1.07 at the end of June 2024. That means one euro could be exchanged for $1.07.
1
Key Takeaways
An exchange rate is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another currency.
Most exchange rates are defined as floating. Their values rise or fall based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.
Some exchange rates are
pegged
or fixed to the value of a specific country’s currency.
Movements in a nation’s exchange rate change the real cost of the supplies that are purchased from abroad, the cost of imports that its consumers buy, and the level of demand for the nation’s products overseas.
Understanding Exchange Rates
The exchange rate between any two currencies is commonly determined by interest rates, economic activity, gross domestic product, and the unemployment rate in each of the countries.
Commonly called market exchange rates, currency prices are set in the global marketplace where financial institutions, money managers, and speculators
trade currencies
around the clock. This is called the forex or f/x market, although the market has no physical presence and no owner. Changes in rates can occur hourly or daily with small changes or in large incremental shifts.
2
An exchange rate is commonly quoted using an acronym for the national currency it represents. USD represents the U.S. dollar. EUR represents the euro. It would be EUR/USD if you were quoting the currency pair for the dollar and the euro.

Important
An exchange of U.S. dollars to Japanese yen is labeled as
USD/JPY
. An exchange rate of 100 means that one dollar equals 100 yen.
How Exchange Rates Fluctuate
Exchange rates can be
free-floating or fixed
. A free-floating exchange rate rises and falls due to changes in the
foreign exchange market
. A fixed exchange rate is
pegged
to the value of another currency. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar in a range of 7.75 to 7.85, so the value of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar will remain within this range.
3
Exchange rates have a
spot rate
or cash value that’s the current market value. They may also have a forward value that’s based on expectations for the currency to rise or fall vs. its spot price.
Forward rate values
fluctuate
due to changes in expectations for future interest rates in one country vs. another. Traders may buy the dollar vs. the euro if they speculate that the eurozone will ease monetary policy vs. the U.S., causing a downward trend in the value of the euro.
Exchange Rate Examples
A traveler to Germany from the United States wants $200 for the equivalent amount of euros on arrival in Germany. The sell rate is the rate at which a
traveler sells foreign currency
in exchange for local currency. The buy rate is the rate at which one buys foreign currency back from travelers to exchange it for local currency.
If the current exchange rate is 1.05, $200 will net €190.48 in return. In this case, the equation is: dollars ÷ exchange rate = euro:
$200 ÷ 1.05 = €190.48
Suppose €66 is remaining after the trip. The change from euros to dollars will be $67.32 if the exchange rate has dropped to 1.02:
€66 × 1.02 = $67.32
The Japanese yen is calculated differently. The dollar is placed in front of the yen in this case, as in USD/JPY. The equation for USD/JPY is dollars × exchange rate = yen.
A traveler to Japan would get ¥11,000 if they want to convert $100 into yen and the exchange rate is 110. Convert the yen back into dollars by dividing the amount of the currency by the exchange rate:
$100 × 110 = ¥11,000.00
-or-
¥11,000.00/110 = $100
Note that none of these travelers will be getting the market price when they exchange currency. The bank or currency exchange store that they do business with will add its fee to the transaction.
How Do Exchange Rates Affect the Supply and Demand of Goods?
Changes in exchange rates affect businesses by increasing or decreasing the cost of supplies and finished products that are purchased from another country. It changes, for better or worse, the demand abroad for their exports and the domestic demand for imports. Significant changes in a currency rate can encourage or discourage foreign tourism and investment in a country.
What Is the Forex?
The
forex market
, also known as the f/x, is an over-the-counter marketplace for trading currencies. This 24-hour market is responsible for trillions of dollars in daily trading activity as central banks, financial institutions, and speculators swap currencies to profit from their price movements or hedge against future price movements.
What Is a Restricted Currency?
A restricted currency has its value set by the government.
Some countries have restricted currencies, meaning they restrict the exchange of their currency to within their borders or establish both an onshore rate and an offshore rate.
China is an example. The Chinese government sets a midpoint value for the currency every day, allowing the yuan to trade in a band of 2% from this midpoint.
4
The Bottom Line
An exchange rate is the value of one currency in relation to the value of another currency. Most exchange rates are floating and rise or fall based on the supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, but some are pegged to another country’s currency or are fixed in value.
Fluctuations in a nation’s exchange rate have an impact on the demand for its products abroad and the prices its consumers pay for imports.

Investopedia,"January Effect: What It Is in the Stock Market, Possible Causes","Close
Definition
The January effect is the supposed increase in stock prices in the first month of the year.
The January effect is the name given to the belief in a seasonal increase in stock prices in the first month of each year. People have generally attributed a supposed rally each January to the rise in buying that follows the price drop that typically happens each December. However, data for this phenomenon over the last several decades has proven inconclusive.
Key Takeaways
The January effect is the supposed seasonal tendency for stocks to rise in the first month of the year.
The January effect is said to occur when investors sell losing stocks in December for tax-loss harvesting and repurchase them after the New Year.
Like other market anomalies and calendar effects where sentiment and nonrational motives appear at work, the January effect is considered by some as evidence against the efficient markets hypothesis.
The argument for the effect is that at the end of each year, investors tend to sell off securities at a loss to offset their capital gains and lower their tax bills, prompting a sell-off. After the New Year, they repurchase the stocks, creating a greater demand for a range of shares in the market, leading to the January effect.
1
2
Another explanation for the phenomenon is that investors use year-end cash bonuses to buy investments the following month.
While this market anomaly has been identified in the past, the January effect has disappeared in recent years, if it ever existed, and studies of previous eras have shown it correlated less with lower prices in December than with continuing bullishness during the last months of the previous year.
1
In short, the evidence doesn't seem to match the explanations.
Rebecca Walser, named by Investopedia as a top advisor for 2023, doesn't think there's much to the theory. But, she added, if there's anything to it, she would ""attribute it much more to human psychology than tax loss harvesting or mutual fund window dressing.""
Another Investopedia top advisor,
Preston D. Cherry
, agrees with Walser, calling it little more than ""a folktale."" But Cherry said there was much to learn from the supposed ""effect"": ""Investors must follow a disciplined and tailored investment strategy unique to their goals, risk tolerance and capacity,"" he told Investopedia. ""The best long-term investment strategies have a consistent commitment and a why attached to the action rather than following the herd.""

Understanding the January Effect
Investment banker Sidney Wachtel is said to have first noticed the January effect in 1942.
3
Like all calendar-related effects, the hypothesis suggests that the markets are inefficient since efficient markets would naturally make this effect disappear.
Our own look back at the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (
SPY
) since its 1993 inception makes one wonder how the term ever came to be used. Of the 31 years since, there have been 18 winning January months (58%) and 13 losing January months (42%), making the odds of a gain slightly higher than the flip of a coin.
4
2
Further, from the start of the 2009 market rally through January 2024, January months showed eight positive vs. eight losing months, a 46% to 54% ratio. Given the strong rally since 2009, one might rightly expect a more pronounced number of January winners, but this has not been the case.
The first month of the year turns out not to be a particularly compelling trading month out of the year, with middling performance at best. Historically, according to data cited by Nasdaq, it's been in positive territory but ranks eighth out of the 12 months over the last 20 years.
2
Tip
The
efficient market hypothesis
argues that share prices reflect all the information that is available to the market. Based on the theory, since all market participants have access to the same information, outperforming the market through stock selection or market timing is not practical. The efficient market hypothesis is an argument against seasonal phenomena like the January effect.
January Effect Explanations
Besides tax-loss harvesting with post-New Year repurchases and investors putting cash bonuses into the market, another explanation for the January effect has to do with investor psychology. Some investors argue that January is the best month to begin an investment program or that many are following through on a New Year's resolution to begin investing for the future.
3
Others have posited that mutual fund managers buy the stocks of top performers at the end of the year and get rid of losing assets for the sake of appearances in their year-end reports, an activity known as ""
window dressing
."" This is unlikely, however, since trading would primarily affect large caps, and the effect, when found, has been seen as greater in small caps.
5
Year-end sell-offs could attract buyers interested in the lower prices, knowing that the dips are not based on company fundamentals. On a wide enough scale, this could drive prices higher in January.
6
Tip
Jeffrey Hirsch, who took over editing the annual
Stock Trader's Almanac
for this father, who named many of the best known calendar effects (the
Santa Claus rally
, etc.), cautioned against being too literal in trading on the history of any of them. ""They're not automatic,"" Hirsch says. ""Buy this day, sell that day...You gotta see what's going on on the ground. You've got to do some homework.""
Studies on the January Effect
Studies on the January effect generally back Walser's view. The effect has long been one of the wider-known market anomalies, so it's no surprise that it's given rise to a wealth of studies. A look back should give us some humility when citing truisms about the market—like the dumping of stocks in December leads to a bullish market in January—that have become outdated or might have been misidentified by previous researchers in the first place. For example, as we've seen, it's never been clear that sell-offs in December led to purchases in January since the better-traded January months correlate to better December trading months, not those that had massive sell-offs.
2
Early research by Rozeff and Kinney highlighted that this stock market's seasonal anomaly could be linked to patterns in investor behavior, such as tax-loss selling in December followed by reinvestment in January.
7
Later, Keim expanded on this idea, suggesting that institutional window-dressing and individual tax strategies played a role, particularly for small cap stocks. Additionally there was Haugen and Jorion who compounded the narrative by associating the January Effect with behavioral finance factors like overreaction and seasonal portfolio adjustments.
8
9
Subsequent studies have reinforced and broadened the industry's understanding of the January Effect. In 2005, Haug and Hirschey found that the anomaly persisted even after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, indicating that other drivers beyond tax-related behavior could be influencing the effect.
10
Lakshya Batta explored the phenomenon's global consistency and suggested additional explanations such as performance hedging and seasonal liquidity.
11
Furthermore, research published delved into cross-sectional impacts, demonstrating that sentiment driven stocks earned higher returns in January, supporting the behavioral finance argument.
12
Indeed, the January Effect is not confined to the US, as Tyler Folliott's global study showed. While the effect was significant in some markets, it varied globally, with other anomalies, like a September Effect, also emerging.
13
In this world of finance and investing the January Effect remains a fascinating and complex market anomaly that continues to evolve under the influence of investor behavior and market dynamics.
Criticisms of the January Effect
January effect skeptics have primarily focused on the lack of recent data showing its continuing impact, problems identifying its causes, and how it's become moot given the evolution of financial markets. Let's take these in turn:
Diminishing significance
: Most studies show that the January effect has become less pronounced. Other than suggesting the effect wasn't real to begin with, one idea is that as investors became aware of this trend, they adjusted their strategies accordingly, which decreased its influence over time. This suggests that the January effect may be more of a historical anomaly than a reliable market indicator.
14
Impact of market efficiency
: The efficient market hypothesis argues that it is impossible to outperform the stock market because the market will ""catch up"" to reflect all relevant information. Momentary anomalies are just that, and this is more so with the advent of high-frequency trading and sophisticated algorithms that would exploit and correct for the January effect if it existed.
15
The effect is related to small-cap stocks
: Some have sought to rescue some form of the January effect by pointing to this or that part of the market as having data to back it up. Several studies have observed the effect in small-cap stocks, which are generally more volatile and riskier. This raises questions about the broader applicability of the effect across different market segments and whether one can make any risk-adjusted returns exploiting it.
16
Problems with the tax-loss harvesting hypothesis
: Some have argued that the January effect results from investors selling securities at a loss in December for tax purposes, then buying them back in January, artificially inflating prices. Critics point out that this behavior is inconsistent each year, though the tax conditions are and would vary for individual traders anyway, given their specific tax situations and broad",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/januaryeffect.asp
Investopedia,Total Shareholder Return (TSR): Definition and Formula,"Close
Definition
Total shareholder return (TSR) looks at capital gains and dividends to measure the full amount an investor earns from a stock.
Total shareholder return (TSR) is a measure of financial performance, indicating the total amount an investor reaps from an investment—specifically, equities or shares of stock. To arrive at its total, usually expressed as a percentage, TSR factors in
capital gains
and
dividends
from a stock; it might also include special distributions, stock splits, and warrants.
Whichever way it is calculated, TSR means the same thing: the sum total of what a stock has returned to those who invested in it.
Key Takeaways
Total shareholder return (TSR) measures financial performance and indicates the total amount an investor reaps from an investment—specifically, equities or shares of stock.
Total shareholder return factors in capital gains and dividends when measuring the total return generated by a stock.
The formula for calculating TSR is { (current price - purchase price) + dividends } ÷ purchase price.
TSR represents an easily understood figure of the overall financial benefits generated for stockholders.
TSR is a good gauge of an investment’s long-term value, but it only looks back to past performance.
Understanding Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
An investor makes money from stock in two basic ways: capital gains and current income. A capital gain is a change in the market price of the stock from the time it was purchased to the date it was sold (or the current price if it is still owned)—profits, in other words.
Current income
is the dividends paid out by the company from its earnings while the investor still owns the stock.
When calculating TSR, an investor can only consider the dividends they actually received or were eligible to receive. For example, they may be in possession of the stock on the day the dividend is payable, yet they receive the dividend only if they owned the stock on or before the
ex-dividend date
. Therefore, an investor needs to know the stock’s ex-dividend date rather than the dividend payment date when calculating TSR.
Fast Fact
Dividends, which are per-share distributions of some of a company’s
earnings
to certain classes of its stockholders, can include one-time payments or regular quarterly or semiannual cash payouts. Besides dividends, another way that companies return cash to shareholders is through
stock buyback
programs.
TSR is most useful when measured over time, as it shows the long-term value of an investment, the most accurate metric for gauging success for most individual
investors
.
Examples of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
Total shareholder return is calculated as the overall
appreciation
in the stock’s price per share, plus any dividends paid by the company, during a particular measured interval; this sum is then divided by the initial purchase price of the stock to arrive at the TSR.
As a mathematical equation, it would be:
TSR
=
(
Current Price
−
Purchase Price
)
+
Dividends
Purchase Price
\begin{aligned}&\text{TSR} = \frac { ( \text{Current Price} - \text{Purchase Price} ) + \text{Dividends} }{ \text{Purchase Price} } \\\end{aligned}
​
TSR
=
Purchase Price
(
Current Price
−
Purchase Price
)
+
Dividends
​
​
Hypothetical Example of TSR
As an example, let’s assume that an investor bought 100 shares of a company’s
stock
at $20 per share (for a total investment of $2,000). The stock, which they still own, is now trading at $24 per share. Since the investor bought the stock two years ago, the company has paid out a total of $4.50 in dividends per share.
What is the investor’s TSR over those two years? It would be calculated as:
$24 - $20 (current share price minus original purchase price) = 4
plus
$4.50 (the amount of dividends per share received) = 8.5
divided by
$20 (original per-share purchase price) = 0.425
multiplied by
100 to get a percentage = 42.5%
So, the TSR would be 42.5%. As an equation:

Note: If you prefer to think of TSR in dollar terms vs. percentage, you would simply do the first two steps above, to have $8.50 per share as your total shareholder return, aka “stock return cash value” as it’s called in this form.
Real-Life Example of TSR
For the period of 2021 through 2024, Microsoft Corp. (
MSFT
) had a TSR of 19.9% for investors who had held it for that entire period. Of that amount, 19.2% came from an increase in share price, and 0.7% was returned from dividends.
1
Important
TSR can also be considered the
internal rate of return (IRR)
of all cash flows to an investor during the
period they’ve held
their shares.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
TSR is best used when analyzing
venture capital
and
private equity
investments. These investments typically involve multiple cash investments over the life of the business and a single cash outflow at the end through an
initial public offering (IPO)
or sale.
Because TSR is expressed as a percentage, the figure is readily comparable with industry benchmarks or companies in the same sector. However, it reflects the past overall return to shareholders without consideration of future returns.
TSR represents an easily understood figure of the overall financial benefits generated for stockholders. The figure measures how the market evaluates the overall performance of a company over a specific time period. However, TSR is calculated for publicly traded companies at the overall level, not at a divisional level.
In addition, TSR is externally focused and reflects the market’s perception of performance; therefore, TSR could be adversely affected if a fundamentally strong company’s share price suffers greatly in the
short term
for whatever reason—like negative publicity or quirky stock market behavior or sentiment.
TSR does not measure the absolute size of an
investment
or its
return
. For this reason, TSR may favor investments with high rates of return even when the dollar amount of the return is small. For example, a $1 investment returning $3 has a higher TSR than a $1 million investment returning $2 million. In addition, TSR does not take into consideration the cost of capital and cannot compare investments over different time periods.
Pros
Simple to calculate, easy to understand
More complete evaluation of investment’s worth
Easy to compare to other companies or benchmarks
Good gauge of long-term performance
Cons
Limited to past performance, no sense of future returns
Sensitive to stock market performance, like nearly any
metric
Doesn’t reflect size of investment
What Is Total Shareholder Return?
Total shareholder return (TSR) is a way to evaluate an investment’s performance. It factors in capital gains and dividends to measure the overall returns an investor earns from a stock.
How Is TSR Measured?
TSR, short for total shareholder return, measures the appreciation in the price of a stock’s shares, plus the total sum paid in dividends per share, over a specific time period.
How Do You Calculate Total Shareholder Return?
To calculate total shareholder return (TSR), first, subtract a stock’s current price per share from the price originally paid for it. Then add the dollar amount of dividends received per share, along with any other special distributions or payouts (like from a stock buyback, for example). Divide this sum by the stock’s purchase price per share. Multiply by 100 to arrive at a percentage figure for the TSR.
The Bottom Line
Total shareholder return (TSR) is a way to determine how much your investment has made for you—how much additional money your capital has earned in a specific time period. It takes into account both appreciation in a stock’s shares and the dividends paid on those shares. It has its limitations—what financial metric does not?—but overall, it provides a more complete sense of your return on a stock than simply gauging the gain in the stock price.

What Are International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)?
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a set of accounting rules for the financial statements of public companies that are intended to make them consistent, transparent, and easily comparable around the world.
IFRS currently has complete profiles for 168 jurisdictions, including those in the European Union. The United States uses a different system, the
generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP).
1
The IFRS is issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The IFRS system is sometimes confused with the
International Accounting Standards
(IAS), which are the older standards that the IFRS replaced in 2001.
2
Key Takeaways
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were created to bring consistency and integrity to accounting standards and practices, regardless of the company or the country.
They were issued by the London-based Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and address record keeping, account reporting, and other aspects of financial reporting.
The IFRS system replaced the International Accounting Standards (IAS) in 2001.
IFRS fosters greater corporate transparency.
IFRS are not used by all countries; for example, the U.S. uses generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin
Understanding International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS specify in detail how companies must maintain their records and report their expenses and income. They were established to create a common accounting language that could be understood globally by investors, auditors, government regulators, and other interested parties.
The standards are designed to bring consistency to accounting language, practices, and statements, and to help businesses and investors make educated
financial analyses
and decisions.
They were developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, which is part of the not-for-profit, London-based IFRS Foundation. The Foundation says it sets the standards to “bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets around the world.""
3
IFRS vs. GAAP
Public companies in the U.S. are required to use a rival system, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The GAAP standards were developed by the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FSAB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
The
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) has said it won't switch to International Financial Reporting Standards but will continue reviewing a proposal to allow IFRS information to supplement U.S. financial filings.
4
There are differences between
IFRS and GAAP reporting
. For example, IFRS is not as strict in defining revenue and allows companies to report revenue sooner. A balance sheet using this system might show a higher stream of revenue than a GAAP version of the same balance sheet.
IFRS also has different requirements for reporting expenses. For example, if a company is spending money on development or on investment for the future, it doesn't necessarily have to be reported as an expense. It can be capitalized instead.
Standard IFRS Requirements
IFRS covers a wide range of accounting activities. There are certain aspects of business practice for which IFRS set mandatory rules.
Statement of financial position
: This is the
balance sheet
. IFRS influences the ways in which the components of a balance sheet are reported.
Statement of comprehensive income
: This can take the form of one statement or be separated into a
profit and loss statement
and a statement of other income, including property and equipment.
Statement of changes in equity:
Also known as a statement of retained earnings, this documents the company's change in earnings or profit for the given financial period.
Statement of cash flows
: This report summarizes the company's financial transactions in the given period, separating cash flow into operations, investing, and financing.
5
In addition to these basic reports, a company must give a summary of its accounting policies. The full report is often seen side by side with the previous report to show the changes in profit and loss.
6
A parent company must create separate account reports for each of its subsidiary companies.
Note
Chinese companies do not use IFRS or GAAP. They use Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBEs).
7
History of IFRS
IFRS originated in the European Union with the intention of making business affairs and accounts accessible across the continent. It was quickly adopted as a common accounting language.
Although the U.S. and some other countries don't use IFRS, currently 168 jurisdictions do, making IFRS the most-used set of standards globally.
1
Who Uses IFRS?
IFRS is required to be used by public companies based in 168 jurisdictions, including all of the nations in the European Union as well as Canada, India, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, and Chile. The U.S. and China each have their own systems.
1
How Does IFRS Differ From GAAP?
The two systems have the same goal: clarity and honesty in financial reporting by publicly-traded companies. IFRS was designed as a standards-based approach that could be used internationally. GAAP is a rules-based system used primarily in the U.S.
Although most of the world uses IFRS standards, it is still not part of the U.S. financial accounting world. The SEC continues to review switching to the IFRS but has yet to do so.
Several methodological differences exist between the two systems. For instance, GAAP allows a company to use either of two inventory cost methods: First in, First out (FIFO) or Last in, First out (LIFO). LIFO, however, is
banned under IFRS
.
Why Is IFRS Important?
IFRS fosters transparency and trust in the global financial markets and the companies that list their shares on them. If such standards did not exist, investors would be more reluctant to believe the financial statements and other information presented to them by companies. Without that trust, we might see fewer transactions and a less robust economy.
IFRS also helps investors analyze companies by making it easier to perform “apples to apples” comparisons between one company and another, and for
fundamental analysis
of a company's performance.
The Bottom Line
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are accounting rules for public companies with the goal of making company financial statements consistent, transparent, and easily comparable around the world. This helps with auditing, tax purposes, and investing.

What Is a Zero-Beta Portfolio?
A zero-beta portfolio is a portfolio constructed to have zero systematic risk, or in other words, a beta of zero. A zero-beta portfolio would have the same expected return as the risk-free rate. Such a portfolio would have zero correlation with market movements, given that its expected return equals the
risk-free rate
or a relatively low
rate of return
compared to higher-beta portfolios.
A zero-beta portfolio is quite unlikely to attract investor interest in bull markets since such a portfolio has no market exposure and would, therefore,
underperform
a diversified
market portfolio
. It may attract some interest during a bear market, but investors are likely to question whether merely investing in risk-free, short-term treasuries is a better and cheaper alternative to a zero-cost portfolio. In theory, building a
zero-investment portfolio
to completely eliminate risk is unachievable.
Key Takeaways
A zero-beta portfolio is constructed to have zero systematic risk—a beta of zero.
Beta measures an investment's sensitivity to a price movement of a specifically referenced market index.
Zero-beta portfolios have no market exposure so are unlikely to attract investor interest in bull markets, since such portfolios would underperform diversified market portfolios.
Understanding Zero-Beta Portfolios
Beta and Formula
Beta measures a stock's (or other security's) sensitivity to a price movement of a specifically referenced market index. This statistic measures if the investment is more or less volatile compared to the market index it is being measured against.
A beta of more than one indicates that the investment is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than one indicates the investment is less volatile than the market. Negative betas are possible and indicate that the investment moves in an opposite direction than the particular market measure.
For example, imagine a large-cap stock. It's possible that this stock could have a beta of 0.97 versus the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 index (a large-cap stock index) while simultaneously having a beta of 0.7 versus the Russell 2000 index (a small-cap stock index). At the same time, it could be possible the company would have a negative beta to a very unrelated index, such as an emerging market debt index.
The formula for beta is:
Beta = Covariance of Market Return with Stock Return / Variance of Market Return
A Simple Zero-Beta Example
As a simple example of a zero-beta portfolio, consider the following. A portfolio manager wants to construct a zero-beta portfolio versus the S&P 500 index. The manager has $5 million to invest and is considering the following investment choices:
Stock 1
: has a beta of 0.95
Stock 2
: has a beta of 0.55
Bond 1
: has a beta of 0.2
Bond 2
: has a beta of -0.5
Commodity 1
: has a beta of -0.8
If the investment manager allocated capital in the following way, he would create a portfolio with a beta of approximately zero:
Stock 1:
$700,000 (14% of the portfolio; a weighted-beta of 0.133)
Stock 2
: $1,400,000 (28% of the portfolio; a weighted-beta of 0.154)
Bond 1
: $400,000 (8% of the portfolio; a weighted-beta of 0.016)
Bond 2
: $1 million (20% of the portfolio; a weighted-beta of -0.1)
Commodity 1
: $1.5 million (30% of the portfolio; a weighted-beta of -0.24)
This portfolio would have a beta of -0.037, which would be considered a near-zero beta portfolio.

Investopedia,"Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC): Definition, Taxes, and Example","Close
Definition
A qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC) is a deferred annuity that allows fund conversions from a qualified retirement plan or IRA into guaranteed future monthly payments.
What Is a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)?
QLAC stands for qualified longevity annuity contract. It's a
deferred annuity
funded with an investment from a
qualified retirement plan
or an
individual retirement account (IRA)
. A QLAC allows funds in a qualified retirement plan, such as a 401(k), a 403(b), or an IRA, to be converted into an annuity.
QLACs are available for purchase through many insurance companies.
A QLAC provides guaranteed monthly payments that begin after the specified annuity starting date. As long as the QLAC complies with
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
requirements, it is exempt from
required minimum distribution (RMD)
rules until the owner reaches age 85.
1
Key Takeaways
A QLAC is a retirement strategy in which a portion of required minimum distributions (RMDs) are deferred.
The SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 allows individuals to move $200,000 from a qualified retirement plan or IRA to a QLAC.
A QLAC allows taxes to be deferred that are normally required by RMDs.
QLACs are available for purchase through many insurance companies.

An annuity is a contract purchased from an insurance company in which the buyer pays a lump sum or a series of premiums. The insurance company pays the
annuitant
beginning on a predetermined start date. How many years the owner receives payments depends on the type of annuity purchased.
The
SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022
allows individuals to move $200,000 to a qualified longevity annuity contract. It adjusts the $200,000 limit annually for inflation, and the legislation removed the rule capping QLAC premiums at 25% of the participant’s total plan assets.
2
A QLAC provides a lifetime income once the preset annuity start date is reached. The longer an individual lives, the longer a QLAC pays out. Using IRA funds to purchase a QLAC helps avoid violating the IRS RMD rules mandating a
minimum amount to be annually withdrawn
from an individual’s retirement account balances beginning at age 73 and increasing to age 75 in 2033.
3
A QLAC allows distributions to be delayed until a predetermined payout date but no later than the person’s 85th birthday. A QLAC also allows a spouse or other party to be a joint annuitant where both named individuals are covered with the same conditions regardless of how long they live.
85
The maximum age to which QLAC funds may be deferred
QLACs and Taxes
QLACs have the added benefit of reducing an individual’s RMDs, which IRAs and qualified retirement plans require. Limiting RMDs can help keep a retiree in a lower tax bracket, with a tax benefit and reduced Medicare premium.
Once QLAC income begins, an individual’s tax liability will increase. The annual distribution is based on the account’s value at the end of the preceding year. The promised benefit of QLACs can only be achieved if rules set by the IRS are followed.
1
QLAC Options
One option to benefit from QLACs is by
laddering
them and purchasing one QLAC each year for several years. Such a strategy is similar to
dollar-cost averaging
, which considers that annuity costs can fluctuate along with interest rates. In other words, a QLAC could be purchased each year, lowering the average cost of the contracts.
All laddered annuity contracts can be structured to begin paying out in the same year. Each contract could also have its payouts staggered to pay out in different years based on the owner’s age and when the income is needed. The first QLAC purchased could begin paying out at age 78, the next at age 79, and continue. However, RMDs are required at age 85.
QLAC buyers can add a cost-of-living adjustment to their contract, which indexes the annuity against inflation. Deciding on this depends on life expectancy, as the cost-of-living adjustment will reduce the QLAC’s initial payout.
Warning
The greatest risk of buying a QLAC is the financial strength of the issuing company.
Example of a QLAC
Shahana is 67 and due to retire in three years. She would like to save on tax liabilities from her RMDs. Based on her current retirement account balances, Shahana’s first-year RMD is estimated at $84,000 when she turns 73.
She has investments in other assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, which should provide her with an income stream during retirement. She also plans to consult part-time to stay current in her field.
Shahana invests $100,000 in a single premium QLAC account from her IRA savings to withdraw when she turns 85. This will delay her RMD withdrawal date for the $100,000 used to purchase the QLAC. When Shahana turns 85, she’ll have guaranteed income from the QLAC for the rest of her life.
The money set aside in the QLAC is excluded from her IRA assets when determining her annual RMDs until she turns 85, resulting in lower current income taxes. However, she will eventually pay income taxes on the distribution amounts from the QLAC and likely a lower tax bracket at age 85.
What Is a Limitation of Purchasing a QLAC?
QLACs are inflexible and may not be suitable for all individuals. Once you purchase a QLAC, you lose access to the money until the annuity begins.
When Do I Pay Taxes on a QLAC?
When your QLAC annuity, your income, begins on the designated date in retirement, the income payments will be taxed at regular income tax rates.
What Is the Cost of a QLAC?
A QLAC requires only the investment from your IRA or qualified retirement account, paid in a lump sum to an insurance company or provider. There are no fees associated with the purchase.
The Bottom Line
A QLAC is a deferred annuity funded from a qualified retirement account, such as an IRA. You can purchase a QLAC from an insurance provider and set a designated date for your payments to begin. IRS rules stipulate that required minimum distributions begin at age 85 from the QLAC. Transferring money to a QLAC reduces a retiree’s annual RMD calculated on other retirement accounts.

Investopedia,"Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA): Definition, Exam","Close
What Is a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA)?
Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) is a professional designation granted by the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association to candidates who have completed Level I and Level II examinations. The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association has established the designation of CAIA to certify that the holders have met the association’s educational standard for specialists in the area of alternative investments.
1
The alternative investments that a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst is trained to assess include
hedge funds
, venture capital,
private equity
, funds of funds,
derivatives
, and real estate investments.
Key Takeaways
Chartered Alternative Investment Analysts are trained to assess alternatives investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, and private equity.
A CAIA designation is also useful for people managing derivatives books or trading desks.
Although the CFA includes alternative investments, the CAIA coverage is more in-depth.
Understanding Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA)
The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst designation is meant for financial professionals who will be working primarily in the alternative investment space. This usually means people working for hedge funds and private equity, although a CAIA designation is also useful to people working for traditional financial institutions in non-traditional roles, like those managing the derivatives book or the trading desk.
Requirements for the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Designation
In order to receive the designation, individuals must meet minimum education and experience requirements and must pass a two-level curriculum that includes topics ranging from qualitative analysis and trading theories of alternative investments to indexation and benchmarking.
2
The Level I exam includes 200 multiple-choice questions on:
Professional Standards and Ethics
Hedge Funds
Introduction to Alternative Investments
Private Equity
Risk Management and Portfolio Management
Structured Products
Real Assets
3
The Level II exam includes 100 multiple-choice questions and three sets of essay questions. Questions are updated each year to reflect industry progress. The questions cover:
Commodities
Professional Ethics and Standards
Private Equity
Asset Allocation and Institutional Investors
Structured Products
Hedge Funds and Managed Futures
Real Assets
4
The exams are administered in March and September, and the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association recommends at least
200 hours of study
.
The cost of enrollment is $400, and Level I and Level II exam registration is $1,250 for each exam.
5
Once certified, there are annual membership dues of $350 for one year or $650 for two years, and a self-evaluation tool to be completed every three years to maintain the designation.
2
Early registrants and members of certain partner organizations may qualify for scholarships or discounts to help defray the cost of enrollment and sitting for the Level I and Level II exams.
Differences Between the CAIA and the CFA
Similar to earning the
Chartered Financial Analyst
(CFA) designation, possessing the CAIA designation provides individuals with access to jobs, member chapters and sources of education. Because the scope of alternative investments is dramatically different from that of conventional investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds, the CAIA designation was created to distinguish those individuals who are best qualified in dealing with this class of investments. The CFA includes content on alternative investments, but the CAIA dives much deeper into the topic and the valuation methods specific to each.
Of the two, the CFA is seen as the more difficult designation to get, as the exams cover more content and have historically had lower pass rates than the CAIA exams. Overall, the CFA is seen as an excellent general designation for the financial industry, but the CAIA can be a difference-maker in niche areas of finance like private equity or hedge funds.

A hedge fund is an actively managed investment that pools money from accredited investors and seeks high returns by using complex strategies and significant risk.
What Is a Hedge Fund?
A hedge fund is an actively managed private investment fund whose money is pooled and managed by professional fund managers. These managers use a wide range of strategies, including
leverage
and the trading of nontraditional assets, to earn above-average investment returns. Investing in hedge funds is often considered a risky alternative investment choice and usually requires a high minimum investment or
net worth
. Hedge funds typically target wealthy investors.
Key Takeaways
Hedge funds are actively managed funds focused on alternative investments that commonly use risky investment strategies.
Investing in a hedge fund is generally open to accredited investors with a high minimum investment or net worth.
Hedge funds charge higher fees than conventional investment funds.
Hedge fund strategies depend on the fund manager and relate to equity, fixed-income, and event-driven investment goals.
A hedge fund investment is usually locked up for a year before shares can be sold.

Understanding Hedge Funds
Hedge funds pool money that is managed to
outperform
average market returns. The fund manager often hedges the fund’s positions to protect them from market risk. This is done by investing some of the assets in securities whose prices move in the opposite direction of the fund’s core holdings. So, if the core holdings' prices drop, the securities' prices should rise. As a result, the hedge can offset any losses in the core holdings.
For example, a hedge fund that focuses on a
cyclical sector
, such as travel, may invest a portion of its assets in a noncyclical sector, such as energy, aiming to use the positive returns of the noncyclical stocks to offset any losses in cyclical stocks.
Hedge funds use risky strategies,
leverage
, and
derivative
securities like options and futures. Therefore, a hedge fund investor is commonly considered an
accredited investor
. This means that they meet a required minimum level of income or assets. Typical investors are institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and wealthy individuals.
Investments in hedge funds are considered
illiquid
as funds often require investors to lock their money in for at least one year—a time known as the lock-up period. Withdrawals may also only happen at certain intervals such as quarterly or biannually.

Types of Hedge Funds
The four common types of hedge funds are:
Global macro hedge funds
: These are actively managed funds that attempt to profit from broad market swings caused by political or economic events.
Equity hedge funds
: These may be global or specific to one country, investing in lucrative stocks while hedging against downturns in
equity markets
by shorting overvalued stocks or stock indices.
Relative value hedge funds
: These funds seek to exploit temporary differences in the prices of related securities, taking advantage of price or spread inefficiencies.
Activist hedge funds
: These aim to invest in businesses and take actions that boost the stock price such as demanding that companies cut costs, restructure assets, or change the
board of directors
.
Fast Fact
The appeal of many hedge funds lies in the reputations of their managers, which stand out in the closed world of hedge fund investing.
Common Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund strategies cover a broad range of risk tolerance and investment philosophies. They involve a large selection of investments, including debt and equity securities, commodities, currencies, derivatives, and
real estate
.
Common
hedge fund strategies
are classified according to the
investment style
of the fund’s manager and include equity, fixed-income, and event-driven investment goals.
A long/short hedge fund strategy is an extension of
pairs trading
, by which investors go long and short on two competing companies in the same industry based on their relative valuations.
A fixed-income hedge fund strategy gives investors solid returns with minimal monthly volatility and aims for capital preservation; it takes both long and short positions in
fixed-income securities
.
An
event-driven
hedge fund strategy takes advantage of temporary stock mispricing, spawned by corporate events like restructurings,
mergers and acquisitions
, bankruptcy, or takeovers.
Examples of Hedge Funds
The most notable hedge funds, based on
assets under management (AUM)
, include:
2
Bridgewater Associates:
Founded in New York in 1975 and headquartered in Westport, Connecticut, with more than $124.32 billion in AUM
Renaissance Technologies:
Founded in 1982 and headquartered in East Setauket, New York, with mathematical- and statistical-based investment strategies, and over $106.03 billion in AUM
AQR Capital Management:
Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, with applied quantitative research investment strategies, and over $94.52 billion in AUM
Hedge Fund Compensation
Australian investor Alfred Winslow Jones is credited with launching the first hedge fund in 1949 through his company, A.W. Jones & Co. Raising $100,000, he designed a fund that aimed to minimize the risk in long-term stock investing by
short selling
, now referred to as the long/short equities model.
In 1952, Jones converted his fund to a
limited partnership
, added a 20% incentive fee as compensation for the managing partner, and became the first money manager to combine short selling,
the use of leverage
, and a compensation system based on performance.
3
Today, hedge funds employ a standard “2 and 20” fee system, which refers to a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee:
1
The management fee is based on the net asset value of each investor’s shares, so an investment of $1 million garners a $20,000 management fee that year to cover the operations of the hedge and
compensate the fund manager
.
The performance fee is commonly 20% of profits. If an investment of $1 million increases to $1.2 million in one year, $40,000 is the fee owed to the fund.
Hedge Funds vs. Mutual Funds
Hedge funds are not as strictly regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
as mutual funds are.
4
Hedge Funds
A hedge fund can invest in land, real estate, stocks, derivatives, and
currencies
. It is normally only open to accredited investors or those with an annual income that exceeds $200,000 or a net worth exceeding $1 million. These investors are considered suitable to handle the potential risks that hedge funds are permitted to take.
5
Hedge funds typically limit opportunities to
redeem shares
and often impose a locked period of one year before shares can be cashed in. They typically employ the 2% management fee and 20% performance fee structure.
Mutual Funds
Mutual funds
use stocks or bonds as their instruments for long-term investment strategies. They are a practical, cost-efficient way to build a
diversified portfolio
of stocks, bonds, or short-term investments. They are available to the general public and the average investor.
Unlike hedge funds, mutual fund investors can sell their shares at any time. The average expense ratio for equity mutual funds was 0.40% in 2024.

What to Consider Before Investing
As investors research hedge funds that meet their investment goals, they often consider the fund or firm’s size, the track record and longevity of the fund, the minimum investment required to participate, and the redemption terms of the fund. Hedge funds operate in many countries, including the U.S., the
United Kingdom
, Hong Kong, Canada, and France.

What Is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)?
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) refers to a group of 12 of the world’s major oil-exporting nations. OPEC was founded in 1960 to coordinate the
petroleum
policies of its members and to provide member states with technical and economic aid.
1
OPEC is a
cartel
that aims to manage the supply of oil in
an effort to set the price of oil on the world market
and avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.
2
Countries that belong to OPEC include Algeria, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.

Key Takeaways
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is a cartel consisting of 12 of the world’s major oil-exporting nations.
OPEC aims to regulate the supply of oil in order to set the price on the world market.
The arrival of fracking technology for natural gas in the U.S. has reduced OPEC’s ability to control the world market.
The organization was established in 1960 by its founding members Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.
While OPEC does ensure that there is a steady supply of oil in the global market, it has come under fire for holding considerable power in the industry, which allows it to keep prices as high as possible.
1
Understanding the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) describes itself as a permanent intergovernmental organization. The organization is designed to ""coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its Member Countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets."" This ensures that there is a steady supply for consumers and regular income for petroleum producers.
2
It is headquartered in Vienna, Austria, where the OPEC secretariat, its executive organ, carries out day-to-day business.
4
OPEC was established in Baghdad in September 1960 by founding members Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, and now consists of 12 member countries.

The
chief executive officer (CEO)
of OPEC is its secretary-general.

Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo of Nigeria was appointed to the position for a three-year term of office on June 2, 2016, and was re-elected to another three-year term in July 2019.
7
8
Important
Some of the world’s greatest oil-producing countries, such as Russia, China, and the U.S., do not belong to OPEC. This leaves them free to pursue their own objectives.
History of OPEC
As noted above, OPEC was founded in Baghdad in 1960. Five countries took part in the Baghdad Conference between September 10 and 14 that year: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. The organization established its Secretariat in Geneva before finalizing its location in Vienna in 1965. Three years later, OPEC adopted its declaratory statement on petroleum policy.
1
OPEC's membership expanded to 10 countries in 1969. As an organization, it flew under the radar until Arab member countries cut production and banned exports to the United States and the Netherlands. The
embargo
was a response to the West's support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973. A year later, oil prices shot up, causing shortages in the U.S. The embargo was lifted in 1974.
9
By 1975, OPEC had 13 member countries.
1
In 1976, OPEC established the OPEC Fund for International Development. Member countries work with developing nations and the international community to provide private and trade sector financing and grants to non-member countries.
10
OPEC Member Countries
According to its statutes,
OPEC
membership is open to any country that is a substantial exporter of oil and shares the ideals of the organization. In addition to its five founding members, OPEC consists of seven additional members:
Algeria
Congo
Equatorial Guinea
Gabon
Libya
Nigeria
United Arab Emirates
3
As of 2024, the organization consists of 12 member countries.
3
OPEC Mission
According to OPEC's website, the group's mission is “to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its Member Countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic, and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on
capital
for those investing in the petroleum industry.”
2
The organization is committed to finding ways to ensure that
oil prices are stabilized
in the international market without any major fluctuations. Doing this helps keep the interests of member nations while ensuring they receive a regular stream of income from an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to other countries.
11
OPEC recognizes the founding nations as full members. Any country that wishes to join and whose application is accepted by the organization is also considered a full member. These countries must have significant crude petroleum exports. Membership to OPEC is only granted after receiving a vote from at least three-quarters of its full members. Associate memberships are also granted to countries under special conditions.

How OPEC Influences Oil Prices
Collectively, OPEC is the largest producer and exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in the world. Having said this, it's no surprise that any moves the group makes have a big impact on global energy prices. Oil prices can drop significantly if they decide to supply more oil to the market. On the other hand, if OPEC member countries decide to cut production and curb supplies, prices are highly likely to shoot up.
Advantages and Disadvantages of OPEC
Advantages
There are several advantages of having a cartel like OPEC operating in the crude oil industry. First, it promotes cooperation among member nations, helping them alleviate some degree of political hostilities. And because the organization's main goal is to stabilize oil production and prices, it is able to exert some influence over production from other nations.
Disadvantages
OPEC’s influence on the market has been widely criticized. Because its member countries hold the vast majority of crude
oil reserves
, the organization has considerable power in these markets.
13
As a cartel, OPEC members have a strong incentive to keep oil prices as high as possible while maintaining their shares of the global market.
Pros
Promotes cooperation among member nations
Exerts influence over production from other nations
Cons
Has considerable power
Incentivized to keep oil prices high to maintain global market share
OPEC Challenges and Responses
Oil prices and OPEC's role in the international petroleum market are subject to a number of different factors. The advent of new technology, especially
fracking
in the United States, has had a major effect on worldwide oil prices and
has lessened OPEC’s influence on the markets
. As a result, worldwide oil production increased and prices dropped significantly, leaving OPEC in a delicate position.
OPEC decided to maintain high production levels and consequently low prices as of mid-2016, in an attempt to push higher-cost producers out of the market and
regain market share
. However, starting in January 2019, OPEC reduced output by 1.2 million barrels a day for six months due to a concern that an economic slowdown would create a supply glut, extending the agreement for an additional nine months in July 2019.
14
Demand for oil dropped during the global crisis
, which began in 2020. Producers had an overabundance in supply with no place to store it, as the world experienced lockdowns cutting down demand. This, along with a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, led to a drop in oil prices. As a result, the organization decided to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day between May and July 2020.
15
Oil prices continued to experience volatility, leading OPEC to adjust production levels to 7.2 million barrels per day as of January 2021.
16
OPEC faces considerable challenges from innovation and new, green technology. High oil prices are causing some oil-importing countries to look to unconventional—and cleaner—sources of energy. These alternatives, such as shale production as an alternative energy source, and hybrid and electric cars that reduce the dependence on petroleum products, continue to put pressure on the organization.

What Is a Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) Plan?
A voluntary employees’ beneficiary association (VEBA) plan is a tax-exempt trust set up by employers or a group of employees to cover the eligible
medical expenses
of its members, their dependents, or designated beneficiaries. These plans are typically funded by the employer and are governed under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9).
Employee contributions may or may not be mandatory depending on the company plan, although individual elections are not permitted. However, employees must be covered by an employer-sponsored health plan to be eligible for VEBA membership. Additionally, the company must observe rules established by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
for creating and maintaining a VEBA.
Key Takeaways
A voluntary employees’ beneficiary association (VEBA) plan is a tax-exempt trust typically funded by an employer to help employees pay for eligible medical expenses.
This type of employee benefit program has waned in popularity over the years, though some employers still offer them.
VEBA rules state that employers must first obtain a letter of determination from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for their plan to be considered a VEBA for federal income tax purposes.
VEBAs are subject to some aspects of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); however, they are not considered to be qualified retirement plans.
How a VEBA Plan Works
VEBAs allow employers to provide benefits to employees on the condition that they abide by the following requirements:
1
Be a voluntary association of employees
Provide for payment of life, sick, accident, or other similar benefits to members or their dependents or designated beneficiaries
Earnings must be used solely for the administration and payment of participant benefits and not line the pockets of private individuals or shareholders.
2
VEBAs can cover a wide range of benefits. Eligible medical expenses are determined by the IRS, and each plan can vary in what it covers from this list and when payouts are made.
VEBAs are subject to some aspects of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
; however, they are not considered to be qualified retirement plans.
1
As mentioned above, beneficiaries must be employees, their dependents, or their designated beneficiaries.
3
Also, VEBA benefits normally end when the employee leaves the company or labor union with which the VEBA is associated.
4
Warning
Not every VEBA plan is the same. Some may be available for current eligible expenses. Others, meanwhile, may only reimburse vision and dental costs or just cover medical costs incurred after you leave the job or retire.
Taxation of VEBA Plans
VEBA rules state that employers must first obtain a letter of determination from the IRS for their plan to be considered a VEBA for federal income tax purposes.
5
These plans are considered to be welfare benefit plans under federal tax law and are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(9) of the
Internal Revenue Code
.
6
Employer contributions made to a VEBA plan are tax deductible and have no limit. However, benefits paid out to employees may, or may not, be taxable, depending on the type of benefit.
6
Important
Unlike in 401(k) or 403(b) plans, for example, participant withdrawals from a VEBA are not taxable if made before age 59½. Withdrawals from a VEBA are not required to begin at age 72.
Cashing Out of a VEBA
Funds in a VEBA grow tax-free, and there are no tax penalties levied upon employees or VEBA members who take distributions from a VEBA for qualified medical expenses, which often include co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles, as well as dental and vision payments. These expenses are defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.
7
Members can also use VEBA plans to fund post-retirement health insurance premiums.
Even though these accounts are usually used as savings vehicles to fund healthcare expenses in retirement, employees can use money from their VEBAs to pay for qualified medical expenses while working. If account holders don’t use money in their VEBA plans for a given year, then that amount rolls over to the next year’s balance. This means that a VEBA is not a use-it-or-lose-it plan, unlike a
Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
.
Tip
A VEBA is not a use-it-or-lose-it plan. If account holders don’t use money in their plans for a given year, then that amount rolls over to the next year’s balance.
Types of VEBA Plans
A VEBA plan can also act as a type of
health reimbursement arrangement (HRA)
.
A post-deductible VEBA plan, for example, is designed to reimburse vision and dental expenses until a member meets their health plan deductible. After the deductible is met, members can be reimbursed for non-health plan-related medical expenses.
A limited VEBA plan, however, can reimburse only medical and vision expenses. Meanwhile, money in a post-employment VEBA plan can be used only after an individual has retired or left employment with the VEBA’s sponsor.
When a VEBA plan is paired with a
Health Savings Account (HSA)
, VEBA dollars will be limited toward eligible dental and vision expenses until individuals meet their medical health plan deductibles.
Who Is Eligible for a VEBA?
To be eligible for a VEBA plan, your employer must offer one. Also, you must be an active employee and be covered by your employer’s health insurance plan.
Is a VEBA an HRA?
Health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) allow employers to reimburse employees for certain medical expenses. Employees can roll over contributions year to year while investing contributions for growth. Under that definition, a VEBA can be considered a type of HRA.
What Is the Difference Between a VEBA and an HSA?
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) allow you to save for qualified medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis. These accounts are associated with high-deductible health plans. The main difference between a VEBA and an HSA is how they’re funded. VEBAs are funded only by the employer in most cases, while HSAs can be funded with employer and employee contributions.
Can I Have a VEBA and an HSA?
Yes, depending on the options offered by your employer, it is possible to have both a VEBA and an HSA. If you have both, it’s important to understand the rules for contributions, withdrawals, and taxation to ensure that you’re making the most of these benefits.
The Bottom Line
A VEBA plan is a trust fund governed under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9) that helps employees cover the cost of certain medical expenses, insurance premiums, health insurance deductibles, and so on. These plans can be very advantageous, offering tax benefits and security for workers, and, despite waning in popularity, there are companies that continue to offer them.

Investopedia,"Quarter on Quarter (QOQ): Definition, How to Calculate, and Example","Close
What Is Quarter on Quarter (QOQ)?
Quarter on quarter (QOQ) is a measuring technique that calculates the change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. The term is similar to the
year-over-year (YOY)
measure, which compares the quarter of one year (such as the first quarter of 2024) to the same quarter of the previous year (the first quarter of 2023).
The measure gives investors and analysts an idea of how a company is growing over each
quarter
.
Key Takeaways
Quarter on quarter (QOQ) compares a change in performance between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter.
QOQ reflects short-term changes in various
metrics
and can indicate company performance over two quarters.
Businesses that have income fluctuations or peak earnings at certain times may need to make seasonal adjustments or use a YOY metric to measure performance.
Understanding Quarter on Quarter (QQQ)
QOQ allows a business to monitor shorter-term changes and to progress toward goals or benchmarks set for the year. It can provide valuable information as to how a
company
is performing and allow the company to respond and make process changes if required.
Often, the QOQ measure is used to compare
earnings
between quarters. For example, Company ABC’s first-quarter earnings were $1.50 per share, and its second-quarter earnings were $1.75 per share. By calculating the QOQ growth between quarters ($1.75 - $1.50/$1.50), it’s clear that the company has grown its earnings by 16.6%, which is a positive indicator for
investors
.
Quarter on Quarter in Practice
When used in financial or accounting principles, a quarter is a consecutive three-month period within the year. Traditionally, the first quarter (Q1) refers to January, February, and March. Each subsequent three-month period represents Q2, Q3, and Q4.
When used as part of a QOQ analysis, a business would compare
financials
from Q2 (April, May, June) to Q1 (January, February, March). This comparison varies from YOY, where the same quarter is compared from one year to the next. For example, Q1 of 2024 is compared to Q1 of 2023 in a YOY review.
Important
Comparing quarters on a year-over-year (YOY) basis can be more effective than on a quarter-on-quarter (QOQ) basis, as it gives a broader picture of company health and is not impacted by seasonal issues.
Challenges With QOQ Analysis
There are circumstances where QOQ analysis may not provide a holistic view of the health of an organization. For example, if an industry experiences
seasonal sales variance
, such as landscapers or seasonal sellers, what may appear to be a downward trend may be an industry norm.
The same can apply if a business experiences higher earnings during a peak season that may reflect abnormally high growth from one quarter to the next. An organization may choose to adjust the figures seasonally and compensate for regular shifts in business, giving a more accurate picture throughout the year. Since YOY analysis involves the examination of the same quarter from one year to the next, it does not typically require a seasonal adjustment to provide valuable data.
Real-World Example
A company’s earnings report from one quarter to the next can affect the market. A disappointing earnings report can cause the stock to plunge as investors try to sell off the stock before the price drops.
In 2018,
Amazon
’s third-quarter earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates, but Amazon’s guidance for the fourth quarter fell short of expectations, and the company’s stock price plunged in response to the announcement. The last quarter of the year includes the holidays and is typically Amazon’s busiest season. Fourth-quarter
revenue
guidance was significantly below the consensus and caused concern among shareholders. Amazon stock plunged by 10%, although it eventually recovered as investors priced in the news.
1
How Does Quarter on Quarter (QOQ) Work?
Quarter on quarter (QOQ) compares performance change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. It reflects short-term changes in various metrics and can indicate company performance over two quarters.
How Does QOQ Benefit a Business?
QOQ lets a company monitor shorter-term changes and progress toward goals or benchmarks set for the year. The measure can provide valuable information on a business’s performance and allow the business to respond and make process changes if it has to.
Where Is QOQ Less Effective?
An industry that experiences seasonal sales variance may not get an accurate picture of their well-being from QOQ analysis. A downward trend may be an industry norm. The same goes for a business that experiences higher earnings during a peak season that may reflect abnormally high growth from one quarter to the next.
The Bottom Line
Quarter on quarter (QOQ) calculates the change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. The measuring technique gives investors and analysts an idea of how a company is growing over each quarter.

Investopedia,"Zoning Ordinance: Definition, Types of Regulations, Pros and Cons","Close
What Is a Zoning Ordinance?
A zoning ordinance is a rule that defines how property in specific geographic zones can be used.
Zoning
ordinances detail whether specific geographic zones are acceptable for residential or commercial purposes. Zoning ordinances may also regulate lot size, placement, density, architectural style, and the height of structures. Zoning ordinances also describe the procedures for how to handle any zoning rule infractions (including any penalties).
Key Takeaways
A zoning ordinance is a rule that defines how property in specific geographic zones can be used.
Zoning ordinances may also regulate lot size, placement, density, and the height of structures.
Zoning rules vary greatly by region, but their most general, shared purpose is to separate residential property use from commercial property use.
Zoning Types
The main types of zoning are industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural. Other types of zoning used in some municipalities include historic, school, hospital, and airport zoning. Within the main categories, there are usually designations for density of units. For example, in some areas, residential zoning includes designations like R-2 for up to two residential units per acre or R-4 for up to four residential units per acre. Designations like R-2 and R-4 mean very different things depending on the municipality, so check with your local zoning office to see what it means in yours.
How a Zoning Ordinance Works
The process of zoning consists of dividing a particular region of land into districts or zones, then specifying the types of land uses that are allowed or prohibited for each zone. This is generally performed by a municipal corporation or county. Zoning rules vary greatly by region, but their most general, shared purpose is to separate residential property use from
commercial property
use.
Municipal governments can institute highly specific zoning ordinances to influence the nature of a district or neighborhood in its municipality. For example, by designating several neighboring sections of a city strictly for residential use, residents of that region will experience less traffic and noise pollution in their environment. Zoning ordinances are also used to preserve the architectural integrity of the buildings in a specific area. If a municipality wishes to maintain the historic appearance of a part of town, zoning ordinances can be used to limit real estate construction there so that all new buildings must be of comparable height and square footage with the historic buildings.
Important
Zoning designations vary wildly by state, county, and municipality. If you are confused about zoning laws in your area, the first step is to check with your county’s or municipality’s zoning office, sometimes referred to as your land use office. You may need to consult with a local
real estate attorney
if you have an issue with zoning.
Exceptions to Zoning Laws
Changes to zoning ordinances can create tension among current and prospective residents and landlords of property in the zoned region. For example, this may be the case if a new business plans to move to a specific city, only to discover that the zoning rules have changed in the geographic region of the property that they intended to occupy.
Grandfather Clause
As a result of new zoning ordinances, commercial properties may be forced to switch to residential properties and vice versa. In some instances, existing tenants may be forced to relocate because of these changes. However, zoning ordinances sometimes contain
legacy clauses
, also referred to as grandfather clauses. Legacy clauses exempt existing tenants from being impacted by any changes to the current zoning rules, provided that they were already residing in the zone by a specified date. This process of being exempt from new rules and regulations is also referred to as being “grandfathered in.”
Certain exceptions allow properties that do not meet the requirements of a zoning ordinance to still be established in those respective geographic zones. If an ordinance changes a zone that once allowed commercial businesses to operate to a residential-only zone, then some small, local businesses may be allowed to stay open because of a legacy clause.
Zoning Variance
New businesses also have the option of applying for a variance. A variance is a request to deviate from current zoning rules. If the variance is approved, the new tenant can move in and operate regardless of the zoning ordinance.
What are the disadvantages of zoning?
Traditional applications of zoning ordinances geographically separate residential neighborhoods from where people work, shop, and play, making residents dependent on cars. Those who would like to move away from the high economic and environmental costs of transportation advocate for integrated, walkable neighborhoods with less rigid zoning ordinances.
What are the advantages of zoning?
When done properly, zoning allows cities to grow sustainably for generations. By setting aside areas near schools or airports or hospitals for future expansion, cities are able to build their communities responsibly.
Do zoning regulations contribute to the housing crisis?
Low-density residential zoning regulations have contributed to the housing crisis in areas with limited opportunities for expansion. Formerly small cities that have exploded in population, like Palo Alto, Calif., are full of areas zoned for low density. If they stay low density, then their housing crisis will continue to worsen. However, locals in these low-density areas usually strongly oppose any proposals to build more dense neighborhoods.
1
The Bottom Line
Zoning ordinances exist to help cities keep their character as they grow. They prevent a factory from being built in your backyard or a residential high rise from being built miles away from any transportation hubs or roads built for high capacity. As populations rise globally, particularly in urban areas, cities will need to adjust some residential ordinances to allow for higher-density housing.

What Is Leadership?
Business leadership is the capacity of a company's management to set and achieve challenging goals. They must take fast and decisive action when necessary, outperform the competition, and inspire others to perform at the highest level possible.
It can be difficult to place a value on leadership or other qualitative aspects of a company, unlike quantitative management
metrics
that are commonly tracked and much easier to compare between companies. Leadership can also speak to a more holistic approach, such as the tone a company's management sets or the culture of the company that management establishes.
Key Takeaways
Leadership is setting and achieving goals, tackling the competition, and solving problems decisively and quickly.
Leadership also refers to the tone a company's management sets in terms of the corporate culture.
Some people with strong leadership skills in the business world rise to become the CEO, COO, CFO, president, or chair of their companies.
Productive leadership shows optimism and provides positive energy for staff.
Understanding Leadership
Leadership
provides direction for a company and its workers. Employees must know the direction in which the company is headed and who to follow to reach the destination. Leadership involves showing workers how to effectively perform their responsibilities and regularly supervising the completion of their tasks.
Leadership is also about setting a positive example for staff to follow, being excited about the work, being motivated to learn new things, and helping out as needed in both individual and team activities.
Important
Leadership involves setting and achieving goals, taking action, and beating the competition, but it also relates to the tone of the company's management and the kind of culture built for the employees.
The Components of Effective Leadership
Effective leadership requires a strong character. Leaders should exhibit honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and ethics. They act in line with how they speak and earn the right to be responsible for others' success in the company.
Strong leadership involves clear communication skills. Leaders speak with and listen to staff members, respond to questions and concerns, and are empathetic. They use their communication skills to move the company forward and achieve new levels of success.
True leadership sees where the company is headed and plans the steps necessary to get there. Leaders must visualize what's possible, follow industry trends, and take calculated risks to grow the business.
Productive leadership shows optimism and provides positive energy for staff. Good leaders are supportive and truly concerned about the well-being of others. Leaders find answers to challenges, and they reassure and inspire workers when things go awry. Leaders find ways for staff to work together and achieve maximum results efficiently and effectively.
An Example of Leadership
Jack Welch was the chief executive officer (CEO) of General Electric Co. from 1981 to 2001. He played an integral part in hundreds of acquisitions in emerging markets and increased GE’s market value from $12 billion to $410 billion at the time of his retirement.
1
Welch insisted everyone at GE embrace change because the world is constantly changing. Managers and employees had to continuously reinvent themselves and their work to continue evolving company operations and produce greater output.
Welch hired managers who shared his vision of GE, had endless amounts of energy, and were able to encourage employees to stay engaged in their work. He sought managers who created, developed, and refined ideas for the future and found ways to make them a reality. He also insisted that managers work side-by-side with employees as a way of understanding what they were doing and why.
Managers and employees were more empowered as a result of Welch’s
leadership style
. Products gained higher quality, customer satisfaction, and profits increased dramatically.
What Is the Best Definition of Leadership?
Leadership is the ability to motivate others and listen to them, be trustworthy and competent. They must be decisive, have good communication skills, and selflessly understand the goals of the team or organization.
What Defines a Good Leader?
Good leaders are most importantly listeners, visionaries, and decision-makers. The best are humble and fully invested in their followers and business.
What Are 7 Leadership Qualities of Great Leaders?
Great leaders demonstrate decisiveness, courage, integrity, dependability, tact, loyalty, and enthusiasm, among many other qualities. Great leaders inspire others to do difficult or seemingly impossible tasks.
The Bottom Line
Leadership is as much an art as it is a matter of ability. It’s about using your skills, knowledge, abilities, and humanity to guide and encourage others to accomplish organizational goals and professional achievements.

Investopedia,"What Is Personal Finance, and Why Is It Important?","Close
Definition
Personal finance is the practice of managing your money as well as saving and investing.
What Is Personal Finance?
Personal finance is the term used to describe all aspects of an individual's money management, including saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them on financial and investment opportunities.
Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it's essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.
Key Takeaways
Few schools have courses on managing your money, so it is important to learn how through free online articles, courses, blogs, podcasts, or books.
The core areas of managing personal finance include income, spending, savings, investments, and protection.
Smart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and much more.
Being disciplined is important, but it's also good to know when you shouldn't adhere to the guidelines.
The Importance of Personal Finance
Personal finance
is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and financial protections (insurance and estate planning).
Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In Q3 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.8 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the second quarter of 2024 to the third:
1
Credit card debt
: Up by $24 billion
Auto debt
: Up by $18 billion
Student debt
: Up by $21 billion
Mortgage debt
: Up by $75 billion
Home equity line of credit
: Up by $7 billion
Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.
Areas of Personal Finance
The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.
Income
Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.
Spending
Spending is an outflow of cash and is typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever you use your income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.
Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. You should ensure your spending is less than your income; otherwise, you won't have enough money to cover your expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high interest rates credit cards charge.
Saving
Savings are the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have some savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.
Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.
Investing
Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.
Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through reading and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.
Protection
Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.
Personal Finance Services
Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:
Wealth management
Loans and debt
Budgeting
Retirement
Taxes
Risk management
Estate planning
Investments
Insurance
Credit cards
Home and mortgage
Personal Finance Strategies
The sooner you start
financial planning
, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are some best practices and tips for personal finance.
Fast Fact
The
2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey
surveyed 4,000 adults and found that the majority of participants were concerned about personal finance basics, retirement funding, and investing in crypto.
1. Know Your Income
It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So, before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.
2. Devise a Budget
A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:
Fifty percent of your take-home pay or net income (after taxes) goes toward living essentials, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transport.
Thirty percent is allocated to discretionary expenses, such as dining out and shopping for clothes. Giving to charity can go here as well.
Twenty percent goes toward the future, such as paying down debt, saving for retirement, and emergencies.
It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:
YNAB (You Need a Budget)
helps you track and adjust your spending to control every dollar you spend.
PocketGuard is available in both free and paid versions. It uses an algorithm to help you avoid overspending by analyzing your income, bills, goals, and budget.
3. Pay Yourself First
It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.
Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on
a home
.
4. Limit and Reduce Debt
It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset.
Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing can sometimes be more economical than buying outright, whether it's renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.
On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you're young: This is also one of the best times for your nest egg to get the maximum benefit from
compounding interest
. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in autopay.
2
Student loans account for $1.61 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it. There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you're stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.
1
Flexible federal repayment programs
worth checking out include:
3
Graduated repayment—progressively increases the monthly payment over 10 years
Extended repayment—stretches out the loan over a period that can be as long as 25 years
Income-driven repayment—limits payments to 10% to 20% of your income (based on your income and family size)
5. Only Borrow What You Can Repay
Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.
Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).
4
Given the extraordinary rewards and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.
Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp

Definition
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is a company’s operating profit without interest expenses and income taxes.
Company financial statements often contain a mix of accounting adjustments, one-time events, and complex tax situations that could obscure the performance of a business's core operations. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) can help cut through any confusion by focusing on what truly matters: the profit a company generates from its main business activities.
""EBIT is central to operational profitability,"" said Olayemi Dada, an audit manager at KPMG U.S. ""It removes the effects of financing and taxes, and then you can see a company's core profitability.""
For example, when comparing two retail chains—one with heavy debt and one debt-free—EBIT allows investors to assess their operational performance without all other items that affects a balance sheet. As such, investors and analysts rely on EBIT to make apples-to-apples comparisons between companies with different financial structures, identify concerning operational trends, and assess a company's ability to cover its debts. In this article, we'll explain what EBIT means, show you how to calculate it, highlight its importance in financial analysis, and distinguish it from similar metrics like EBITDA.
Key Takeaways
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) measures a company's operational profitability by removing the effects of financing decisions and tax environments from the equation.
Unlike net income, EBIT allows investors to compare companies with different debt levels and tax situations fairly, focusing solely on operations.
EBIT differs from EBITDA in that it includes depreciation and amortization expenses, making it a more conservative measure of operational performance.
While EBIT provides valuable insights, it ignores capital spending needs and could mask some cash flow issues.
Investopedia / Daniel Fishel
What Is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)?
EBIT is a straightforward measure of how much profit a company makes from its day-to-day operations, without factoring in interest payments on debt or income taxes. It shows how much profit a company makes from its operations alone.
EBIT helps answer a basic question that all potential investors have: ""How much money does this business make from its actual business activities?"" For example, if you run a doughnut shop, your EBIT would show the profit from selling doughnuts and coffee, regardless of how you financed your kitchen oven or what you owe the IRS.

EBIT appears on company income statements, though it's often labeled as ""operating profit"" or ""
operating income
."" Some companies may include nonoperating income in EBIT calculations, particularly if those activities are regular parts of their business model.
One key point: EBIT isn't an official accounting term defined by generally accepted accounting principles. This means companies have some flexibility in how they report it, which is why many analysts and investors calculate it themselves using information from standardized financial statements.
1
Tip
Many investors might misinterpret a company's profitability by focusing solely on
net income
, but EBIT reveals whether a company's fundamental business model works before financing costs come into play.
Importance of EBIT
EBIT has earned its place as a fundamental financial metric because it reveals a company's operational strength without the distractions of financing decisions or tax situations. Here's what it's often used for:
Operational profitability
: EBIT strips away interest and tax expenses to reveal how efficiently a company runs its core business. For example, if a business generates $1M in revenue and incurs $750K in operating costs, its EBIT of $250K reflects profit solely from core operations—before interest and taxes affect the bottom line.
2
Performance benchmarking
: Managers can track EBIT to measure operational performance against industry peers and historical trends. A manufacturing plant manager might target year-over-year EBIT growth of 5% through process improvements, even while major capital investments temporarily cut net income.
Apples-to-apples comparisons
: EBIT creates a level playing field for comparing companies with different capital structures or tax situations. Two restaurants might both generate an EBIT of $500,000, indicating similar operational efficiency, even if one carries heavy debt while the other is debt-free. This allows investors to identify which business fundamentally operates better rather than which one simply has less debt or smarter tax planning.
Identifying trends and areas for improvement
: If a company's EBIT steadily declines over several quarters while revenue remains steady, it could indicate rising operating costs or that competition is building, which would warrant further investigation.
Assessing debt coverage
: Lenders and analysts use EBIT to determine if a company generates enough operational profit to cover its interest obligations. The
interest coverage ratio
(EBIT ÷ Interest Expense) shows if a business can comfortably meet its debt obligations. A coverage ratio below 1.5 might signal danger, while a ratio above 3.0 typically indicates financial stability.
Valuing a potential acquisition
: When valuing potential acquisitions, buyers often focus on EBIT because it shows what the business would earn with its financial structure.
Formula and Calculation
The EBIT formula is straightforward but powerful, allowing investors to quickly assess a company's core operational strength. There are two common ways to calculate EBIT:
Formula 1: Starting from the top of the income statement
EBIT = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (
COGS
) - Operating Expenses
Formula 2: Starting from the bottom and working backward
EBIT =
Net Income
+ Interest Expenses + Tax Expenses
Let's break down each component:
Revenue
: This is all the money a company brings in from selling its products or services before any expenses are subtracted. For a retail store, this would be the total register receipts; for a subscription service, the total fees collected from subscribers.
COGS
: These are the direct costs of producing the goods or services a company sells. This includes raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. For a car manufacturer, COGS would include steel, rubber, workers' wages, and factory electricity.
Operating expenses
: These are the day-to-day costs of running the business that aren't directly tied to production. Think office rent, administrative salaries, marketing costs, and research and development expenses.
3
To see how this works in real life, consider a hypothetical company, BrightTech Solutions, a mid-sized technology company that designs and sells smart home devices, including AI-powered thermostats and security cameras. BrightTech generates revenue primarily through direct online sales, partnerships with major retailers, and subscription services for advanced device features.
In the past year, BrightTech earned $1 million in revenue from product sales and service subscriptions. However, producing these smart home devices involved significant costs, with $600,000 spent on raw materials, manufacturing, and logistics—classified as COGS. In addition, the company had $200,000 in operating expenses to cover marketing, salaries, office rent, and customer support.
To determine BrightTech’s Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT):
EBIT = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses
EBIT = 1,000,000 - 600,000 - 200,000 = 200,000.
This means BrightTech’s core operations generated $200,000 in profit before considering interest expenses on any loans or tax obligations.
EBIT vs. EBITDA
EBIT and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) are both used to evaluate a company's profitability but differ in their calculations and uses.
3
Unlike EBIT, EBITDA adds back depreciation and amortization. This adjustment often provides a clearer view of the operational cash flow, which is especially useful in capital-intensive industries where these noncash expenses can be significant.
Keep in mind that while EBITDA can highlight cash-generating potential, it doesn’t account for the cap",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp
Investopedia,"Joint and Several Liability: Definition, Example, State Limits","Close
Joint and several liability is a legal term for a responsibility shared by two or more parties to a lawsuit. A wronged party may sue any or all of them, as well as collect the total damages awarded by a court from any or all of them.
In such cases, responsibility for the total amount awarded would be shared by all. Failure by any of the parties to pay would increase the obligation of the others.
Key Takeaways
In law, joint and several liability makes all parties in a suit responsible for damages up to the entire amount awarded.
That is, if one party is unable to pay, the others named must pay more than their share.
In a contract, “jointly and severally liable” means the same thing as “joint and several liability.”
More commonly, comparative fault laws limit an individual’s payment to a proportion based on the extent of their fault.
How Does Joint and Several Liability Work?
Joint and several
liability
favors the plaintiff suing for damages because it empowers them to pursue full payment, if necessary, from the party with the deepest pockets if the others named cannot pay.
If all of the parties involved are
insolvent
and uninsured, then the plaintiff collects nothing.
Joint and several liability differs in law from
comparative fault
, in which multiple parties are assigned responsibility for a portion of the damages in relation to the degree of fault that they bear for the harm. In such cases, a plaintiff may be left in the position of seeking damages from the party that is least able to pay.
Comparative fault is sometimes called “pure several liability.” It is more common in the United States than joint and several liability.
Most U.S. states have limited the use of joint and several liability or have developed a hybrid approach. For example, a state might allow joint and several liability to apply only to parties who are found responsible for more than 50% of the damage done.
The hybrid approach was adopted as a means of reforming a system that appeared to encourage some plaintiffs to add a single party with deep pockets, such as a large
corporation
, to a suit to get an outsized award.
Criticism of Joint and Several Liability
As noted, joint and several liability tends to benefit the plaintiff, as it increases the chances that all of the damages awarded can be collected.
Important
Most states in the U.S. limit the use of joint and several responsibility or employ a hybrid approach.
On the other hand, it may be considered unfair to a party who bears only a minor responsibility for an adverse event to bear an outsized financial loss because of it.
Example of a Joint and Several Liability Suit
A joint and several liability case could be launched on behalf of workers who became ill after working at multiple job sites where they were exposed to harmful materials. For example, they might be construction workers who suffer physical ailments that can be attributed to contact with a toxic substance that was present in materials used in all of their workplaces.
The workers might argue that inadequate precautions were taken by several employers who were responsible for worker safety at various sites where they worked.
What does it mean to be jointly and severally liable?
Joint and several liability makes all parties in a lawsuit responsible for damages up to the entire amount awarded. That is, if one party is unable to pay, then the others named must pay more than their share.
What is several but not joint liability?
Several liability (or proportionate liability) is when all parties are liable for just their own respective obligations. In effect, it is the opposite of
joint liability
.
What is the purpose of joint and several liability?
Joint and several liability is a way to reduce the risk of financial loss to one party to a contract. It allows a plaintiff suing for damages to pursue full payment, if necessary, from the party with the deepest pockets if the others named cannot pay.
The Bottom Line
In law, joint and several liability makes all parties in a lawsuit responsible for damages up to the entire amount awarded. That is, if one party is unable to pay, then the others named must pay more than their share until their joint financial obligation has been met.

Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount and they repay the par value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value is the investor's return.
What Is a Zero-Coupon Bond?
A zero-coupon bond is an investment in debt that doesn't pay interest. It instead trades at a deep discount. The profit is realized at its maturity date when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.
A zero-coupon bond is also known as an accrual bond.
Key Takeaways
A zero-coupon bond doesn't pay interest to the holder.
Zero-coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount to face value but they're repaid at full face value or par at maturity.
The difference between the purchase price of a zero-coupon bond and its par value is the investor's return.
They can be subject to interest rate risk if investors sell them before maturity.
Investopedia / Laura Porter
The Basics of Zero-Coupon Bonds
Some bonds are issued as zero-coupon instruments. Others are transformed into zero-coupon instruments after a financial institution strips them of their coupons and repackages them as zero-coupon bonds.
They offer payment at face value at maturity so zero-coupon bonds tend to fluctuate in price on the secondary market much more than
coupon bonds
.
1
What Is a Bond?
A bond is a tool for a company or a government to borrow money. Investors who purchase bonds are effectively acting as lenders to the issuing entity. The investors earn a return in the form of
coupon payments
that are made semiannually or annually throughout the life of the bond.

The bondholder is repaid an amount equal to the
face value
of the bond when the
bond matures
. The par or face value of a corporate bond is typically stated as $1,000.
Investors can purchase the bond below its par value if a corporate bond is issued at a discount. An investor who purchases a bond for $920 at a discount will receive $1,000 when it reaches its maturity date. The $80 return plus coupon payments are the investor's earnings for holding the bond.
Not all bonds have coupon payments, however. Those that do not are referred to as zero-coupon bonds.
How Zero-Coupon Bonds Work
Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount, and they repay the par value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value represents the investor's return. The payment received by the investor is equal to the principal invested plus the interest earned, compounded semiannually at a stated yield.
The interest earned on a zero-coupon bond is an
imputed interest
. It's an estimated interest rate for the bond and not an established interest rate. A bond with a face value of $20,000 that matures in 20 years with a 5.5% yield may be purchased for roughly $6,855. The investor will receive $20,000 at the end of the 20 years.
The difference between $20,000 and $6,855 is $13,145. This represents the
interest that compounds
automatically until the bond matures. Imputed interest is sometimes referred to as ""phantom interest.""
The imputed interest on the bond is subject to federal
income tax
.

3
No coupon payments are made on zero-coupon bonds until maturity but investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on the imputed interest that accrues each year.
Purchasing a municipal zero-coupon bond, buying zero-coupon bonds in a tax-exempt account, or purchasing a corporate zero-coupon bond that has tax-exempt status are a few ways to avoid paying income taxes on these securities.
1
Pricing a Zero-Coupon Bond
The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated like this:
Price = M ÷ (1 + r)
n
where:
M = Maturity value or face value of the bond
r = required rate of interest
n = number of years until maturity
An investor would be willing to pay the following if they wanted to make a 6% return on a bond with a $25,000 par value that's due to mature in three years:
$25,000 / (1 + 0.06)
3
= $20,991.
The bond would be sold to the investor at $20,991 / $25,000 = 84% of the face value if the debtor accepted this offer. The investor gains $25,000 - $20,991 = $4,009 at maturity. This translates to 6% interest per year.
Important
The greater the length of time until the bond matures, the less the investor pays for it, and vice versa.
The maturity dates on zero-coupon bonds are usually long-term with initial maturities of at least 10 years. These long-term maturity dates let investors plan for long-range goals such as saving for a child’s college education. An investor can put up a small amount of money that grows over time with the bond's deep discount.
Zero-coupon bonds can be issued from a variety of sources including the U.S. Treasury, state and local government entities, and corporations. Most zero-coupon bonds trade on the major exchanges.
1
How Does a Zero-Coupon Bond Differ From a Regular Bond?
Payment of interest or coupons is the key difference between a zero-coupon and a regular bond.
Regular bonds are also called coupon bonds. They pay interest over the life of the bond and then repay the principal at maturity.
A zero-coupon bond doesn't pay interest but instead trades at a deep discount. This gives investors a profit at maturity when they redeem the bond for its full face value.
1
How Does an Investor Price a Zero-Coupon Bond?
The primary factor to consider is the imputed interest rate that the investor will earn at maturity. The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated using this equation:
Zero-coupon bond price = Maturity value ÷ (1 + required interest rate)^number years to maturity.
How Does the IRS Tax Zero-Coupon Bonds?
Imputed interest, sometimes referred to as ""phantom interest,"" is an estimated interest rate. The imputed interest on the bond is subject to income tax. The IRS uses an accretive method when calculating the imputed interest on
Treasury bonds
. It sets a minimum interest rate relative to imputed interest and the original price discount.
2
The Bottom Line
Zero-coupon bonds are an alternative to better-known coupon bonds that pay regular interest to their investors. Zero-coupon bonds pay no interest, but they're purchased at a deep discount and repaid at full price.
Most zero-coupon bonds are long-term issues. Ten or more years is common. They're often used to finance a long-range goal such as paying for a child's college education.
One big thing to consider: The owners of zero-coupon bonds pay a ""phantom interest"" tax on the bonds' earnings through the years they hold them.

Comparative advantage is an economy's inherent ability to produce a product or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners.
What Is Comparative Advantage?
Comparative advantage is an economy's inherent ability to produce a product or service at a lower
opportunity cost
than its trading partners. For example, China's low labor costs give it a comparative advantage as a manufacturer over many Western trading partners. South Africa has a comparative advantage in mining because of its mineral wealth.
Comparative advantage is used to explain why companies, countries, or individuals can benefit from trade.
In the context of international trade, comparative advantage refers to the products that a country
can produce more cheaply
or easily than other countries. However, some contemporary economists contend that focusing solely on comparative advantage can result in the exploitation and depletion of a country's resources.
The law of comparative advantage is popularly attributed to English political economist
David Ricardo
and his book ""On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation"" written in 1817, although it is likely that Ricardo's mentor, James Mill, originated the analysis.
1
Key Takeaways
Comparative advantage is a key element in international trade. Nations will export the goods that they can produce most efficiently and import those that it cannot produce efficiently.
A comparative advantage can be a skilled labor force, a natural resource, a favorable climate, or a stable political system.
The theory of comparative advantage introduces opportunity cost as a factor for analysis in choosing among options for export and import.
Investopedia / Joules Garcia
Understanding Comparative Advantage
Comparative advantage is one of the most important concepts in economic theory and a fundamental tenet of the argument that all actors, at all times, can mutually benefit from cooperation and voluntary trade. It is also a foundational principle in the theory of
international trade
.

The key to understanding comparative advantage is a solid grasp of opportunity cost. Put simply, an opportunity cost is a potential benefit that someone loses out on when selecting a particular option over another.
In the case of comparative advantage, the opportunity cost (that is to say, the potential benefit that has been forfeited) for one company is lower than that of another. The company with the lower opportunity cost, and thus the smallest potential benefit which was lost, holds this type of advantage.
Another way to think of comparative advantage is as the best option given a trade-off. If you're comparing two different options, each of which has a trade-off (some benefits as well as some disadvantages), the one with the best overall package is the one with the comparative advantage.
Diversity of Skills
People learn their comparative advantages through
wages
. This drives people into those jobs that they are comparatively better at. If a skilled mathematician earns more money as an engineer than as a teacher, they and everyone they trade with are better off when they practice engineering.
Wider gaps in opportunity costs allow for higher levels of value production by organizing labor more efficiently. The greater the diversity in people and their skills, the greater the opportunity for beneficial trade through comparative advantage.
Example of Comparative Advantage
As an example, consider a famous athlete like Michael Jordan. As a renowned basketball and baseball star, Michael Jordan is an exceptional athlete whose physical abilities surpass those of most other individuals. Michael Jordan would likely be able to, say, paint his house quickly, owing to his abilities as well as his impressive height.
Hypothetically, say that
Michael Jordan
could paint his house in eight hours. In those same eight hours, though, he could also take part in the filming of a television commercial which would earn him $50,000. By contrast, Jordan's neighbor Joe could paint Jordan's house in 10 hours. In that same period of time, he could also work at a fast food restaurant and earn $100.
In this example, Joe has a comparative advantage as a house painter due to his lower opportunity cost, and despite the fact that Michael Jordan could paint the house faster and better. The best trade would be for Michael Jordan to film a television commercial and to pay Joe to paint his house. So long as Michael Jordan makes the expected $50,000 and Joe earns more than $100, the trade is a winner. Owing to their diversity of skills, Michael Jordan and Joe would likely find this to be the best arrangement for their mutual benefit.
Comparative Advantage vs. Absolute Advantage
Comparative advantage is contrasted with
absolute advantage
. Absolute advantage refers to the ability to produce more or better goods and services than somebody else. Comparative advantage refers to the ability to produce goods and services at a lower opportunity cost, not necessarily at a greater volume or quality.
To see the difference, consider an attorney and their secretary. The attorney is better at producing legal services than the secretary and is also a faster typist and organizer. In this case, the attorney has an absolute advantage in both the production of legal services and secretarial work.
Nevertheless, they benefit from trade thanks to their comparative advantages and disadvantages. Suppose the attorney produces $175 per hour in legal services and $25 per hour in secretarial duties. The secretary can produce $0 in legal services and $20 in secretarial duties in an hour. Here, the role of opportunity cost is crucial.
To produce $25 in income from secretarial work, the attorney must lose $175 in income by not practicing law. Their opportunity cost of secretarial work is high. They are better off by producing an hour's worth of legal services and hiring the secretary to type and organize. The secretary is much better off typing and organizing for the attorney; their opportunity cost of doing so is low. It’s where their comparative advantage lies.
Important
Comparative advantage is a key insight that trade will still occur even if one country has an absolute advantage in all products.
Comparative Advantage vs. Competitive Advantage
Competitive advantage
refers to a company, economy, country, or individual's ability to provide a stronger value to consumers as compared with its competitors. It is similar to, but distinct from, comparative advantage.
In order to assume a competitive advantage over others in the same field or area, it's necessary to accomplish at least one of three things: the company should be the low-cost provider of its goods or services, it should offer superior goods or services than its competitors, or it should focus on a particular segment of the consumer pool.
Comparative Advantage in International Trade
David Ricardo famously showed how England and Portugal both benefit by specializing and trading according to their comparative advantages. In this case, Portugal was able to make wine at a low cost, while England was able to cheaply manufacture cloth. Ricardo predicted that each country would eventually recognize these facts and stop attempting to make the product that was more costly to generate.
Indeed, as time went on, England stopped producing wine, and Portugal stopped manufacturing cloth. Both countries saw that it was to their advantage to stop their efforts at producing these items at home and, instead, to trade with each other in order to acquire them.
Fast Fact
Comparative advantage is closely associated with free trade, which is seen as beneficial, whereas tariffs closely correspond to restricted trade and a zero-sum game.
A contemporary example: China’s comparative advantage with the United States is in the form of cheap labor. Chinese workers produce simple consumer goods at a much lower opportunity cost. The United States’ comparative advantage is in specialized, capital-intensive labor. American workers produce sophisticated goods or investment opportunities at lower opportunity costs. Specializing and trading along these lines benefit each.
The theory of comparative advantage helps to explain why
protectionism
is typically unsuccessful. Adherents to this analytical approach b",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp

A t-test measures the difference between the means of two samples.
What Is a T-Test?
A t-test is an inferential
statistical
test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related.
T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.
The t-test assists in hypothesis testing in statistics and uses the t-statistic, the
t-distribution
values, and the degrees of freedom to determine statistical significance.
Key Takeaways
A t-test can shed light on a statistically significant difference between the means of two data sets.
It is used for hypothesis testing in statistics.
Calculating a t-test requires the difference between the mean values from each data set, the standard deviation of each group, and the number of data values.
T-tests can be dependent or independent.
Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang
Understanding the T-Test
A t-test compares the mean values of two samples to determine a statistically significant difference.
For example, the grades of students from a physics class and those of a different group of students from a writing class would not likely have the same mean and standard deviation.

Similarly, samples taken from the placebo-fed control group of a drug test and those taken from the drug-prescribed group should have a slightly different mean and standard deviation.
Four assumptions are made while using a t-test:
The data collected must follow a continuous or ordinal scale, such as the scores for an IQ test.
The data is collected from a randomly selected portion of the total population
The data will result in a normal distribution of a bell-shaped curve.
Equal or homogenous variance exists when the standard variations are equal.
Mathematically, the t-test takes a sample from each of the two sets and establishes the problem statement. It assumes a null hypothesis, which means that it assumes the two means are equal.
Using the t-test formulas, values are calculated and compared against the standard values. This comparison
helps to determine the effect of chance
on the difference, and whether the difference is outside that chance range.
The t-test questions whether the difference between the groups represents a true difference in the study or merely a random difference.
Based on the results, the assumed null hypothesis is accepted or rejected. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it indicates that data readings are strong and are probably not due to chance.
Null hypothesis rejected
: Differences are statistically significant
Null hypothesis accepted
: Differences are not statistically significant
The t-test is just one of many tests used for this purpose. Others may be more appropriate depending on the number of variables or the size of the sample.
For example, statisticians use a
z-test
for data sets with a large sample size. Other testing options include the chi-square test and the f-test.
Example of When a T-Test Would Be Useful
Imagine that a drug manufacturer tests a new medicine. Following standard procedure, the drug is given to one group of patients, and a placebo is given to another group called the control group.
The placebo is a substance with no therapeutic value and serves as a benchmark to measure how the other group, administered the actual drug, responds.
After the drug trial, the members of the control group reported an increase in average life expectancy of three years. Members of the group that was prescribed the new drug reported an increase in average life expectancy of four years.
Initial observation indicates that the drug is working. However, it is also possible that the observation may be due to chance.
A t-test could be used to determine if the results are significant and applicable to the entire population, or whether they are random and not due to the drug intervention.
Using the T-Test
Calculating a t-test requires three fundamental data values:
The difference between the mean values from each data set, also known as the mean difference
The
standard deviation
of each group
The number of data values of each group
The t-test produces two values as its output: t-value and
degrees of freedom
. The t-value, or t-score, is a ratio of the difference between the mean of the two sample sets and the variation that exists within the sample sets.
The numerator is the difference between the mean of the two sample sets. The denominator is the variation that exists within the sample sets and is a measurement of the dispersion or variability.
This calculated t-value is then compared against a value obtained from a critical value table called the T-distribution table.
Higher values of the t-score indicate that a large difference exists between the two sample sets. The smaller the t-value, the more similarity exists between the two sample sets.
Degrees of freedom refers to the values in a study that have the freedom to vary and are essential for assessing the importance and the validity of the null hypothesis.
Computation of these values usually depends upon the number of data records available in the sample set.
Important
A large t-score, or t-value, indicates that the groups are different while a small t-score indicates that the groups are similar.
Types of T-Tests
Paired Sample T-Test Formula
The paired t-test, or correlated t-test, is a dependent type of test and is performed when the samples consist of
matched pairs
of similar units, or when there are cases of repeated measures.
For example, there may be instances where the same patients are repeatedly tested before and after receiving a particular treatment. Each patient is being used as a control sample against themselves.
This method also applies to cases where the samples are related or have matching characteristics, like a comparative analysis involving children, parents, or siblings.
The formula to compute the t-value and degrees of freedom for a paired t-test is:

An irrevocable trust can't be changed or cancelled unless its beneficiary or a court allows it.
What Is an Irrevocable Trust?
The purpose of an irrevocable trust is to move
assets
from the
grantor's
control and name to that of the
beneficiary
. This protects the assets from
creditors
and reduces the value of the grantor's estate, which lowers
estate taxes
.
Irrevocable trusts can't be modified, amended, or terminated without the permission of the grantor's beneficiary or by the order of a court. The exact rules can vary by state.
Key Takeaways
An irrevocable trust offers tax-shelter benefits that revocable trusts do not.
An irrevocable trust can't be altered or canceled without permission from the grantor's beneficiaries or by court order.
The grantor relinquishes their ownership of their assets to the trust.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
How an Irrevocable Trust Works
Irrevocable trusts are generally set up to minimize estate taxes, access government benefits, and protect assets. This is in contrast to a
revocable trust
. With a revocable trust, the grantor can modify or cancel the trust. However, there is no creditor protection.
With an irrevocable trust, the grantor transfers ownership of the assets to the trust, legally removing all
incidents of ownership
. This removes the trust's assets from the grantor's
taxable estate
. It also relieves the grantor of the tax liability on the income generated by the assets.
1
While the tax rules vary between jurisdictions, the grantor can't receive these benefits if they are the
trustee
(the person with a
fiduciary duty
to hold the assets in trust for the beneficiary).
Fast Fact
The assets held in the trust can include (but are not limited to) a business, investment assets, cash, and life insurance policies.
Irrevocable trusts are especially useful for individuals who work in professions that may make them vulnerable to lawsuits, such as doctors or attorneys. Once an asset is transferred to such a trust, it is owned by the trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries. Therefore, it is safe from legal judgments and
creditors
since the trust will not be a party to any lawsuit.

Today’s irrevocable trusts come with many provisions that were not commonly found in older versions of these instruments. These additions allow for much greater flexibility in trust management and distribution of assets. Provisions such as decanting, which allows a trust to be moved into a newer trust with more modern or advantageous provisions, can ensure that the trust assets will be managed effectively.
2
Other features that allow the trust to change its state of domicile can provide additional tax savings or other benefits.
Types of Irrevocable Trusts
Irrevocable trusts come in two forms: living trusts and testamentary trusts.
A
living trust
, which is also known as an
inter vivos
(Latin for ""between the living"") trust, is originated and funded by an individual during their lifetime. Examples of living trusts include the following.
Irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT)
Grantor-retained annuity trust (GRAT)
, spousal lifetime access trust (SLAT), and
qualified personal residence trust (QPRT)
(all types of lifetime gifting trusts)
Charitable remainder trust
and
charitable lead trust
(both forms of charitable trusts)
Testamentary trusts
, on the other hand, are irrevocable by design. That's because they are created after the death of their creator and are funded from the deceased's estate according to the terms of their
will
.
3
Important
The sole way to make changes to a testamentary trust or cancel it is to alter the will of the trust's creator before they die.
Irrevocable Trust Uses
Irrevocable trusts have many applications in planning for the preservation and distribution of an estate, including:
To take advantage of the
estate tax
exemption and remove taxable assets from the estate. Property transferred to an irrevocable living trust does not count toward the gross value of an estate. Such trusts can be especially helpful in reducing the tax liability of very large estates.
To prevent beneficiaries from misusing assets. (The grantor can set conditions for distribution.)
To gift assets to the estate while still retaining the income from the assets.
To remove
appreciable assets
from the estate while still providing beneficiaries with a
step-up basis
in valuing the assets for tax purposes.
To gift a
principal residence
to children under more favorable tax rules.
To house a
life insurance policy
that would effectively remove the death proceeds from the estate.
To deplete one's property to ensure eligibility for government benefits, such as Social Security income and Medicaid (for nursing home care). Such trusts can also be used to help secure benefits and care for a special needs child by preventing disqualification of eligibility.

5
Irrevocable Trusts vs. Revocable Trusts
Revocable trusts may be amended or canceled at any time as long as their creator is mentally competent. They do offer the benefit of allowing their creator to cancel them and reclaim
property
held by the trust at any time before death. However, such trusts do not offer the same
protection against legal action
or estate taxes as irrevocable trusts.
6
When using revocable trusts, government entities will consider that any property held in one still belongs to the trust's creator and therefore may be included in their estate for tax purposes or when qualifying for government benefits.
7
5
Once a revocable trust's creator dies, the trust becomes irrevocable.
8
SECURE Act Rules
The
Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act
changes some of the tax-saving benefits of
see-through trusts
.
Previously, certain non-spousal beneficiaries of retirement accounts that had been placed in an irrevocable trust could take their distributions over their
life expectancy
. However, under the SECURE Act rules, some beneficiaries may find they must take a full distribution by the end of the tenth calendar year following the year of the grantor's death.
9
How Does an Irrevocable Trust Work?
An irrevocable trust cannot be changed or cancelled without a court order or the beneficiary's permission. Essentially, an irrevocable trust removes certain assets from a grantor’s taxable estate, and these incidents of ownership are transferred to the trust. A grantor may choose this structure to relieve assets in the trust from tax liabilities, along with other benefits, like protection from creditors and lawsuits.
What Is the Difference Between an Irrevocable and a Revocable Trust?
Whereas irrevocable trusts can't be changed or terminated, revocable trusts can be changed or terminated. And though irrevocable trusts offer protection from creditors and lawsuits, revocable trusts do not.
Who Controls an Irrevocable Trust?
Under an irrevocable trust, legal ownership of the trust is held by a trustee. At the same time, the grantor gives up certain rights to the trust. Once an irrevocable trust is established, the grantor cannot control or change the assets once they have been transferred into the trust, unless the beneficiary gives them permission to do so.
The Bottom Line
Irrevocable trusts can minimize estate taxes and protect assets. There are two different types: living trusts, created and funded by an individual during their lifetime, and testamentary trusts, which are created after the death of their creator according to the terms of their will. Irrevocable trusts are more complex arrangements than revocable trusts and may have current and future tax implications, so it's best to consult a tax or estate attorney if you're contemplating setting one up.

Definition
Demand is a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a specific price for them.
What Is Demand?
Demand is a consumer's willingness to buy something, and demand is generally related to the price that consumer would have to pay. Generally speaking, demand increases when prices drop and decreases when prices rise. Market demand is the total quantity demanded by all consumers in a market for a given good, and aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy.
Key Takeaways
The law of demand concerns consumers' changing desire to purchase goods and services at given prices.
Demand can refer to either market demand for a specific good or aggregate demand for the total of all goods in an economy.
Demand and supply determine the actual prices of goods and the volume that changes hands in a market.
Businesses study demand to price products to meet demand and generate profits.
The demand curve demonstrates visually how the decreasing price for a product increases the quantity purchased.
Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin
Understanding Demand
As noted above, demand refers to how many goods and services a consumer purchases at a certain price. Shoppers tend to
buy more products and services when prices are low
. When prices rise, shoppers buy fewer or perhaps none at all.
Businesses spend a lot of money to determine the demand for their products and services. Incorrect estimates can result in lost sales from willing buyers if demand is underestimated or losses from leftover
inventory
if demand is overestimated. Demand helps fuel profits and the economy. That's why it's an important concept.
Demand is closely related to the concept of
supply
. While consumers try to pay the lowest prices they can for goods and services, suppliers try to maximize profits. Demand drops if suppliers charge too much for a product and suppliers may not sell enough to earn sufficient profits. If suppliers charge too little, the quantity demanded increases but lower prices may not cover suppliers’ costs or allow for profits.
Some factors affecting demand include the appeal of a good or service, the availability of competing goods, the availability of financing, and the
perceived availability
of a good or service.
Fast Fact
Demand elasticity relates to how sensitive the demand for a product is as its price changes. For example, if there's a big change in demand due to a small price change, demand elasticity is high. Shoppers may choose attractive substitute products if the price for their usual product has increased somewhat. That could indicate high demand elasticity and is useful for businesses to know.
What Determines Demand?
Five main factors drive demand:
Product/service price:
When prices are low, demand usually increases.
Buyer's income:
Demand tends to increase when people earn more and have more money to spend.
Prices of
substitute
goods:
Substitute goods can satisfy demand for a similar product. When the price for substitutes rises, demand for the original product may increase.
Consumer preferences:
Demand generally increases when people develop a preference for that product.
Consumer expectations for a price change:
Consumer demand will likely increase if they expect prices to rise in the future.
As these factors change, so can the demand for a product or service. They change all the time, so demand can be constantly in flux.
The Law of Demand
The law of demand highlights the
inverse relationship
between demand and prices. It states that when prices rise, demand will fall. Conversely, when prices fall, demand will rise.
The law of demand involves price only. None of the other drivers of demand mentioned above are involved. As such, things like consumer preferences, substitutes, and price expectations don't apply. If they do come into play, the functioning of the law can be affected. Demand can be seen to change for reasons other than price.
Demand Curve
A
demand curve
is a graph that displays the change in demand resulting from a price change. It's a visual representation of the law of demand. It's a useful tool for businesses because it can show them the prices at which consumers buy more or less. It can point out prices at which a company can maintain consumer demand and support reasonable profits.
The vertical axis on a demand curve graph denotes the price, while the horizontal axis denotes the
quantity demanded
. A
demand schedule
, or a table created by a business that lists the quantity of a product that consumers will buy at particular price points, can provide the figures for the demand curve chart.
Once plotted, the demand curve slopes downward, from left to right. As prices increase, consumers demand less of a good or service. A
supply curve
, on the other hand, slopes upward. As prices increase, suppliers provide more of a good or service.
Market Equilibrium
The point where supply and demand curves intersect represents the market clearing or market equilibrium price. An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right. The two curves then intersect at a higher price, which means consumers are willing to pay more for the product.
Equilibrium prices
typically change for most goods and services because factors affecting supply and demand always change. Free, competitive markets tend to push prices toward market equilibrium.
Market Demand vs. Aggregate Demand
The market for each good in an economy faces a different set of circumstances, which vary in type and degree. In
macroeconomics
, we also look at aggregate demand in an economy.
Aggregate demand
refers to the total demand by all consumers for all goods and services in an economy across all the markets for individual goods.
Since aggregate demand includes all goods in an economy, it is neither sensitive to competition, the substitution of goods, nor due to changes in consumer preferences between various goods. Demand in individual goods markets can be affected by these factors.
Demand and Macroeconomic Policy
Fiscal and monetary authorities, such as the
Federal Reserve
, devote much of their macroeconomic policy-making to managing aggregate demand.
If the Fed wants to reduce demand, it can raise interest rates and increase prices by curtailing the growth of the
money supply
and credit. If it needs to increase demand, the Fed can lower interest rates and increase the money supply, giving consumers and businesses more money to spend.
1
In certain cases, even the Fed can’t fuel demand. When unemployment is on the rise, people may not be able to afford to spend or take on cheaper debt, even with low interest rates.
What Are Some of the Types of Demand?
Demand is an economic concept that indicates how much of a good or service a person will buy based on its price. Demand can be categorized into various categories, but the most common are:
Competitive demand, which is the demand for products that have close substitutes
Composite demand or demand for one product or service with multiple uses
Derived demand
, which is the demand for something that stems from the demand for a different product
Joint demand or the demand for a product that is related to demand for a complementary good
What Is the Demand Curve?
The demand curve is a graphical representation of the law of demand. It plots prices on a chart. The line that connects those prices is the demand curve. The vertical axis represents the prices of products. The horizontal axis represents product quantity. Typically, the curve starts on the left side high up the vertical axis, and descends across the chart to the right. The slope indicates that as prices decrease, demand, as shown by a growing number of products purchased, increases.
Why Is Demand Important?
Economically speaking, the principle of demand is important for both consumers and businesses that sell products and/or services. For businesses, understanding demand is vital when making decisions about inventory, pricing, and aiming for a particular profit. Consumers who have an understanding of demand can make confident decisions about what products to buy and when to buy them.
The Bottom Line
Demand is a core economic concept that shows how much of a good or service consumers are willing to buy at different prices. The concept is used by businesses to determine prices and used by consumers to know when to make a purchase. The demand curve visually depicts how demand changes in relation to price: when price increases, demand decreases; when price decreases, demand increases.

Investopedia,Zero-Rated Goods: Definition and Examples,"Close
What Are Zero-Rated Goods?
Zero-rated goods, in countries that use
value-added tax (VAT)
, are products that are exempt from that value taxation.
Key Takeaways
Zero-rated goods are products that are exempt from value-added taxation (VAT).
Countries designate products as zero-rated because they are leading contributors to other manufactured goods and a significant component of a broader supply chain.
Often, goods and services that are zero-rated are those that are considered necessary, such as food items, sanitary products, and animal feeds.
Examples of zero-rated goods include certain foods and beverages, exported goods, equipment for the disabled, prescription medications, water, and sewage services.
Understanding Zero-Rated Goods
In most countries, the government mandates a domestic VAT requirement for goods and services. In most reported data, the total price of products sold in a country includes the VAT and is an additional charge to
sales tax
in most transactions. The VAT is a form of consumption tax.
Countries using VAT designate certain goods as zero-rated goods. Zero-rated goods are typically individualized items. Countries designate these products as zero-rated because they are leading contributors to other manufactured goods and a significant component of a broader
supply chain
. Also, many food items are identified as zero-rated goods and sell with 0% VAT.
Examples of items that may be zero-rated include certain foods and beverages,
exported goods
, donated goods sold by charity shops, equipment for the disabled, prescription medications, water, and sewage services, books and other printed publications, and children's clothing.
In many cases, buyers use zero-rated goods in production and benefit from paying a lower price for the goods without the tax. A food manufacturer may use zero-rated goods in the manufacturing of a food product, but when the consumer buys the final product, it includes a VAT.
Overall, the absence of VAT on zero-rated goods results in a lower total purchase price for the goods. Zero-rated goods can save buyers a significant amount of money. In the United Kingdom, for example, the standard VAT rate levied on most goods is 20%, and the reduced rate is 5%.
1
International Dealings with Zero-Rated Goods
When a consumer brings a good from one country to another, either individually or via a shipment, there is generally an international VAT charge in addition to any import or export
tariffs
due. Internationally designated zero-rated goods are not subject to international VAT, so the cost of importing or exporting them is lower.
Exempt Goods
Some goods and services are also reported as exempt from VAT. These exempt goods and services are typically a focused group provided by a seller that is not subject to VAT.
The European Commission, for example, exempts goods such as finance and
insurance
services, and some land building supplies. Other examples of exempt goods are those that serve the public interest, such as medical and dental care, social services, and education.
2
Zero-Rated Goods Example
Often, goods and services that are zero-rated are those that are considered necessary, such as food items, sanitary products, and animal feeds. Zero-rating these items makes them more affordable for lower-income consumers.
For example, in 2018, an independent panel at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa made the recommendation to add several items to the country’s list of zero-rated food items. White bread, cake flour, bread flour, baby and adult diapers, sanitary products, and school uniforms were some of the items.
The recommendation came on the heels of an increase in the VAT rate in South Africa from 14% to 15%, a move that was opposed by many, who saw it as harmful to lower-income households. The country's finance minister at the time, Nhlanhla Nene, appointed the independent panel, which was headed by professor Ingrid Woolard, who teaches economics at the University of Stellenbosch.
The panel’s recommendations expanded an existing list of 19 zero-rated food items, including brown bread, fruits, vegetables, dried beans, rice, lentils, maize meal, milk, eggs, fish, mealie rice, and vegetable oil.

Withholding tax is the income tax an employer deducts from an employee's paycheck.
What Is Withholding Tax?
The term ""withholding tax"" refers to the money that an employer deducts from an employee’s gross wages and pays directly to the government. The amount withheld is a credit against the income taxes the employee must pay during the year.
The vast majority of people who are employed in the United States are subject to tax withholding. Nonresident aliens are also subject to withholding taxes on earned income as well as on other income such as interest and
dividends
from the securities of U.S. companies that they own.
Key Takeaways
Withholding
tax is a set amount of income tax that an employer withholds from an employee’s paycheck.
Employers remit withholding taxes directly to the IRS in the employee's name.
The tax withholding is a credit against the employee’s annual income tax bill.
If too much money is withheld, an employee receives a tax refund; if too little is withheld, they may have to pay the IRS more with their tax return.
Withholding tax is deducted from payments to U.S. residents and nonresidents who earn money from American sources.
Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight
Understanding Withholding Tax
Tax withholding is a way for the U.S. government to maintain its pay-as-you-go (or
pay-as-you-earn
) income tax system. This means taxing individuals at the source of
income
rather than trying to collect income tax after wages are earned.
Here's How It Works
Whenever an employee gets paid, their employer withholds a certain percentage of their paycheck as
income tax
. This is then paid by the employer to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
.
The amount deducted appears on the employee's paystub and the total amount deducted annually can be found on
Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement
. Employers send W-2s to their employees each year to help them file their annual income tax returns.
The amount deducted depends on a
number of factors
. These considerations include the amount an employee earns, filing status, any withholding allowances claimed by the employee, and whether an employee requests that additional income be withheld. If merited, any excess is paid back to the employee by the IRS as a tax refund.
1
Tip
The IRS suggests verifying your withholding tax early in the year and whenever any changes are made to the tax law. You should also check it whenever you have changes in your lifestyle (filing status, marriage, divorce), wages, or when tax credits and deductions are changed.
1
Special Considerations
The majority of U.S. states also have
state income taxes
and employ tax withholding systems to collect taxes from their residents. States use a combination of the IRS W-4 Form and their own worksheets, which residents fill out to establish their withholding.
Nine states
do not impose income tax on residents. They are: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Withholding tax only applies to capital gains for high-earners living in Washington.
New Hampshire residents pay tax on interest and dividend income only.
2
However, they voted to gradually phase out this practice by 2027.

History of Withholding Taxes
Tax withholding first occurred in the U.S. in 1862 at the order of President Abraham Lincoln to help finance the Civil War. The federal government also implemented
excise taxes
for the same purpose. Tax withholding and income tax were abolished after the Civil War in 1872.
5
6
The current system was accompanied by a large tax hike when it was implemented in 1943.
5
At the time, it was thought that it would be difficult to collect taxes without getting them from the source. Most employees are subject to withholding taxes when they are hired and fill out a
W-4 Form
. The form estimates the amount of taxes that will be due.
7
The withholding tax is one of two types of
payroll taxes
. The other type is paid to the government by the employer and is based on an individual employee’s wages. This money contributes to funding for Social Security and federal unemployment programs (since the Social Security Act of 1935) as well as Medicare (since 1966).

Types of Withholding Taxes
There are two types of withholding tax employed by the IRS to ensure that proper tax is withheld in different situations: the U.S. resident and nonresident withholding tax.
U.S. Resident Withholding Tax
The first and more commonly discussed withholding tax is the one on U.S. residents’ personal income, which every employer in the U.S. must collect.
Under the current system
, employers collect the withholding tax and remit it directly to the government, with employees paying the remainder of what they may owe when they file a
tax return
in April each year.
11
If too much tax is withheld, the result is a
tax refund
. However, if not enough tax has been held back, then the individual will owe money to the IRS.
7
Generally, you want about 90% of your estimated income taxes withheld and sent to the government.
12
This ensures that you never fall behind on income taxes (something that can result in heavy penalties) and that you are not overtaxed throughout the year.
Investors and
independent contractors
are exempt from withholding taxes but are required to pay quarterly
estimated tax
.
13
If these classes of taxpayers fall behind, they can become liable to
backup withholding
, which is a higher rate of tax withholding set at 24%.
14
You can easily perform a paycheck checkup using the IRS’s tax withholding estimator.
15
This tool helps identify the correct amount of tax withheld from each paycheck to make sure that you don’t owe more when you file your annual return.
To use the estimator, you'll need your most recent pay stubs, your most recent income tax return, your estimated income during the current year, and other information.
Nonresident Withholding Tax
The other type of withholding tax is levied against
nonresident aliens
to ensure that proper taxes are paid on income sources from within the U.S.
16
A nonresident alien is someone who is foreign-born and has not passed the

You can calculate your withholding tax by using the
IRS Withholding Estimator
. In order to get an accurate figure, you'll need some basic information. Be sure to have the following handy when you're filling out the online form:
Your filing status
Your income source
Any additional income sources
The end date of your most recent pay period
Your wages per period and the
year-to-date (YTD)
totals
The amount of federal income tax per pay period and the total paid year-to-date
Whether you take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions
The amount of any tax credits you take
The estimator tells you how much of a refund or tax bill you can expect. You can also choose an estimated withholding amount that's suitable for you.
What Is the Purpose of Withholding Tax?
The purpose of withholding tax is to ensure that employees comfortably pay whatever income tax they owe. It maintains the pay-as-you-go tax collection system in the U.S. It fights
tax evasion
as well as the need to send taxpayers big, unaffordable tax bills at the end of the tax year.
How Much Tax Should You Have Withheld?
The amount of income tax you contribute from each paycheck depends on several factors, including total annual earnings and your
filing status
.

What Is Net Income (NI)?
Net income (NI), also called net earnings, is a useful number for investors to assess how much revenue exceeds the expenses of an organization. The formula to determine net income is sales minus
cost of goods sold
, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, depreciation, interest, taxes, and other expenses.
Net income appears on a company’s income statement and is an indicator of a company’s profitability. Net income also refers to an individual’s income after taking taxes and deductions into account.
Key Takeaways
Net income (NI) is calculated as revenue minus expenses, interest, and taxes.
Earnings per share (EPS) are calculated using NI.
Investors should review the numbers used to calculate NI because expenses can be hidden in accounting methods, or revenues can be inflated.
NI also represents an individual’s total earnings or pretax earnings after factoring deductions and taxes in gross income.
Laura Porter / Investopedia
Understanding Net Income (NI)
Businesses use net income to calculate their
earnings per share (EPS)
. Business analysts often refer to net income as the
bottom line
since it is at the bottom of the income statement. Analysts in the United Kingdom know NI as profit attributable to shareholders.
Important
Net income (NI) is known as the bottom line, as it appears as the last line on the income statement once all expenses, interest, and taxes have been subtracted from revenues.
Calculating Net Income for Businesses
To calculate net income for a business, start with a company’s total
revenue
. From this figure, subtract the business’s expenses and operating costs to calculate the business’s earnings before tax. Deduct tax from this amount to find the NI.
Net income, like other accounting measures, is susceptible to manipulation through such things as aggressive revenue recognition or hiding expenses. When basing an investment decision on NI,
investors
should review the quality of the numbers used to arrive at the taxable income and NI to ensure that they are accurate and not misleading.

Personal Gross Income vs. Net Income
Gross income
refers to an individual’s total earnings or pretax earnings, and NI refers to the difference after factoring deductions and taxes into gross income. To calculate taxable income, which is the figure used by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
to determine income tax, taxpayers subtract deductions from gross income. The difference between taxable income and
income tax
is an individual’s NI.
1
For example, an individual has $60,000 in gross income and qualifies for $10,000 in deductions. That individual’s taxable income is $50,000 with an effective tax rate of 13.88%, giving an income tax payment of $6,939.50 and NI of $43,060.50.
Net Income on Tax Returns
In the United States, individual taxpayers submit a version of
Form 1040
to the IRS to report annual earnings. This form does not have a line for net income. Instead, it has lines to record gross income,
adjusted gross income (AGI)
, and
taxable income
.
2
After noting their gross income, taxpayers subtract certain income sources such as Social Security benefits and qualifying deductions such as student loan interest. The difference is their AGI.
Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, net income and AGI are
two different things
. Taxpayers then subtract
standard
or
itemized deductions
from their AGI to determine their taxable income. As stated above, the difference between taxable income and income tax is the individual’s NI, but this number is not noted on individual tax forms.
Fast Fact
Most paycheck stubs have a line devoted to NI. This is the amount that appears on an employee’s check. The number is the employee’s gross income, minus taxes and any contributions to accounts such as a 401(k) or Health Savings Account (HSA).
What Is the Difference Between Net Income and Gross Income?
Gross income is the total amount earned. Net income is gross income minus expenses, interest, and taxes. Net income reflects the actual profit of a business or individual.
Is Net Income Before Taxes or After?
Net income is what a business or individual makes after taxes, deductions, and other expenses are taken out. In business, net income is what a company has left after all expenses are subtracted, including taxes, wages, and the cost of goods.
What Is a Company’s Income Statement?
An
income statement
is one of the three key documents used for reporting a company’s yearly financial performance. The income statement includes the gains, losses, revenue, and expenses that a company reports in that period. Net income is the bottom line on an income statement.
The Bottom Line
Net income, or net earnings, is the bottom line on a company’s income statement. It’s calculated by subtracting expenses, interest, and taxes from total revenues. Net income can also refer to an individual’s pretax earnings after subtracting deductions and taxes from gross income.
Earnings per share (EPS) are calculated using a business’s net income. These numbers should always be reviewed by investors to ensure that they are accurate and not inflated or misleading.

Investopedia,Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA): What It Is and How It Works,"Close
What Is the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)?
The term Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) refers to a law that allows a minor to receive gifts without the aid of a guardian or
trustee
. Gifts can include money, patents, royalties, real estate, and fine art.
A UTMA account allows the gift giver or an appointed custodian to manage the minor’s account until the latter is of age. It also shields the minor from tax consequences on the gifts, up to a specified value.
Key Takeaways
The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) allows a minor to receive gifts without the aid of a guardian or trustee.
The law is an extension of the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.
The minor named in the UTMA can avoid tax consequences until they attain legal age for the state in which the account is set up.
The donor can name a custodian, who has the fiduciary duty to manage and invest the property on behalf of the minor until they become of legal age.
It is up to individual states to adopt or amend the UTMA for its residents.
Understanding the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)
The UTMA is similar to the original version of the
Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)
. It allows minors to receive gifts and avoid tax consequences until they become of legal age in the state in which they live—typically 18 or 21 years of age. The UTMA incorporates the language of the UGMA and extends the original definition of gifts beyond cash and securities to include real estate, paintings,
royalties
, and
patents
.
1
The UTMA provides a convenient way for children to save and invest without carrying the tax burden. The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
allows for an exclusion from the
gift tax
of up to $18,000 per person for 2024, a $1,000 increase from the previous year, for a qualifying gift, including gifts to minors.
2
The minor’s
Social Security number (SSN)
is used for tax reporting purposes on UTMA accounts.
3
Because assets held in a UTMA account are owned by the minor, this may have a negative impact when the minor applies for
financial aid
or
scholarships
.

Each state has the option to adopt or amend the UTMA for its residents.
1
For example, South Carolina has not adopted the UTMA for its citizens, and Florida passed a statute in 2015 that allows any
property
to be held by the UTMA custodian until the minor is 25, if desired.
5
Important
Any earnings that are generated within a UTMA are taxed at the
kiddie tax
rate by the IRS up to the allotted threshold of $2,500.
6
Earnings after that are taxed at the adult donor’s marginal tax rate.
7
Special Considerations
The UTMA allows the donor to name a custodian, who has the
fiduciary duty
to manage and invest the property on behalf of the minor until that minor becomes of legal age.
8
The property belongs to the minor from the time the property is gifted.
9
If the donor dies while serving as custodian, the value of the custodianship property is included in the donor’s
estate
.
10
Warning
The assets in a UTMA are counted as part of the donor’s taxable estate until the minor takes possession.
11
Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) vs. Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)
As noted above, the UTMA is similar to an earlier version of the UGMA. In fact, it is an extension of the UGMA. The UGMA was developed in 1956 and revised in 1966. It is limited to the transfer of cash or securities. The UTMA was finalized in 1986. Both laws were approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and adopted by most of the 50 states, but each state can modify its statute.
1
The UGMA and UTMA provide a way to transfer property to a minor without the need for a formal
trust
. They allow
assets
to be managed by a
custodian
who is appointed by the donor. The assets are then turned over to the minor when they become of legal age in the state where the gift was made.
The primary difference between the UGMA and the UTMA is in the assets that are allowed in these accounts. UGMAs are limited to cash and securities, but many types of property can be transferred to minors in the UTMA, including:
Cash
Stocks and bonds
Patents
Royalties
Real estate
Fine art
Mutual funds
and other investments
Intellectual property
1
12
Contributions to a UGMA or UTMA are made using after-tax dollars, which means donors don’t receive a tax deduction for making them.
Just like a UTMA, gifts made to a UGMA are
tax free
up to $18,000 per person for 2024 and $19,000 per person for 2025.
2
Can a Minor Receive Gifts or Assets without a Guardian or Trustee?
Yes, a minor can receive gifts or assets without a guardian or trustee as it is stipulated in the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. The UTMA is a law that governs the transfer of assets from adults to minors. it provides parents and other adults with a
tax-advantaged
way to pass on gifts to minors without needing to create a formal trust. In doing so, the adult who donates the gift would typically act as the custodian for those assets until the minor reaches legal age. Alternatively, the donor can also appoint a third party to serve as the custodian of those assets.
1
What Is the Difference Between the UTMA and the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)?
The UTMA and the UGMA serve similar purposes, but there are important differences between them. Most notably, the UTMA allows for a
broader range of assets to be gifted
, including patents, royalties, real estate, and art.
1
The UTMA also provides additional time for the assets being gifted to reach their maturity dates, such as in the case of a bond. By contrast, the UGMA requires the assets to be assumed by the minor once the minor reaches 18 years of age.
What Are the Pros and Cons of Using a UTMA Account?
The main advantage of using a UTMA account is that the money contributed to the account is exempted from paying a gift tax of up to a maximum of $18,000 per year for 2024 and $19,000 per year for 2025.
2
Any income earned on the contributed funds is taxed at the tax rate of the minor who is being gifted the funds. Since the minor’s income is presumably significantly lower than that of the adult donor, this can lead to significant tax savings.
6
One of the drawbacks of using a UTMA account, however, is that it can make the recipient less eligible for need-based college scholarship programs and other such initiatives.
4
When Can a Child Claim Ownership of an UTMA Account?
Depending on the state, a UTMA account is handed over to a child when they reach either age 18 or age 21. In some jurisdictions, at age 18 a UTMA account can only be handed over with the custodian’s permission, and at 21 is transferred automatically. Inquire with the bank or brokerage where the UTMA is housed for clarification.
The Bottom Line
The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) is a law designed to allow a minor to receive gifts, including money, patents, royalties, real estate, fine art, securities, and more, without the aid of a guardian or trustee. It is similar to an earlier law, the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), which was limited to gifts of cash and securities.
UTMA accounts are often set up to help fund a child’s education, although it’s important to keep in mind that having a UTMA may impact a child’s qualification for financial aid or scholarships. A 529 plan may be a better choice for a child headed to college.

What Is Moore's Law?
Moore's Law states that the number of components on a single chip doubles every two years at minimal cost. While not actual science, it was an observation and extrapolation that has held steady since 1965.
Key Takeaways
Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years with a minimal cost increase.
In 1965, Gordon E. Moore, the co-founder of Intel, made an observation that eventually became known as Moore's Law.
Another tenet of Moore's Law says that the growth of microprocessors is exponential.
Investopedia / Joules Garcia
Understanding Moore's Law
In 1965, Gordon E. Moore—co-founder of Intel (
INTC
)—observed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit at minimum cost had increased by a factor of two between 1960 and 1965. Using his observations, he predicted that the number of components on a single chip at minimum cost would reach 65,000 by 1975. In 1975, he revised the prediction to state that the number of components per single chip would double every two years.
1
2
Gordon Moore did not call his observation ""Moore's Law,"" nor did he set out to create a ""law."" Moore made that statement based on noticing emerging trends in
chip manufacturing
at Fairchild Semiconductor. Eventually, Moore's insight became a well-known adage, ""Moore's Law."" In an interview in 1975, he claimed his friend, Dr. Carver Mead from CalTech, was responsible for the name.
1
In the decades that followed Gordon Moore's original observation,
Moore's Law guided the semiconductor industry
in long-term planning and setting targets for research and development (R&D). Moore's Law has been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth that are hallmarks of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
Important
Moore's Law implies that computers, machines that run on computers, and computing power all become smaller, faster, and cheaper with time as processes become more efficient and components smaller and faster.
Nearly 60 Years Old and Still Strong
Almost 60 years later, we still feel the lasting impact and benefits of Moore's Law in many ways.

Computing
As transistors in
integrated circuits
become smaller, computers shrink and become faster. Today, transistors are microscopic structures printed on small sheets of carbon and silicon molecules. The number of transistors that can be printed on a small space makes computers much more efficient and faster. The cost of higher-powered computers has over the longterm been dropping annually, partly because of lower labor costs and reduced semiconductor prices.
3
Electronics
Practically every facet of a high-tech society benefits from Moore's Law in action. Mobile devices, such as smartphones and computer tablets, would not work without tiny processors; neither would video games, spreadsheets, accurate weather forecasts, and
global positioning systems (GPS)
.
All Sectors Benefit
Moreover, smaller and faster computers improve transportation, health care, education, and energy production—to name but a few of the industries that have progressed because of the increased power of computer chips.
Moore's Law's Impending End
Some believe that the physical limits of Moore's Law should be reached at some point in the 2020s.
4
The issues chip-makers face are increasing costs to continue trying to meet the industry standard created by Moore's Law, and the difficulty cooling an increasing number of components in a small space. For instance, if you keep shrinking components, you can put more in a one-inch square chip. The more you put in that square inch, the hotter it gets and the harder it is to cool it.
In a 2005 interview, Moore himself admitted that ""...the fact that materials are made of atoms is the fundamental limitation and it's not that far away...We're pushing up against some fairly fundamental limits so one of these days we're going to have to stop making things smaller.""
5
Creating the Impossible?
The fact that Moore's Law may be approaching its natural end is perhaps most painfully present at the chip manufacturers themselves; as these companies are saddled with the task of building ever-more-powerful chips against the reality of physical limitations. Even
Intel is competing with itself and its industry
to create what ultimately may not be possible.
In 2012, with its 22-nanometer (nm) processor, Intel was able to boast of having the world's smallest and most advanced transistors in a mass-produced product.
6
In 2014, Intel launched an even smaller, more powerful 14nm chip; the company struggled to bring a 7nm chip to market, but finally, in 2024, the company began receiving parts for a school bus-sized machine that can create technology that ""pushes Moore's law forward.""
7
8
9
10
This machine, designed by ASML, is a High NA
Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography system
that can print transistors as small as 2nm.
11
Fast Fact
For perspective, one nanometer is one billionth of a meter, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. The diameter of an atom ranges from about 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers.
12
Special Considerations
The vision of an endlessly empowered and interconnected future brings both challenges and benefits. Shrinking transistors have powered advances in computing for more than half a century, but engineers and scientists must find other ways to make computers more capable soon. Instead of physical processes, applications and software may help improve the speed and efficiency of computers. Cloud computing, wireless communication, the Internet of Things (IoT), and quantum physics all may play a role in the future of computer tech innovation.
Despite the growing concerns around privacy and security, the advantages of ever-smarter computing technology can help keep us healthier, safer, and more productive in the long run.
What Is Moore's Law?
In 1965, Gordon Moore posited that roughly every two years, the number of transistors on microchips will double. Commonly referred to as Moore’s Law, this phenomenon suggests that computational progress will become significantly faster, smaller, and more efficient over time.
1
2
Widely regarded as one of the hallmark theories of the 21st century, Moore’s Law carries significant implications for the future of technological progress—along with its possible limitations.
How Has Moore’s Law Impacted Computing?
Moore’s Law has directly influenced the progress of computing power by creating a goal for chip makers to achieve. In 1965, Moore predicted that there would be 65,000 transistors per chip by 1975.
2
In 2024, chip makers can put 50 billion transistors on a chip the size of a fingernail.
13
Is Moore’s Law Coming to an End?
According to some, Moore's Law will end sometime in the 2020s.
4
If components continue to shrink, physical limits will be reached during this decade because it's unlikely that transistors smaller than atoms can be printed. There is only 1.5nm of space left to print on, depending on the element.
The Bottom Line
Moore's Law began as an observation made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of components on a microchip appeared to increase by a factor of two every year. He predicted that it was possible that by 1975, there would be 65,000 components on an integrated circuit. In 1975, he revised his observation and predicted that the number of components would double every two years. This prediction remained fairly accurate for nearly 50 years—and in 2024, engineers and scientists are still attempting to keep up; they have succeeded in printing transistors almost the size of atoms.

Investopedia,Zero Cost Collar: Definition and Example,"Close
What Is a Zero Cost Collar?
A zero cost collar is a form of options collar strategy that limits your losses. To execute it, you sell a short call option and buy a long put option whose prices cancel each other out. The downside of this strategy is that profits are capped if the underlying asset's price increases.
Key Takeaways
A zero cost collar strategy is used to hedge against volatility in an underlying asset's prices.
A zero cost collar strategy involves selling a short call and buying a long put that place a cap and floor on profits and losses for the underlying.
It may not always be successful because premiums or prices of different option types do not always match.
Understanding Zero Cost Collar
A zero cost collar strategy involves the outlay of money on one half of the strategy, which offsets the cost incurred by the other half. It is a protective options strategy implemented after your
long position
in a stock experiences substantial gains.
To create the position, you use a stock you own, buy a
protective put
, and sell a
covered call
. Other names for this strategy include zero cost options, equity risk reversals, and hedge wrappers.

To implement a zero cost collar, you buy an
out-of-the-money
put option (making the seller buy the underlying at strike) and simultaneously sell an out-of-the-money call option (hoping the buyer purchases the underlying at strike) with the same
expiration date
.
For example, imagine you purchased a stock for $100. One month later, it was trading at $120 per share. You want to lock in some gains, so you buy a put option with a $115
strike price
at $0.95 and sell a call with a $124 strike price for $0.95. In terms of dollars, the put will cost $0.95 x 100 shares per contract = $95.00. The call will create a credit of $0.95 x 100 shares per contract—the same $95.00. Therefore, the net cost of this trade is zero, and you've locked in profits.

Using the Zero Cost Collar
Executing this strategy is not always possible as the
premiums
—or prices—of the puts and calls do not always match exactly. Therefore, investors can decide how close to a net cost of zero they want to get. Choosing puts and calls that are out of the money by different amounts can result in a net credit or debit to the account.
The further out-of-the-money the option, the lower its premium. Therefore, to create a collar with only a minimal cost, you can choose a call option farther out of the money than the respective put option. In the previous example, that could be a strike price of $125.
To create a collar with a small credit to the account, you do the opposite—choose a put option farther out of the money than the respective call. In the example, that could be a strike price of $114.
Fast Fact
If the collar resulted in a net cost or debit, that outlay would reduce the profit. On the other hand, if the collar resulted in a net credit, that amount is added to the total profit.
At the expiration of the options, the maximum loss would be the difference between your purchase price and the value of the stock at the lower strike price, even if the underlying stock price fell sharply. The maximum gain would be the difference between the purchase price and the value of the stock at the higher strike, even if the underlying stock moved up sharply. If the stock closed within the strike prices, then there would be no effect on its value to you because the options would expire.
Is a Costless Collar Really Costless?
Buying and selling the option make the collar costless, although additional fees and costs might be associated with the trade.
What Is the Benefit of a Zero Cost Collar?
This strategy minimizes your losses if the market takes a turn for the worse. However, your gains are also minimized by selling the call. That will be the highest price you can get for your stock unless the buyer elects not to exercise.
What Is the Risk Reversal?
Risk reversal is the same strategy as a zero cost collar. You sell a call and buy a put on a long position to minimize the risk of significant losses.
The Bottom Line
The zero cost collar is a long position strategy that protects you from significant losses if the market drops. To create the collar, you buy a put with a lower strike price and sell a call with a higher strike price. This creates a safety net for you but also limits how much you can make on the underlying asset if the call purchaser exercises. There are other strategies that traders use to
manage risk reversal
. The
fence is one of these strategies
and uses three option contracts instead of the collar's two.

Correction—May 20, 2023:
A previous version of this article mistakenly stated that a trader needed to buy a call and put option to create a zero cost collar. This was inaccurate, as a trader buys a call and sells a put to create the collar.

Investopedia,"What Is a Wire Transfer? How It Works, Safety, and Fees","Close
What Is a Wire Transfer?
A wire transfer is an
electronic transfer
of funds via a network that is administered by banks and transfer service agencies around the world. Wire transfers are sent by one institution and received by another. They require information from the party initiating the transfer, such as the recipient's name and account number.
Wire transfers don't actually involve the physical exchange of
cash
but are settled electronically. They can be sent between banks, or through a non-bank service such as Western Union.
Key Takeaways
Wire transfers are sent electronically across a network of banks or transfer agencies around the world.
You must pay for a wire transfer when it's sent by the remitting bank and provide the recipient's name and bank account number, and the amount transferred.
Most wire transfers can take as long as two business days to process.
International wire payments are monitored by the Office of Foreign Assets Control to ensure the money isn't being wired to terrorist groups or for money laundering purposes.
1
All transfers go through a domestic automated clearing house before they are settled.
Understanding Wire Transfers
Wire transfers, which are also known as wire payments, allow you to move money quickly and securely without the need to send cash. They allow
two parties to transfer funds
even if they're in different (geographic) locations safely. A transfer is usually initiated from one bank or
financial institution
to another. Rather than cash, the participating institutions share information about the recipient, the bank receiving account number, and the amount transferred.
The sender pays for the transaction upfront at their bank. The sender must provide their bank with the following information:
The recipient's name, address, and contact number, along with any other personal information required to facilitate the transaction
The recipient's banking information, including their
account number
and branch number
The receiving bank's information, which includes the institution's name, address, and bank identifier (
routing number
or SWIFT code)

Once the information is documented, the wire transfer can begin. The initiating firm sends a message to the recipient's institution with payment instructions through a secure system, such as
Fedwire
or
SWIFT
. The recipient's bank receives the information from the initiating bank and deposits its own reserve funds into the correct account. The two banking institutions then settle the payment on the back end after the money has been deposited.
Wire transfers are important tools for anyone who needs to
send money quickly
and securely—especially when they aren't in the same location. They also allow entities to transfer a large amount of money. Firms do limit the amount that can be transferred, but these caps tend to be fairly high. For instance, one company may use a wire transfer to pay for a large purchase from an international supplier.
Fast Fact
Non-bank wire transfers do not require bank account numbers. One popular non-bank wire transfer company is Western Union, whose international money transfer service is available in more than 200 countries.
2
Types of Wire Transfers
There are two types of wire transfers: domestic and international.
Domestic Wire Transfers
A domestic wire transfer is any type of wire payment that takes place between two different banks or institutions within the same country. Senders may require a code or the recipient's branch number if they want to execute a transaction.
These transactions are generally processed on the same day they are initiated and can be received within a few hours. That's because a domestic wire transfer only has to go through a domestic
automated clearing house (ACH)
and can be delivered within a day.
International Wire Transfers
International wire transfers are initiated in one country and settled in another. Senders must initiate international transfers even when they send money to someone in another country who has an account at the same bank. These payments require a routing or SWIFT code.
These wire transfers are normally delivered within two
business days
. This extra day is required because international wires must clear a domestic
ACH
and also its foreign equivalent.
Important
Domestic wire transfers can cost up to $35 per transaction or more. International wire transfers often cost much more. Some receiving institutions also charge a fee, which is deducted from the total amount received by their customer.
Risks Associated With Wire Transfers
Wire transfers are generally safe and secure, provided you know the person who's receiving them. If you use a legitimate wire transfer service, each person involved in a wire transfer
transaction
should be required to prove their identity so that anonymous transfers are impossible.
International wire transfers that originate in the United States are monitored by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, an agency of the U.S. Treasury. The agency makes sure the money sent overseas is not being used to fund terrorist activities or for
money laundering
purposes. In addition, they are also tasked with preventing money from going to countries that are the subject of sanctions by the U.S. government.
If the agency suspects that any of these scenarios are true, the sending bank has the authority to
freeze
the funds and stop the wire transfer from going through.
1
Wire transfers may be flagged for several reasons, alerting officials to possible wrongdoing by either the recipient or the sender in the case of:
Transfers to safe-haven countries
Transfers to non-account holders
Regular transfers for no viable reason
Incoming and outgoing wires with the same dollar amount
Large amounts wired by cash businesses
Advantages and Disadvantages of Wire Transfers
Wire transfers offer a convenient way to send money and pay bills to a recipient who uses a different bank. International wire transfers now take only a few days to settle, and domestic wire transfers often settle on the same day. Unlike mailed checks, they are unlikely to be misplaced or lost in the mail. Moreover, they are also reliable: While checks can bounce, a wire transfer can only be initiated if the sender has sufficient funds in their account.
However, there are some drawbacks. Banks often charge a flat fee for wire transfers, which can range between $15 and $50. This can eat up a large percentage of the transferred amount, especially for smaller transactions. In addition, some banks place a limit on the amount that can be wired in a single day.
Moreover, evolutions in
fintech
have provided alternatives that may be even faster than wire transfers. Tools like
PayPal
and
Venmo
allow domestic transfers in extremely small amounts, even faster than a bank wire, and for lower (or no) fees.
Pros and Cons of Wire Transfers
Pros
Fast settlement, even across borders.
Cannot be bounced or held due to insufficient funds.
Cons
Bank fees make wires impractical for some amounts.
Banks may impose a limit on the maximum transfer.
Alternative payment methods can be even faster and cheaper than wires.
Alternatives to Wire Transfers
Checks and money orders:
Before computer networks, the main alternative to wire transfers was to mail a physical check or money order. This had obvious disadvantages since mail could sometimes be lost or delayed in transit. While it is also possible to pay by credit and debit over the phone, this method is vulnerable to credit card fraud.
Automated Clearinghouse:
If the money is not needed immediately, it is also possible to send payments through the
Automatic Clearinghouse (ACH)
, an electronic network run by the National Automatic Clearinghouse Association. Because they are often batched together, ACH transfers are frequently used for bill payments, payroll, or tax refunds, but they can also be used for one-time transactions.
Peer-to-peer financial services:
Peer-to-peer financial services such as
Venmo
,
Zelle
,
Square
, and
PayPal
provide a fast, convenient way to send money, with small or zero fees. Moreover, they do not require any banking information about the recipient in order to do so.
How Is a Wire Transfer Done?
A wire transfer is most often used to transfer funds
from one bank or financial institution to another
. No physical money is transferred between banks or financial institutions when conducting a wire transfer. Instead, information is passed between banking institutions about the recipient, the bank receiving account number, and the amount transferred.
The sender first pays for the transaction upfront at their bank. The sending bank sends a message to the recipient's bank with payment instructions through a secure system, such as Fedwire or SWIFT. The recipient's bank receives all the necessary information from the initiating bank and deposits its own reserve funds into the correct account.
The two banking institutions then settle the payment on the back end (after the money has already been deposited).
What Are the Advantages of Wire Transfers?
Wire transfers allow for the individualized transmission of funds from individuals or entities to others while still maintaining the efficiencies associated with the fast and secure movement of money. The sender can initiate a wire transfer quickly and the recipient can access the funds immediately as there are usually no bank holds on the money. Wire transfers also allow people in different locations to safely transfer money to locales and financial institutions around the globe.
How Safe Are Wire Transfers?

Investopedia,Zero-Volatility Spread (Z-Spread) Formula and Calculation,"Close
Definition
The zero-volatility spread (z-spread) is the constant spread that makes the price of a security equal to the present value of its cash flows when added to the yield at each point on the spot rate Treasury curve where cash flow is received.
Suppose you're considering two investments: a super-safe government bond and a riskier corporate bond. The zero-volatility spread (z-spread) helps you understand how much money you'd need to make from the riskier bond over its lifespan to make it worthwhile.
In short, the z-spread puts a number to the adage that the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward. The z-spread determines the added yield (or interest) an investor can earn from a corporate bond compared with a risk-free government bond. It measures the extra incentive or reward for taking on the risk of investing in a particular bond.
Key Takeaways
The zero-volatility spread (z-spread) of a bond tells the investor the bond's current value plus its cash flows at certain points on the Treasury curve where cash flow is received.
The z-spread is also called the static spread.
The spread is used by analysts and investors to discover discrepancies in a bond's price.
Also known as the
static spread
, this concept is often made to sound quite tricky, but it's intuitive. Suppose you're fresh out of college and offered a safe job with a local government agency, which promises a decent income and job security. It's an important agency, and it has never had job cuts in its entire history. Meanwhile, you're also offered a job with a startup business that a friend is forming. It offers potentially far higher pay through bonuses and stock options, but there's also a risk the company will struggle or even go out of business. How much more would you need to be offered to take the startup job? To make a decision, you need to know more than the initial salary difference; you also need to know the different effects they would have over your lifetime since you're comparing two career paths. So, how much would it take, on average, for each paycheck to make it worth the risk?
Calculating that difference related to higher and lower-risk bonds is precisely what the z-spread does. Below, we show you how it's measured and why it's crucial to any bond investor.
What the Zero-Volatility Spread (Z-Spread) Tells You
The z-spread is the constant spread that needs to be added to a benchmark yield curve to make the price of a bond equal to the present value of its cash flows. Below is a sample spread:
To understand this concept, let's return to our job analogy. Suppose you took the stable government job, but your friend calls again asking you to move over to the startup. The z-spread is like calculating the extra compensation package (salary, bonuses, and benefits) the startup needs to offer each year, over your entire career, to make the risky move worthwhile.
In bond terms, the government job is the yield curve of risk-free
Treasury
securities. These government securities are considered risk-free since the U.S. government has always paid such debts. The startup job is analogous to the greater risk, but potentially higher reward, of the corporate or other non-government bond you're considering. The z-spread gives you a measure of how much more in yield the riskier bond must offer at every point along its life cycle to match the value of the safe Treasury bonds.
Here are key aspects of the z-spread:
It's a comprehensive measure
: Unlike simpler spread calculations, the z-spread accounts for the entire yield curve, not just at a single point.
Quantifies your risk
: It effectively measures the premium investors demand for taking on the additional risk of a non-Treasury security.
Present value comparison
: The z-spread ensures that the present value of the bond's cash flow, when discounted at the Treasury yield plus the spread, equals the bond's market price.
Constant spread
: The ""zero-volatility"" in the name of the spread refers to how the spread remains constant across all maturities of the yield curve.
As such, the z-spread is different from the nominal spread. A nominal spread calculation uses one point on the Treasury yield curve (not the spot-rate Treasury yield curve) to determine the spread at a single point that will equal the present value of the security's cash flows to its price.
The z-spread helps analysts
discover if there is a discrepancy
in a bond's price. Because the z-spread measures the spread that an investor will receive over the entirety of the Treasury yield curve, it gives analysts a more realistic value of a security instead of a single-point metric, such as a bond's maturity date.
Formula and Calculation for the Zero-Volatility Spread
To calculate a z-spread, an investor must take the Treasury spot rate at each relevant maturity, add the z-spread to this rate, and then use this combined rate as the discount rate to calculate the price of the bond. The formula to calculate a z-spread is as follows:

Example
Assume a bond is currently priced at $104.90. It has three future cash flows: a $5 payment next year, a $5 payment two years from now, and a final total payment of $105 in three years. The Treasury spot rate at the one-, two-, and three-year marks are 2.5%, 2.7%, and 3%.
We need to find the z-spread that equates the bond price to the present value of these cash flows. Those cash flows are determined by discounting the two $5 cash flows and the final $105 payment to find their present value. This is done by dividing each cash flow by one plus the sum of the Treasury spot rate for that period (2.5%, 2.7%, and 3.0% in our example) and the z-spread, raised to the power of two times the number of the period:

We can then calculate the
net present value
of the three cash flows:
4.8696 + 4.7176 + 95.3157 = 104.9029
Given that our bond price is $104.90 and the calculated present value of the cash flows is about $104.9029, we adjust the z-spread slightly to match the bond price exactly. In this case, the z-spread is found to be the following:
$140.9029 - 140.9000 = 0.0029, or 0.29%.
Why Is the Z-Spread Important for Mortgage-Backed Securities?
The z-spread is particularly useful for analyzing mortgage-backed securities (
MBS
) because it considers the spread across the entire yield curve, providing a clearer picture of the bond's value. Given the complexity and varied cash flows of an MBS, the z-spread helps investors assess the true yield and risk by discounting each cash flow at the correct rate.
Can a Z-Spread Be Negative?
Yes, the z-spread on a bond can be negative if it's trading at a
premium
compared with
risk-free
Treasury securities. This would indicate that investors are willing to accept a lower yield because of factors such as superior credit quality, higher liquidity, or other attractive bond features.
How Does the Z-Spread Help in Credit Risk Assessment?
The z-spread provides insights into the credit risk of a bond by comparing its yield to the risk-free Treasury yield curve. A higher z-spread indicates a higher perceived credit risk, as investors demand additional compensation for taking on that risk. Conversely, a lower z-spread suggests lower
credit risk
.
How Can the Z-Spread Help Bond Investors?
In bond portfolio management, the z-spread helps assess the relative value of different bonds. By comparing the z-spreads of various securities, investors can identify relatively undervalued or overvalued bonds, optimize the portfolio's risk-return profile, and make more informed decisions about buying or selling bonds to achieve their investment objectives.
How Does the Z-Spread Differ From the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)?
The Z-spread measures the spread over the Treasury yield curve without considering any
embedded options
in the bond, such as call or put options (e.g., a convertible bond, a callable bond, or a putable bond). If present, the option-adjusted spread (
OAS
) adjusts for these options, providing a more accurate reflection of the bond's true spread by accounting for the value of these options. Essentially, the OAS is the z-spread adjusted for option risk.
The Bottom Line
The z-spread is an important tool for assessing the relative value of bonds. It represents the constant spread that, when added to the Treasury spot rate at each cash flow point, equates the bond's price to the present value of its cash flows.

What Is P-Value?
A p-value, or probability value, is a number describing the likelihood of obtaining the observed data under the
null hypothesis
of a statistical test.
The p-value serves as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. A smaller p-value means stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
Key Takeaways
A p-value is a statistical measurement used to validate a hypothesis against observed data.
A p-value measures the probability of obtaining the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.
A p-value of 0.05 or lower is generally considered statistically significant.
P-value can serve as an alternative to—or in addition to—preselected confidence levels for hypothesis testing.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
What Is P-Value Used for?
P-value is often used to promote credibility for studies by scientists and medical researchers as well as reports by government agencies. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau stipulates that any analysis with a p-value greater than 0.10 must be accompanied by a statement that the difference is not statistically different from zero. The Census Bureau also has standards in place stipulating which p-values are acceptable for various publications.
1
How Is P-Value Calculated?
P-values are usually calculated using statistical software or p-value tables based on the assumed or known
probability distribution
of the specific statistic tested. While the sample size influences the reliability of the observed data, the p-value approach to hypothesis testing specifically involves calculating the p-value based on the deviation between the observed value and a chosen reference value, given the probability distribution of the statistic. A greater difference between the two values corresponds to a lower p-value.
Mathematically, the p-value is calculated using integral calculus from the area under the probability distribution curve for all values of statistics that are at least as far from the reference value as the observed value is, relative to the total area under the probability distribution curve. Standard deviations, which quantify the dispersion of data points from the mean, are instrumental in this calculation.

The calculation for a p-value varies based on the type of test performed. The three test types describe the location on the probability distribution curve: lower-tailed test, upper-tailed test, or
two-tailed test
. In each case, the degrees of freedom play a crucial role in determining the shape of the distribution and thus, the calculation of the p-value.
In a nutshell, the greater the difference between two observed values, the less likely it is that the difference is due to simple random chance, and this is reflected by a lower p-value.
What Is the Significance of a P-Value?
The p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This determination relies heavily on the test statistic, which summarizes the information from the sample relevant to the hypothesis being tested. The null hypothesis, also known as the conjecture, is the initial claim about a population (or data-generating process). The alternative hypothesis states whether the population parameter differs from the value of the population parameter stated in the conjecture.
In practice, the significance level is stated in advance to determine how small the p-value must be to reject the null hypothesis. Because different researchers use different levels of significance when examining a question, a reader may sometimes have difficulty comparing results from two different tests. P-values provide a solution to this problem.
Important
How to interpret p-value: Even a low p-value is not necessarily proof of statistical significance, since there is still a possibility that the observed data are the result of chance. Only repeated experiments or studies can confirm if a relationship is statistically significant.
For example, suppose a study comparing returns from two particular assets was undertaken by different researchers who used the same data but different significance levels. The researchers might come to opposite conclusions regarding whether the assets differ.
If one researcher used a confidence level of 90% and the other required a confidence level of 95% to reject the null hypothesis, and if the p-value of the observed difference between the two returns was 0.08 (corresponding to a confidence level of 92%), then the first researcher would find that the two assets have a difference that is
statistically significant
, while the second would find no statistically significant difference between the returns.
To avoid this problem, the researchers could report the p-value of the hypothesis test and allow readers to interpret the statistical significance themselves. This is called a p-value approach to hypothesis testing. Independent observers could note the p-value and decide for themselves whether that represents a statistically significant difference or not.
Example of P-Value
An investor claims that their investment portfolio’s performance is equivalent to that of the
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index
. To determine this, the investor conducts a two-tailed test.
The null hypothesis states that the portfolio’s returns are equivalent to the S&P 500’s returns over a specified period, while the alternative hypothesis states that the portfolio’s returns and the S&P 500’s returns are not equivalent—if the investor conducted a
one-tailed test
, the alternative hypothesis would state that the portfolio’s returns are either less than or greater than the S&P 500’s returns.
The p-value hypothesis test does not necessarily make use of a preselected confidence level at which the investor should reset the null hypothesis that the returns are equivalent. Instead, it provides a measure of how much evidence there is to reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis.
Thus, if the investor finds that the p-value is 0.001, there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis, and the investor can confidently conclude that the portfolio’s returns and the S&P 500’s returns are not equivalent.
Although this does not provide an exact threshold as to when the investor should accept or reject the null hypothesis, it does have another very practical advantage. P-value hypothesis testing offers a direct way to compare the relative confidence that the investor can have when choosing among multiple different types of investments or portfolios relative to a
benchmark
such as the S&P 500.
For example, for two portfolios, A and B, whose performance differs from the S&P 500 with p-values of 0.10 and 0.01, respectively, the investor can be much more confident that portfolio B, with a lower p-value, will actually show consistently different results.
Is a 0.05 P-Value Significant?
A p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered to be statistically significant, in which case the null hypothesis should be rejected. A p-value greater than 0.05 means that deviation from the null hypothesis is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.
What Does a P-Value of 0.001 Mean?
A p-value of 0.001 indicates that if the null hypothesis tested were indeed true, then there would be a one-in-1,000 chance of observing results at least as extreme. This leads the observer to reject the null hypothesis because either a highly rare data result has been observed or the null hypothesis is incorrect.
How Can You Use P-Value to Compare Two Different Results of a Hypothesis Test?
If you have two different results, one with a p-value of 0.04 and one with a p-value of 0.06, the result with a p-value of 0.04 will be considered more statistically significant than the p-value of 0.06. Beyond this simplified example, you could compare a 0.04 p-value to a 0.001 p-value. Both are statistically significant, but the 0.001 example provides an even stronger case against the null hypothesis than the 0.04.

Definition
A limited liability company (LLC) is a type of business structure that protects its owners from personal risk while offering the flexibility of a small business and the tax advantages of a partnership.
What Is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)?
A limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure in the U.S. that protects the assets of its owners from lawsuits and creditors concerned with the company's business debts.
Limited liability companies
are hybrid entities that combine the characteristics of a corporation with those of a partnership or sole proprietorship.
While the limited liability feature is similar to that of a corporation, the availability of pass-through taxation to the members of an LLC is a feature of a partnership rather than an LLC.
Key Takeaways
The limited liability company (LLC) is a corporate structure that protects its owners from being personally pursued for repayment of the company's debts or liabilities.
The regulation of LLCs varies from state to state.
Any entity or individual can be a member of an LLC, with the notable exceptions of banks and insurance companies.
LLCs do not pay taxes on their profits directly.
Their profits and losses are passed through to members, who report them on their individual tax returns.
Check your state's regulations before starting a Limited Liability Company.
Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
How a Limited Liability Company (LLC) Works
Limited liability companies are permitted under state statutes, and the regulations governing them vary from state to state. Generally, LLC owners are called members.
Many states don't restrict ownership, which means that anyone can be a member. That includes individuals, corporations, foreigners, foreign entities, and even other LLCs. Some entities, such as banks and insurance companies, are prohibited from forming LLCs.
1
An LLC is a formal business arrangement that requires
articles of organization
to be filed with the state. An LLC is easier
to set up
than a corporation; however, corporations provide more personal liability protection.
2
LLCs may elect not to pay federal taxes directly. Instead, their profits and losses can be reported on the personal tax returns of the owners. Or, the LLC may choose to be classified as a corporation for tax purposes.
3
If fraud is detected or if an LLC fails to meet its legal and reporting requirements, creditors may be able to go after the members.
LLCs should not be confused with an
unlimited liability corporation (ULC)
, which is a corporate structure allowed in certain countries and in some Canadian provinces.
Note
The wages paid to LLC members are deemed operating expenses and are deducted from the company's revenue.
Forming an LLC
1.
Although the requirements for LLCs vary by state, there are generally some commonalities. The very first thing owners or members must do is to choose a name.
2.
Then, articles of organization can be completed and filed with the state to
establish the LLC
. This document can provide basic information about the LLC, the names and addresses of the LLC members, the name of the LLC's registered agent, and the statement of purpose for the business.
The articles of organization are filed with the state in which the LLC is formed, along with a fee paid directly to the state. Paperwork and additional fees must also be submitted at the federal level to obtain an
employer identification number (EIN)
.
3.
An LLC
operating agreement
will lay out the operational and financial decision-making roles and duties of members. It will state just how profits are to be distributed.
It is the contract between all members of the LLC and provides all details about the LLC's structure and important business functions.
Normally, this internal document remains with the LLC and isn't distributed externally.
Note
A registered agent is a company that an LLC hires to manage the various legal and government correspondence sent to the LLC so that it can be sure to comply with state regulations.
Benefits of an LLC
An LLC provides its members with limited personal liability relating to the company's business debts.
It is fairly
easy to organize and get
up and running.
It offers the flexibility to opt for pass-through taxation or to elect corporate taxation (as an S Corporation or C Corporation).
Its pass-through taxation prevents double taxation—that is, paying taxes twice, once on LLC profits and then again on profits that individual members receive.
Many business expenses can be written off as business deductions, thus lowering taxable income; these deductions are taken on the LLC or personal return (depending on the taxation method chosen, corporate or pass-through).
An LLC can be run by its members, or members can hire a manager to handle day-to-day affairs. Some members may choose to be more or less involved than others.
The LLC designation can lend greater credibility to a sole proprietorship or partnership.
Less record-keeping is required compared to corporations, which means greater focus can be maintained on the goals of the business.
Drawbacks of an LLC
Depending on state law, an LLC may have to be dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member. A corporation can exist in perpetuity.
If the LLC opts for pass-through taxation, members must pay self-employment taxes in addition to personal income taxes.
Unless the operating agreement is properly conceived, executed, and understood by all, there's the risk that roles and responsibilities may not be clearly understood.
There can be penalties, as stated in the operating agreement, for failing to make capital contributions.
Important
An LLC may not be a suitable option if the founder's ultimate objective is to launch a publicly traded company.
LLC vs. Partnership
The primary difference between a partnership and an LLC is that an LLC separates the business assets of the company from the personal assets of the owners, insulating the owners from the LLC's debts and liabilities.
Both LLCs and partnerships are allowed to pass through their profits, along with the responsibility for paying the taxes on them, to their owners. Their losses can be used to offset other income, but only up to the amount invested by a member.
If the LLC has organized as a partnership, it must file
Form 1065
. (If members have elected to be treated as a corporation, Form 1120 is filed).
4
With an LLC, a business continuation agreement can be used to ensure the smooth transfer of interests when one of the owners leaves or dies. Without such an agreement in place, the remaining partners must dissolve the LLC and create a new one.
2
What Is a Limited Liability Company?
A limited liability company, commonly referred to as an LLC, is a type of business structure commonly used in the U.S. LLCs can be seen as a hybrid structure that combines
features of both a corporation and a partnership
. Like a corporation, LLCs provide their owners with limited liability in the event the business fails. But, like a partnership, LLCs pass their profits to members so that they are taxed as part of each member’s personal income.
2
What Are LLCs Used for?
The LLC has two main advantages:
It prevents its owners from being held personally responsible for the debts of the company. If the company goes bankrupt or is sued, the personal assets of its owner-investors cannot be pursued.
It allows all profits to be passed directly to those owners to be taxed as personal income. This prevents the double taxation of both the company and its individual owners.
2
What Are Some Examples of LLCs?
Examples of LLCs include The Wonderful Company LLC and Pilot Travel Centers LLC. LLCs can include
sole proprietorship LLCs
, family LLCs, and member-managed LLCs.
Many physicians' groups are registered as LLCs. This helps protect the individual doctors from personal liability for medical malpractice awards.
Are Limited Liability Companies Taxed Differently Than Corporations?
Yes. In the case of a corporation, profits are first taxed at the corporate level and then taxed a second time once those profits are distributed to the individual shareholders. This double taxation is decried by many businesses and investors.
Limited liability companies, on the other hand, allow the profits to be passed directly to the investors so that
they are taxed only once
, as part of the investors’ personal income.
2
The Bottom Line
LLCs are important legal structures for forming a business. Limited liability means that the as",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp

What Is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)?
A memorandum of understanding is an agreement between two or more parties outlined in a formal document. It is not necessarily legally binding, which depends on the signatories' intent and the language in the agreement, but signals the willingness of the parties to move forward with a contract.
The MOU can be seen as the starting point for negotiations as it defines the scope and purpose of the talks. Such memoranda are most often seen in international treaty negotiations but may also be used in high-stakes business dealings such as
merger
talks.
Key Takeaways
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a document that describes the broad outlines of an agreement that two or more parties have reached.
MOUs communicate the mutually accepted expectations of all of the parties involved in a negotiation.
While not necessarily legally binding, the MOU signals that a binding contract is imminent.
The MOU is most often found in international relations.
How a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Works
An MOU is an expression of agreement to proceed. It indicates that the parties have reached an understanding and are moving forward. Although it is not always legally binding, it is a serious declaration that a contract is imminent.
Under U.S. law, an MOU is similar to a
letter of intent
. In fact, arguably a memorandum of understanding, a memorandum of agreement, and a letter of intent are all similar documents. All communicate an agreement on a mutually beneficial goal and a desire to see it through to completion.
Note
Although an MOU is not necessarily legally binding, it allows parties to prepare for signing a contract by explaining the broad concepts and expectations of their agreement. Communicating in clear terms what each party hopes to gain from an agreement can be essential to the smooth execution of signing a legal contract in the future.
MOUs communicate the mutually accepted expectations of the people, organizations, or
governments
involved. They are most often used in international relations because, unlike
treaties
, they can be produced relatively quickly and in secret.
They are also used in many U.S. and state government agencies, particularly when major contracts are in the planning stages.
Contents of an MOU
An MOU clearly outlines specific points of understanding. It names the parties, describes the project on which they are agreeing, defines its scope, and details each party's roles and responsibilities.
While not always legally enforceable, an MOU is a significant step because of the time and effort involved in negotiating and drafting an effective document.
To
create an MOU
, the participating parties need to reach a mutual understanding. In the process, each side learns what is most important to the others before moving forward.
Important
An MOU communicates the mutually accepted expectations of the people, organizations, or governments involved.
The process often begins with each party effectively drafting its own best-case MOU. It considers its ideal or preferred outcome, what it believes it has to offer to the other parties, and what points may be non-negotiable on its side. This is each party's starting position for negotiations.
Advantages and Disadvantages of an MOU
A memorandum of understanding allows all parties to clearly state all of their objectives and goals. This makes for less uncertainty and prevents future unexpected
disputes
from occurring.
Furthermore, by clearly laying out what each party expects of the other, an MOU provides a blueprint for any contract both parties may or may not wish to draw up in the future.
The biggest drawback of an MOU, depending on your point of view, is that it is not necessarily legally binding.
While in some cases this may be a benefit, since neither party is required to do what they say in the MOU, they can simply walk away or change their expectations. Of course, this all depends on the intent and legal language of the MOU.
MOUs can take significant time and planning to create and if one party completely changes its requirements, creating the MOU would be a large waste of resources.
Is an MOU Legally Binding?
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a legal document but it is not necessarily legally binding, although it usually signals a contract is imminent. The specific intent and language of the agreement will determine whether it is actually binding or not.
What Is the Difference Between an MOU and an MOA?
An MOU is a document that describes very broad concepts of mutual understanding, goals, and plans shared by the parties. In contrast, an MOA (memorandum of agreement) is a document describing in detail the specific responsibilities of, and actions to be taken by, each of the parties so that their goals may be accomplished.
How Do You Write an MOU?
Usually, a lawyer will draft an MOU. An MOU should clearly state the following: what parties are involved, the context of the agreement, the proposed date of when the agreement will become effective, the contact details of all relevant parties, the broad purpose of the agreement, and what each party is hoping to achieve, as well as a space for all necessary signatures.
Why Is an MOU Important?
An MOU is important because it allows each party to clearly state their objectives and what they expect from one another. Drafting an MOU can help solve any disputes before each party enters into a full, legally binding contract.
The Bottom Line
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a starting point of negotiations between multiple parties to signal the intent of doing business or coming to an agreement. It simplifies a legal contract by establishing the key objectives and goals.

Investopedia,"Third World Countries: Definition, Criteria, and List of Countries","Close
What Is the Third World?
Certain nations were categorized as Third World countries in the last half of the 20th century. This is now considered an outdated and derogatory phrase used to describe nations that were economically underdeveloped and had little or no affiliation with major world powers.
The Third World countries occupied one of four segments that identified nations by their relative economic standing. Roughly, the major world powers and their economic and political allies were First World countries, allies of the Soviet Union were Second World countries, underdeveloped nations were Third World countries, and nations that were entirely isolated from global politics and economics were the Fourth World.
Today, the preferred terminology categorizes a nation as a developing country, an underdeveloped country, or a low- and
middle-income country (LMIC)
.
Key Takeaways
""Third World"" is an outdated and offensive Cold War-era term.
Currently accepted terms include ""developing"" and ""lower-middle or low-income."" The poorest and least industrialized nations are sometimes termed ""frontier"" or ""least developed"" countries.
Whatever the terminology, the terms are intended to characterize a nation's place in the global economy.
Defining Developing Nations
Classifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept that was created soon after the end of World War II in 1945 and used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Nations are often characterized by their economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, lack of sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living.
Developing nations are closely watched by the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the
World Bank
, which provide grants and loans that help struggling nations improve their infrastructure and economic systems.
1
Both organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries.
Developing nations, or LMICs, are of particular interest to investors seeking to identify growth opportunities. Both their risks and their returns are relatively high. Developing countries are generally characterized as economic underperformers, but innovation and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time.
History of Developing Nations Classifications
The classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during the Cold War. First-world countries were known as highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
capitalism
.
Second-world countries had
communist
systems and most were allied with the Soviet Union. These included the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe and some Asia nations.
Third-world countries included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union.
Now, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive.
Alfred Sauvy Coined the Term
Alfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy observed a group of countries, many of them former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism.
""Three worlds, one planet,"" wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published in
L'Observateur
.
2
Dividing the World
Most nations today fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The former world segmentations have been fit into these categories for the most part.
The developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economic indicators.
Frontier Markets List
MSCI’s Frontier Markets Index can serve as a list of developing countries.
3
The index includes the following countries:
Croatia
Estonia
Iceland
Lithuania
Kazakhstan
Romania
Serbia
Slovenia
Kenya
Mauritius
Morocco
Nigeria
Tunisia
WAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union)
Bahrain
Jordan
Oman
Bangladesh
Pakistan
Sri Lanka
Vietnam
4
Other Definitions of Developing Nations
The World Trade Organization provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though their statuses can be contested by other nations.
5
Each WTO segregation comes with certain opportunities for the nations. WTO projects are designed to increase trading opportunities and improve infrastructure.
The Least Developed Countries List
As an offshoot of the WTO, the
Human Development Index
(HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries. The HDI measures and then ranks a country based on education, life expectancy, and gross national income per capita.
The World Health Organization and the United Nations use Least Developed Countries (LDC) to describe a set of 48 countries with low socioeconomic developmental indicators. This list is reassessed every few years.
The indicators are a combination of gross national income, human assets (nutrition, life expectancy, secondary school education, adult literacy), and economic vulnerability (population size, remoteness, merchandise export concentration, agriculture, exports, and natural disaster preparedness).

What Is the Third World?
The phrase Third World was used to characterize nations that existed outside the economic and political ties that bind the industrialized countries around the world. Many are former colonies of European nations.
The term Third World is today considered pejorative. A nation might now be considered developing or frontier. A developing nation is intent on improving the infrastructure, education system, health system, and trade ties that are necessary to improve living standards. A frontier nation might be just beginning that process.
There also are the nations that the United Nations terms the ""least developed."" Formerly termed the Fourth World nations, they remain isolated from the rest of the world's economic systems, technology, and politics.
What Is the First World?
The term First World collectively means the highly industrialized nations with capitalist economies. Although the term is largely outdated, the list of First World nations today would include Japan as well as the nations of North America and Western Europe. It might arguably also include some Eastern European, South American, and Asian nations.
What Is a Frontier Nation?
The term frontier nation is used primarily by investment professionals who specialize in international investing. It describes a nation that seems poised for fast economic development. Investments in these countries is seen as offering potentially high rewards at substantially high risk.
The Bottom Line
The term Third World was coined in a very different time. In the wake of World War II, it seemed reasonable to classify nations as capitalist powers (the First World), communist countries (the Second World), and countries that are neither (the Third World).
Current classifications will probably seem equally outdated in 70 years. But for now, there are developed nations, developing nations, and underdeveloped nations.

Definition
Quantitative analysis (QA) is a financial method that uses mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze data and inform investment or trading decisions.
Quantitative analysis (QA) refers to methods used to understand the behavior of financial markets and make more informed investment or trading decisions. It involves the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze financial data.
1
For instance, by examining past stock prices, earnings reports, and other information, quantitative analysts, often called “
quants
,” aim to forecast where the market is headed.
2
Unlike fundamental analysis that might focus on a company's management team or industry conditions, quantitative analysis relies chiefly on crunching numbers and complex computations to derive actionable insights.
Quantitative analysis can be a powerful tool, especially in modern markets where data is abundant and computational tools are advanced, enabling a more precise examination of the financial landscape. However, many also believe that the raw numbers produced by quantitative analysis should be combined with the more in-depth understanding and nuance afforded by
qualitative analysis
.
Key Takeaways
Quantitative analysis (QA) is a set of techniques that use mathematical and statistical modeling, measurement, and research to understand behavior.
Quantitative analysis presents financial information in terms of a numerical value.
It's used for the evaluation of financial instruments and for predicting real-world events such as changes in GDP.
While powerful, quantitative analysis has some drawbacks that can be supplemented with qualitative analysis.
Understanding Quantitative Analysis
Quantitative analysis (QA) in finance refers to the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze financial & economic data and make trading, investing, and risk management decisions.
QA starts with data collection, where quants gather a vast amount of financial data that might affect the market. This data can include anything from stock prices and company earnings to economic indicators like inflation or unemployment rates. They then use various mathematical models and statistical techniques to analyze this data, looking for trends, patterns, and potential investment opportunities. The outcome of this analysis can help investors decide where to allocate their resources to maximize returns or minimize risks.
Some key aspects of quantitative analysis in finance include:
1
Statistical analysis
- this aspect of quantitative analysis involves examining data to identify trends and relationships, build predictive models, and make forecasts. Techniques used can include
regression analysis
, which helps in understanding relationships between variables;
time series analysis
, which looks at data points collected or recorded at a specific time; and
Monte Carlo simulations
, a mathematical technique that allows you to account for uncertainty in your analyses and forecasts. Through statistical analysis, quants can uncover insights that may not be immediately apparent, helping investors and financial analysts make more informed decisions.
Algorithmic trading
- this entails using computer algorithms to automate the trading process. Algorithms can be programmed to carry out trades based on a variety of factors such as timing, price movements, liquidity changes, and other market signals.
High-frequency trading
(HFT), a type of algorithmic trading, involves making a large number of trades within fractions of a second to capitalize on small price movements. This automated approach to trading can lead to more efficient and often profitable trading strategies.
Risk modeling
- risk is an inherent part of financial markets. Risk modeling involves creating mathematical models to measure and quantify various risk exposures within a portfolio. Methods used in risk modeling include
Value-at-Risk
(VaR) models,
scenario analysis
, and
stress testing
.
3
These tools help in understanding the potential downside and uncertainties associated with different investment scenarios, aiding in better risk management and mitigation strategies.
Derivatives pricing
-
derivatives
are financial contracts whose value is derived from other underlying assets like stocks or bonds. Derivatives pricing involves creating mathematical models to evaluate these contracts and determine their fair prices and risk profiles. A well-known model used in this domain is the
Black-Scholes model
, which helps in pricing
options contracts
.
4
Accurate derivatives pricing is crucial for investors and traders to make sound financial decisions regarding buying, selling, or hedging with derivatives.
Portfolio optimization
- This is about constructing a portfolio in such a way that it yields the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk. Techniques like
Modern Portfolio Theory
(MPT) are employed to find the optimal allocation of assets within a portfolio.
5
By analyzing various asset classes and their expected returns, risks, and correlations, quants can suggest the best mix of investments to achieve specific financial goals while minimizing risk.
The overall goal is to use data, math, statistics, and software to make more informed financial decisions, automate processes, and ultimately generate greater risk-adjusted returns.
Important
Quantitative analysis is widely used in central banking, algorithmic trading, hedge fund management, and investment banking activities. Quantitative analysts, employ advanced skills in programming, statistics, calculus, linear algebra etc. to execute quantitative analysis.
Quantitative Analysis vs. Qualitative Analysis
Quantitative analysis relies heavily on numerical data and mathematical models to make decisions regarding investments and financial strategies. It focuses on the measurable, objective data that can be gathered about a company or a financial instrument.
But analysts also evaluate information that is not easily quantifiable or reduced to numeric values to get a better picture of a company's performance. This important qualitative data can include reputation, regulatory insights, or employee morale. Qualitative analysis thus focuses more on understanding the underlying qualities of a company or a financial instrument, which may not be immediately quantifiable.
Quantitative isn't the opposite of qualitative analysis. They're different and often complementary philosophies. They each provide useful information for informed decisions. When used together. better decisions can be made than using either one in isolation.
Some common uses of qualitative analysis include:
6
Management Evaluation:
Qualitative analysis is often better at evaluating a company's management team, their experience, and their ability to lead the company toward growth. While quantifiable metrics are useful, they often cannot capture the full picture of management's ability and potential. For example, the leadership skills, vision, and corporate culture instilled by management are intangible factors that can significantly impact a company's success, yet are difficult to measure with numbers alone.
Industry Analysis:
It also includes an analysis of the industry in which the company operates, the competition, and market conditions. For instance, it can explore how changes in technology or societal behaviors could impact the industry. Qualitative approaches can also better identify barriers to entry or exit, which can affect the level of competition and profitability within the industry.
Brand Value and Company Reputation:
The reputation of a company, its brand value, and customer loyalty are also significant factors considered in qualitative analysis. Understanding how consumers perceive the brand, their level of trust, and satisfaction can provide insights into customer loyalty and the potential for sustained revenue. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or interviews.
Regulatory Environment:
The regulatory environment, potential legal issues, and other external factors that could impact a company are also analyzed qualitatively. Evaluating a company's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards to ascertain its legal standing and the potential risk of legal issues. In addition, understanding a company's ethical practices and social responsibility initiatives, that can influence its relationship with stakeholders and the community at large.

Definition
A yield curve is a graphical representation of yields over time; it is often depicted by plotting the yield of any given bond across different maturities in a given interval, perhaps by month.
What Is a Yield Curve?
A yield curve is a line that plots the yields or interest rates of bonds that have equal credit quality but different
maturity dates
. The slope of the yield curve predicts the direction of interest rates and the economic expansion or contraction that could result. Yield curve rates are published on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website each trading day.
Key Takeaways
Yield curves plot the interest rates of bonds over time.
Very generally speaking, interest rates/yields should be higher in the long run (when risk is highest).
Normal curves point to economic expansion, while downward-sloping curves suggest economic recession.
Yield curve rates are published on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website each trading day.
Using a Yield Curve
A
yield curve is a benchmark
for other debts in the market such as mortgage rates and bank lending rates. The yield curve can predict changes in economic output and growth over time.
The most frequently reported yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt.
Yield curve rates
are available on the Treasury's interest rate websites by 6:00 p.m. ET each trading day.
1
2
Some investors use the yield curve to make investment decisions based on the likely direction of bond rates. A visual representation of the curve is easy to build using an
Excel spreadsheet
.
Types of Yield Curves
The three types of yield curves include normal, inverted, and flat.

Normal Yield Curve
A normal yield curve shows low yields for shorter-maturity bonds increasing for bonds with a longer maturity. The curve slopes upward. This indicates that yields on longer-term bonds continue to rise, responding to periods of
economic expansion
.
Fast Fact
A normal yield curve implies stable economic conditions and a normal
economic cycle
. A steep yield curve implies strong economic growth with conditions often accompanied by higher inflation and higher interest rates.
Sample yields on the curve can include a two-year bond that offers a yield of 1%, a five-year bond that offers a yield of 1.8%, a 10-year bond that offers a yield of 2.5%, a 15-year bond offers a yield of 3.0%, and a 20-year bond that offers a yield of 3.5%.
Some bond investors will use a
roll-down return strategy
and sell a bond as it moves toward its maturity date. This strategy is also known as
riding the curve
. It works in a stable rate environment as the bond's yield falls and the price rises. Investors hope to capture profit from the rise in bond prices.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Inverted Yield Curve
An inverted yield curve slopes downward with short-term interest rates exceeding long-term rates. This type of curve corresponds to a period of economic recession when investors expect yields on longer-maturity bonds to trend lower in the future.
3
Investors seeking safe investments in an economic downturn tend to choose longer-dated bonds over short-dated bonds, bidding up the price of longer bonds and driving down their yield.
Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019
Important
An
inverted yield curve
is rare. It's historically been a warning of recession.
3
Flat Yield Curve
A flat yield curve shows similar yields across all maturities, implying an uncertain economic situation. A few intermediate maturities may have slightly higher yields that cause a slight hump to appear along the flat curve. These humps are usually for mid-term maturities of six months to two years.
The curve shows little difference in yield to maturity among shorter and longer-term bonds. A two-year bond may offer a yield of 6%, a five-year bond of 6.1%, a 10-year bond of 6%, and a 20-year bond of 6.05%.
In times of high uncertainty, investors demand similar yields across all maturities.
What Is a U.S. Treasury Yield Curve?
The U.S. Treasury yield curve is a line chart that allows for the comparison of the yields of short-term
Treasury bills
and the yields of long-term Treasury notes and bonds. The chart shows the relationship between the interest rates and the maturities of U.S. Treasury fixed-income securities.
The Treasury yield curve is also referred to as the term structure of interest rates.
What Is Yield Curve Risk?
Yield curve risk refers to the adverse effect of a shift in interest rates on the returns from fixed-income instruments such as bonds. It stems from the fact that bond prices and interest rates have an
inverse relationship
to each other. The prices of bonds in the secondary market decrease when market interest rates increase and vice versa.
How Can Investors Use the Yield Curve?
Investors can use the yield curve to
make predictions
about the economy that will affect their investment decisions.
An investor might move their money into defensive assets that traditionally do well during a recession if the bond yield curve indicates an economic slowdown. They might avoid long-term bonds with a yield that will erode against increased prices if the yield curve becomes steep, suggesting future inflation.
The Bottom Line
Yield curves come in three main shapes: a normal upward-sloping curve, an inverted downward-sloping curve, and a flat curve. The slope of the yield curve predicts interest rate changes and economic activity. Investors can use the yield curve to make investment decisions that factor in the likely direction of the economy in the near future.

Definition
Social responsibility is the principle that individuals and corporations should operate in a way that has a positive impact on society and the world.
What Is Social Responsibility?
Social responsibility is an ethical focus for individuals and companies that want to take action and be accountable for practices that benefit society. It has become increasingly important to investors and consumers who want to put their money into or purchase products from companies that take steps to contribute to the welfare of society and the environment.
Critics have traditionally argued that the basic nature of business doesn’t consider society to be a
stakeholder
, but many investors and consumers are embracing social responsibility and driving change.
Key Takeaways
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) means that businesses should operate in ways that benefit society in addition to maximizing shareholder value.
Socially responsible companies adopt policies that promote the well-being of society and the environment while lessening the negative impacts on them.
Companies can act responsibly in many ways such as by promoting volunteering, making changes that benefit the environment, engaging in ethical labor practices, and engaging in charitable giving.
Consumers are more actively looking to buy goods and services from socially responsible companies, and this impacts their profitability.
Critics assert that practicing and endorsing CSR standards contradicts the purpose of a business, which is to make money.
Social responsibility can lead to positive brand perception and customer retention.
Michela Buttignol / Investopedia
Understanding Social Responsibility
Social responsibility requires that individuals and companies act in the best interests of the environment and society as a whole. Social responsibility is referred to as
corporate social responsibility (CSR)
when it applies to businesses, and it’s becoming more popular due to shifting social norms. Many companies have made CSR an integral part of their
business models
without compromising profitability.
A Massachusetts Institute of Technology meta-analysis of 200 surveys over 20 years talked with business leaders in more than 70 countries, and there was a high level of interest in the topic. The report called CSR a “halo strategy” and concluded that “by presenting themselves as true believers in CSR (saints), businesses seek to improve the overall corporate image (the halo) and expect broad benefits from diverse stakeholders to follow (the warm glow).”
1
The crux of CSR is to enact policies that promote an ethical balance between the dual mandates of striving for profitability and benefiting society as a whole. These policies can be enacted by commission such as through donations of money, time, or resources, or by omission practices such as by “going green,” reducing greenhouse gases, or abiding by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations to limit pollution.
More
consciously capitalistic investors
and consumers are considering a company’s commitment to CSR practices
before making an investment
or purchase. Embracing CSR can benefit the prime directive: maximization of shareholder value.
2
Actions or the lack of them will affect future generations. CSR is good business practice, and a failure to execute it can hurt the
balance sheet
. It can boost company morale, especially when a company can motivate its employees through social causes.
Important
CSR is generally more effective when a company takes it on voluntarily rather than waiting for the government to require it through regulation.
Areas of Focus
The
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
emphasizes that a business’s ability to maintain a balance between pursuing economic performance and adhering to societal and environmental issues is a critical factor in operating efficiently and effectively.
3
4
A company can embrace CSR through philanthropy, by promoting volunteering, and by committing to ethical labor practices and environmental changes.
Companies that manage their environmental impact might look to reduce their carbon footprint and limit waste. There’s also a responsibility to treat employees ethically, such as by offering a fair wage even when there are limited employee protection laws.
Examples of Socially Responsible Corporations
CSR takes on different meanings within certain industries and companies:
Starbucks Corp. (
SBUX
) has committed to CSR from the start, including sustainability and community welfare. It purchases Fair Trade Certified ingredients to manufacture products, and it actively supports sustainable farming in the regions where ingredients are sourced.
5
6
Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Holdings Inc. has integrated CSR into the core of its operations. Like Starbucks, the company purchases Fair Trade Certified ingredients.
7
8
Salesforce.com Inc. (
CRM
) developed what it calls the “1-1-1 model.” The company dedicates 1% of its equity, 1% of its product, and 1% of its employees’ time back to the community.
9
Big-box retailer Target Corp. (
TGT
) is also well known for its social responsibility programs. It has donated money to communities in which the stores operate, including education grants.
10
11
Criticism of Corporate Social Responsibility
Not everyone believes that businesses should have a social conscience. Economist
Milton Friedman
stated that the “‘social responsibilities of business’ are notable for their analytical looseness and lack of rigor.” Friedman believed that only individuals can have a sense of social responsibility. By their very nature, businesses cannot. Some experts believe that CSR defies the very point of being in business: profit above all else.
12
A conservative backlash to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies has appeared, and this can affect employment initiatives that are part of CSR. Florida banned the practice in state-funded colleges in May 2023 under the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
13
Phil Lyman, a state representative from Utah, even blamed the catastrophic collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge on DEI.
14
The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania noted in its house journal, Knowledge at Wharton, that “DEI is under attack.” It started “the Relationships Across Differences Roundtable (RADs), a coalition of more than 70 academics and industry leaders committed to advancing inclusivity in all its forms—race, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, neurodiversity, and age. They are partnering to share science-backed insights and best practices, strategize on common problems, and find ways to engage all stakeholders, even the ones who don’t believe in DEI.”
15
Some CSR policies continue to join the mainstream despite such opposition, and they’re practiced among a wide range of companies. Generations such as
millennials
and
Gen Z
are embracing it and driving change in the workplace and as consumers.
16
What Are Some Examples of Social Responsibility?
CSR includes companies engaging in environmental preservation efforts, ethical labor practices, philanthropy, and promoting volunteering. A company might change its manufacturing process to reduce carbon emissions.
What Are the Main Benefits of Social Responsibility?
Benefiting society and lessening the negative impacts on the environment are among the main benefits and goals of CSR. Consumers are increasingly looking to buy goods and services from socially responsible companies, and this can have a positive impact on their
bottom lines
.
How Does Social Responsibility Benefit Companies?
Companies that implement social responsibility programs can potentially increase their bottom lines and boost their
brand image
as well. Social responsibility programs can also have a positive impact on morale among employees.
The Bottom Line
Companies engaging in CSR benefit the common good in several ways, including making changes that support the environment, engaging in ethical labor practices, and promoting volunteering and philanthropy. The practice can also be said to benefit their bottom lines because consumers are more actively looking to do business with
socially responsible companies

The accounts receivables turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company collects payment from its customers.
What Is the Receivables Turnover Ratio?
The receivables turnover ratio measures how many times a company successfully collects its average
accounts receivable
balance over a certain period (usually a year). This ratio helps companies monitor cash flow by quantifying the effectiveness of their payment collection efforts.
Key Takeaways
The receivables turnover ratio measures how often a company is collecting its accounts receivable balance from customers over a certain time period.
Companies use this ratio to measure how often they’re converting outstanding customer credit into cash.
A high ratio suggests effective collection, while a low ratio indicates potential issues with credit collection.
Investopedia / Zoe Hansen
Understanding Receivables Turnover Ratios
To calculate the receivables turnover ratio, a company needs to divide its
net credit sales
by its average accounts receivable. This gives an estimate of how often a company collects its receivables. This ratio is usually calculated on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, and it can be used to help companies measure current
cash flow
trends and identify opportunities for improvement.
Understanding The Components of the Receivables Turnover Ratio
Two essential elements are needed to calculate the receivables turnover ratio: net credit sales and average accounts receivable.
Accounts Receivable Turnover.
WallStreetMojo
Net Credit Sales
Net credit sales refers to how much
revenue
a company earns, specifically revenue paid as credit. The sale must incur an accounts receivable balance in order to be considered a “net credit sale,” meaning cash sales aren’t included.
1
To calculate net credit sales, a business takes its gross credit sales (the volume of all sales incurring an accounts receivable balance) and subtracts customer returns or discounts. This is important, because businesses will need to calculate the net credit sales during a specific period of time, often a month or quarter. If a customer returns an item outside of that period (say the following month), the return will still need to be applied to the net credit sales calculation.

For example, if Joe’s Bakery made $50,000 in gross credit sales during one month and received $1,000 in returns (even if some of those returns happened in the following month). Their net credit sales would be $49,000.
Average Accounts Receivable
To calculate the ratio, you’ll need to know the balance of your average accounts receivable. In other words, how much do you generally maintain in outstanding customer payments? Companies can determine this amount by calculating the difference between starting accounting receivables balances and ending balances.
Depending on the company’s
accounting software
, this information may be automatically calculated and presented—sometimes on a daily basis. It will be important to ensure the only data included in the ratio coincides with a specific time period (such as one month or quarter).
For example, if Joe’s Bakery has an accounts receivable balance of $5,000 at the start of the month and $10,000 at the end of the month, the company would add the two balances together and divide by two to find the average accounts receivable for the month:
Average accounts receivable: ($5,000 + $10,000) / 2 = $7,500
Example of Receivables Turnover Ratio
Company A has net credit sales of $1,000,000 for the year. On January 1, their starting accounts receivable balance was $70,000. On December 31, their ending accounts receivable balance was $85,000.
First, calculate the average accounts receivable:
($70,000 + $85,000) / 2 = $77,500
Next, let’s use the information above to determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio:
$1,000,000 in net credit sales / $77,000 in average accounts receivable = 12.98
Based on the data provided during this time period, Company A collects its accounts receivables and converts that credit to cash 12.98 times on average per year.
More specifically, we can deduce:
365 days per year / 12.98 = The average duration of accounts receivable is approximately 28 days.
If Company A has a net 30-day payment policy, a 28-day turnover ratio indicates that customers are paying about two days early on average.
Company A can use this information to justify its customer credit structure or payment policy, as it indicates their current processes are generally effective.
How the Receivables Turnover Ratio Correlates with Cash Flow
The time between the sale of a product or service and payment can impact
cash flow
. Unless all outstanding costs are owed upfront (ex., a cash sale at a grocery store or clothing store), a business is essentially loaning customers the funds owed until it’s time to collect.
It’s not unusual for businesses to give clients 30 days or longer to pay for a product or service. That’s the time during which the business could be reinvesting in itself,
paying down debts
, or otherwise addressing its own financial obligations.
The receivables turnover ratio can help a company understand its existing cash flow trend. The higher the ratio, the more efficient the company is at collecting outstanding account balances. The lower the ratio, the more inefficient they may be—meaning the company converts its accounts receivable to cash less often.
By tracking the receivables turnover ratio, businesses can gain insight into their collection efficiency and take actions to improve cash flow, such as adjusting customer payment terms or improving credit collection strategies.
Advantages and Disadvantages of the Receivables Turnover Ratio
While the receivables turnover ratio can help companies conduct internal comparisons to previous periods, it may be difficult to compare ratios across the industry.
Advantages
Provides clear insights into the efficiency of a company’s credit and collections process.
Helps monitor cash flow and identify opportunities for improving collection practices.
Useful for internal benchmarking over time.
Disadvantages
Difficult to compare across industries due to varying standards and customer credit policies.
Seasonal fluctuations can impact the ratio, requiring analysis over longer periods (e.g., 12 months).
Companies may inflate their ratio by using total sales numbers instead of net sales when calculating.
Not all companies disclose net sales information, making it harder to get accurate comparisons.
Receivables Turnover Ratio vs. Asset Turnover Ratio
The receivables turnover ratio measures a company’s ability to effectively collect outstanding payments from customers. The asset turnover ratio, however, measures how effectively a company is able to use its assets to generate revenue. In both cases, the higher the ratio, the more efficiently the company is operating.
What Does a High Receivables Turnover Ratio Mean?
The higher a company’s accounts receivable turnover ratio, the more frequently they convert customer credit into cash. This is an indication that the company is operating efficiently and its customers are willing and able to pay their outstanding balances in a timely manner.
A high ratio can also indicate that the company has relatively conservative lending practices for its customers. While this leads to greater control over cash flow, it has the potential to alienate customers who require longer payback periods.
What Does a Low Receivables Turnover Ratio Mean?
When a company’s receivables turnover ratio is low, this indicates they have an issue with collecting outstanding customer credit and converting it into cash. The lower the ratio, the less frequently the company is collecting payments, indicating a potential cash flow problem.
A low ratio could also be an indication that there’s a problem with production or product delivery—if customers aren’t receiving their products on time, they aren’t going to pay on time either.
Why Is the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio Important?
The receivables turnover ratio is one metric a company can use to glean information about customer habits and internal payment collection practices. When this data is collected, measured, and compared over time, it can help a company identify ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/receivableturnoverratio.asp

A venture capitalist is a private equity investor who provides capital to companies with a high potential for growth in exchange for an equity stake.
What Is a Venture Capitalist?
A venture capitalist (VC) is an investor who funds companies with high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake in their eventual success. Most VC money goes to startup ventures preparing to go public or small privately owned companies with the potential to expand.
Venture capital companies attract investment money from high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), insurance companies, pension funds, foundations, and corporate pension funds.
Key Takeaways
A venture capitalist (VC) is an investor or investment partnership that provides young companies with capital in exchange for equity.
Startups turn to VCs for funding to scale up their businesses.
Venture capitalists tend to experience high rates of failure but win massive returns for their rare successes.
Joules Garcia / Investopedia
Understanding Venture Capitalists
Venture capital firms are usually formed as limited partnerships (LPs), with each partner contributing to the VC fund. A committee is generally tasked with making investment decisions. When a promising emerging growth company is identified, the firm agrees to fund it in exchange for a sizable equity stake.
Contrary to common belief, VCs do not typically fund a startup in its earliest planning stages. They target firms that have a product and are generating revenue but need more money to commercialize their ideas.
The VC fund will buy a stake in these firms, nurture their growth, and look to cash out with a strong
return on investment
.

What Venture Capitalists Look For
Venture capitalists typically look for companies with a strong management team, a large potential market, and a distinctive product or service with a solid competitive advantage.
They tend to look for prospects in industries with which they are familiar or have expertise while having the chance to buy a large percentage of the company so they can influence its direction.
VCs are willing to risk investing in such companies because they can earn a massive return on their investments if they are successful. However, VCs have high rates of failure because of the uncertainty involved with new and unproven companies.
Below are the company stages and a chart of recent VC funding in U.S. companies.

Venture capitalists can be involved in any of these stages, but are usually focused on the startup and growth stages, as we can see from the chart below of recent U.S. VC funding.
Venture Capital Structure
High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), insurance companies,
pension funds
, foundations, and corporate pension funds may contribute money to a pool controlled by a VC firm. The venture capital firm acts as the general partner, managing the funds and choosing the investments, while the investors are limited partners (LPs). All partners have part ownership of the fund.
The roles within a venture capital firm vary, but they can be broken down into roughly three positions:
Associates
: These individuals usually come to VC firms with experience in either business consulting or finance. They may analyze business models, industry trends, and sectors. They also work on a firm’s portfolio. Although they do not make critical decisions, associates may introduce promising companies to the firm’s upper management.
Principals
: A principal is a midlevel professional. They usually serve on the boards of portfolio companies and ensure that they run without significant hiccups. Principals are responsible for identifying prospects for VC firms and negotiating terms for acquisition and exit. Principals are on a partner track that depends on the returns they generate.
Partners
: Higher-profile partners primarily identify areas or specific businesses to invest in, approve deals (whether investments or exits), occasionally sit on the board of portfolio companies, and represent their VC firms.
Important
VC firms control a pool of various investors’ money, unlike
angel investors
, who use their own money.
Venture capitalists must follow regulations
in conducting their business. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates private-equity firms and venture capitalists.
1
Venture capital fund managers are paid management fees and
carried interest
. Depending on the firm, about 20% of the profits are paid to the company managing the private equity fund, while the rest goes to the LPs invested in the fund. General partners are usually due an additional 2% fee.
History of Venture Capital
The history of investing in high-risk and high-reward ventures is centuries old. It's hard to imagine the history of shipping, whaling, and colonialism without it.
2
However, the first modern venture capital firms in the United States started in the mid-20th century. Georges Doriot, a Frenchman who moved to the U.S. to earn a business degree, became an instructor at Harvard Business School and worked at an investment bank. In 1946, he became president of the American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC), the first publicly funded venture capital firm.
3
Before, founders of new companies generally looked to wealthy individuals like the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts for the capital they needed to grow. ARDC expanded the pool of investors. It soon had millions in its accounts from educational institutions and insurers.
ARDC alums founded firms such as Morgan Holland Ventures and Greylock Partners.
4
Fast Fact
The VC firm serves as the general partner (GP), deciding where the money is invested. They tend to choose businesses or ventures that banks avoid due to their high degree of risk.
Startup financing began to resemble the modern-day venture capital industry after the passage of the Investment Act of 1958.
5
The act enabled
small business investment companies
to be licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which had been established five years earlier.
6
By its nature, venture capital invests in new businesses with excellent growth potential but enough risk to be rejected by banks with conservative requirements for extending loans.
Early Ventures
Fairchild Semiconductor, one of the earliest and most successful semiconductor companies, was the first venture capital-backed startup, setting a pattern for venture capital’s close relationship with emerging technologies in the San Francisco area.
7
8
Venture capital firms in that region and period established the standard practices that are still used today. They set up limited partnerships to hold investments, with professionals acting as general partners. Those supplying the capital serve as passive partners with more limited control.
The number of independent venture capital firms increased in the following decade, prompting the founding of the National Venture Capital Association in 1973.
9
10
Venture capital has since grown into a hundred-billion-dollar industry.
11
Today, well-known venture capitalists include Jim Breyer, an early Facebook (

).

VC Expected Returns on a Deal
Venture capitalists invest in startups with the expectation of making a significant return on their investment. The structure of the expected return is based on the high risk associated with investing in early-stage companies and the potential for high rewards if the startup succeeds.

Qualitative analysis explores a company’s nonnumerical data, helping it understand its value or prospects.
What Is Qualitative Analysis?
In business and management, qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to analyze a company’s value or prospects based on nonquantifiable information, such as management expertise, industry cycles, strength of research and development, and labor relations.
Qualitative analysis contrasts with
quantitative analysis
, which focuses on numbers found in reports such as balance sheets. The two techniques, however, will often be used together to examine a company’s operations and evaluate its potential as an investment opportunity.
Key Takeaways
Qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment based on “soft” or nonquantifiable data.
Qualitative analysis deals with intangible and inexact information that can be difficult to collect and measure.
Machines struggle to conduct qualitative analysis, as intangibles can’t be defined by numeric values.
Understanding people and company cultures is central to qualitative analysis.
Looking at a company through the eyes of a customer and understanding its competitive advantage both assist with qualitative analysis.
Qualitative analysis can be conducted by anthropologists. sociologists, and researchers in applied fields like education or public health.
Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia
Understanding Qualitative Analysis
The distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches is similar to the difference between human and artificial intelligence. Quantitative analysis uses exact inputs such as profit margins,
debt ratios
, earnings multiples, and the like. These can be plugged into a computerized model to yield an exact result, such as the
fair value
of a stock or a forecast for earnings growth. Of course, for the time being, a human has to write the program that crunches these numbers, and that involves a fair degree of subjective judgment. Once they are programmed, though, computers can perform quantitative analysis in fractions of a second, while it might take even the most gifted and highly trained humans minutes or hours.
Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, deals with intangible, inexact concerns that belong to the social and experiential realm rather than the mathematical one. This approach depends on the kind of intelligence that machines currently lack, since things like positive associations with a brand, management trustworthiness, customer satisfaction,
competitive advantage
, and cultural shifts are difficult, arguably impossible, to capture with numerical inputs.
Fast Fact
Many
social scientists
use qualitative analysis in their research, and it is especially prominent among anthropologists and sociologists.
Understanding People Through Qualitative Analysis
Qualitative analysis may sound almost like “listening to your gut,” and indeed, many qualitative analysts would argue that gut feelings have their place in the process. This does not mean, however, that it is not a rigorous approach. Indeed, it can consume much more time and energy than quantitative analysis.
People are central to qualitative analysis. An investor might start by getting to know a
company’s management
, including their educational and professional backgrounds. One of the most important factors is their experience in the industry. More abstractly, do they have a record of hard work and prudent decision making, or are they better at knowing—or being related to—the right people? Their reputations are also key: Do their colleagues and peers respect them? Their relationships with business partners are also worth exploring, since these can have a direct impact on operations.
Company Culture And Qualitative Analysis
The way employees view the company and its management is important. Are they satisfied and motivated, or do they resent their bosses? The rate of employee turnover can indicate employees’ loyalty or lack thereof. What does
workplace culture
say about the company? Overly hierarchical offices promote intrigue and competition and sap productive energy; a sleepy, unmotivated environment can mean employees are mainly concerned with punching the clock. The ideal is a vibrant, creative culture that attracts top talent.
Qualitative Data
Gathering data for qualitative analysis can sometimes be difficult. Fortune 500 CEOs are not known for sitting down with retail investors for a chat or showing them around the corporate headquarters. In part,
Warren Buffett
can use qualitative analysis so effectively because people are willing to give him access to their time and information. The rest of us have to sift through news reports and companies’ filings to get a sense of managers’ records, strategies, and philosophies.
The
management discussion and analysis (MD&A)
section of a company’s
10-K
filing and
quarterly earnings conference calls
provide a window into strategies and communication styles. Clear, transparent communication and coherent strategies are useful. Buzzwords, evasiveness, and short-termism, not so much.
Qualitative data can also be collected in a number of other ways, including interviews, panel groups, ethnography (participant observation), archival work, and document analysis. Qualitative data is often read carefully and coded thematically to identify themes, patterns, and trends.
Qualitative Analysis in a Business Context
Customers are the only group more crucial to a company’s success than management and employees, since they are the source of its
revenue
. Ironically, if a company places customers’ interests before shareholders, it may be a better long-term investment. If feasible, it’s a good idea to try being a customer. Say you’re considering investing in an airline that has reined in costs, beat
earnings estimates
in three consecutive quarters, and plans to
buy back shares
. When you try to actually use the airline, however, you find the website bug-ridden, the customer service representatives cranky, the extra fees petty, and your fellow passengers resentful. The negative experience tells you that the company has a lack of priority for its customers and to be careful investing in the airline.
A company’s
business model
and competitive advantage are vital components of qualitative analysis. What gives the firm an enduring leg up over its rivals? Has it invented a new technology that competitors will find hard to replicate, or that has
intellectual property
protection? Does it have a unique problem-solving approach for its customers? Is its brand globally recognized—in a good way? Does its product have cultural resonance or an element of nostalgia? Will there still be a market for it in 20 years? If you can plausibly imagine another company stepping in and doing what this one does just a little bit better, then the
barrier to entry
may be too low. Why will an unestablished company be the one to create or disrupt its chosen market, and why won’t it then be replaced in turn?
Example of Qualitative Analysis in Business
The idea behind quantitative analysis is to measure things; the idea behind qualitative analysis is to understand them. The latter requires a holistic view and a fact-based overarching narrative. Context is key. For example, a
CEO
who dropped out of college would be a red flag in some cases, but
Mark Zuckerberg
and
Steve Jobs
are exceptions. Silicon Valley is, for better or worse, a different beast. A look at McDonald’s Corp. (
MCD
) financials a few years ago would have told you nothing about a looming backlash against cheap, unhealthy food. On the other hand, a purely qualitative approach is vulnerable to distortion by blind spots and personal biases. Quantitative measures can act as a check on these tendencies.
Qualitative Analysis vs. Quantitative Analysis
Qualitative analysis relies on thick description and deep understanding of the subject being researched, obtained from in-depth interviews, observations, and/or close readings of text. This type of research typically looks at case studies and can be used to understand local phenomena.
Quantitative analysis instead relies on the statistical analyses of numerical data obtained from surveys, experiments, or administrative records. From this, inferences can be made and correlations between variables analyzed to understand more generalized phenomena.

Investopedia,Investing in Mutual Funds: What They Are and How They Work,"Close
Definition
A mutual fund is a financial vehicle in which shareholders put their money together to invest in securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, money market instruments). A fund manager chooses the best investments, and every investor shares in the profits if the investments do well.
What Are Mutual Funds?
A mutual fund gathers money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. For millions of Americans, these funds are the cornerstone of their retirement savings, offering professional management and built-in
diversification
that would be difficult to achieve on their own.
In a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings.
When you invest in a mutual fund, you’re essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the fund’s stated objectives—whether that’s aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index.
Key Takeaways
Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to build diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other securities managed by finance professionals.
Fund shares are priced once daily at market close based on the net asset value (NAV) of all holdings minus expenses divided by total shares.
Investors can earn returns through capital gains when fund holdings increase in value, dividend and interest distributions, or selling shares for a profit.
Key benefits include professional management, diversification, and relatively low investment minimums, though fees and expenses can impact returns.
Most Americans invest in mutual funds through employer retirement plans like 401(k)s, with over half of U.S. households owning fund shares.

Mutual Funds: How Many is Too Many?
How Mutual Funds Work
Mutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all of the fund’s underlying assets. The fund’s performance depends on its assets—if it’s full of stocks going up, it will go up. If they’re going down, so will the fund.

While a mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the fund’s strategy, many mutual funds are so-called index or
passive funds
, with portfolios that shouldn’t need too much management. They simply mirror the assets of indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
1
The biggest fund managers are
Vanguard and Fidelity
.
Tip
The reason mutual funds are so often the default for retirement accounts like 401(k)s is that they let you instantly diversify across hundreds of securities with a relatively modest amount of money.
The number of American households invested in mutual funds has increased significantly since they were introduced about half a century ago, from about 6% of households in 1980 to about 53% in the mid-2020s, including about 35% of Gen Z households.
2
Together, American households own about 88% of all mutual fund assets.
1
Mutual funds give everyday investors access to a diverse investment menu they likely couldn’t build on their own. Rather than putting all your money into one stock or bond—which can be risky—a mutual fund spreads your investments across many different securities.
3
How to Invest in Mutual Funds
Investing in mutual funds is relatively straightforward, involving the following steps:
Before buying shares, you should check with your employer to see if they offer mutual funds through your 401(k) or other retirement funds, since these might have matching funds—essentially doubling what you put in.
Once you know you won’t be investing in mutual funds through work, make sure you have a brokerage account with enough deposited to
buy the mutual fund shares
you want.
Identify mutual funds that match your investing goals regarding risk, returns, fees, and minimum investments. Many platforms offer fund screening tools.
Determine how much you want to invest and submit your trade. To increase your investment over time, you can often set up automatic periodic purchases of shares.
While these investments are often long-term, you should periodically check the fund’s performance and adjust as needed.
When it’s time to close your position, enter a sell order on your platform.
Types of Mutual Funds
There are many types among the more than 8,800 mutual funds in the United States, with most in four main categories: stock, money market, bond, and target-date funds.
4
Target-Date Funds: The ""Set-It-and-Forget-It"" Approach
Target-date funds
offer a straightforward approach to retirement investing by automatically adjusting their mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on when you plan to retire. These mutual funds, which often have years like “2045” or “2050” in their names, start with aggressive growth strategies and gradually become more conservative as you approach retirement.
These funds require
active management
—but not from you. Earlier in your career, the fund might invest 90% of your money in stocks for growth potential. As you near retirement, it shifts more money into bonds and cash to help protect your nest egg from market swings.
For example, a 30-year-old planning to retire in 2065 might choose a “2065 Target Date Fund.” Initially, this fund would primarily hold stocks. Over time, it automatically rebalances to include more conservative investments, cutting down on risk when you can least afford major losses.
However, target-date funds aren’t one-size-fits-all. Their fees can vary significantly, and their investment strategies—known as
glide paths
—differ among fund companies. Some funds maintain significant stock exposure even after retirement, while others take a more
conservative
approach.
5
Important
More than 90% of employee retirement plans in the U.S. use target-date funds as their default.
6
Stock Funds
This type of fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: firms with small-sized, midsized, or large-sized
capitalization
. Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity-style box like the example below.
7
Value funds
invest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks’ true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios and do not pay much in dividends.

A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a “blend.” These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle.

Large-cap companies have
market capitalizations
of over $10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between $250 million and $2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Midcap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap.
9
A mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall; these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box (large and value). The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above (small and growth).
Bond Funds
A mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of the
fixed-income
category. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other
debt instruments
. The bonds should generate interest income that’s passed on to the shareholders, with limited investment risk.
There are also actively managed funds that look for relatively undervalued bonds to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but aren’t without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities.
Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where and when they invest, and all bond funds have
interest rate risk
.
Fast Fact
Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies or
fund families
such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer.
Index Funds
Index mutual funds
are designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500. This passive strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to investors through fees, and these funds are designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind.

Definition
Notional value is the total amount of money that a position taken in a financial contract controls.
What Is Notional Value?
Notional value is a term often used by derivatives traders to refer to the total value of the underlying asset in a contract. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.
Put simply, it is the face value that is used to determine payments on a financial asset. This term is used when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, forwards, and currency markets.
Key Takeaways
Notional value is a term often used by derivatives traders to refer to the total value of the underlying
asset
in a contract.
Notional value is the same as face value, used to determine payments on a financial asset.
The notional value of derivatives contracts is much higher than the market value because leverage is used.
Notional value is integral in assessing portfolio risk and can be very useful when determining hedge ratios to offset that risk.
Notional value can be applied to interest rate swaps, total return swaps, equity options, and foreign currency derivatives.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Notional Value
Notional value is the face or total value of a position in a financial instrument, such as a
derivatives
trade. It helps distinguish the total value of a trade from the
market value
or cost of taking the trade.
There is a clear distinction between the two: notional value accounts for the total value of the position, while the market value is the price at which that position can be bought or sold in the marketplace.
Calculating Notional Value
Notional value can be calculated as follows:
NV
=
CS
×
UP
where:
NV
=
Notional Value
CS
=
Contract Size
UP
=
Underlying Price
\begin{aligned}&\text{NV}=\text{CS}\times\text{UP}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{NV}=\text{Notional Value}\\&\text{CS}=\text{Contract Size}\\&\text{UP}=\text{Underlying Price}\end{aligned}
​
NV
=
CS
×
UP
where:
NV
=
Notional Value
CS
=
Contract Size
UP
=
Underlying Price
​
The notional value of derivative contracts is much higher than the market value due to leverage (using borrowed money).
Leverage
allows someone to use a small amount of money to theoretically control a much larger amount. The amount of leverage used can be calculated by dividing notional value by market value.
1
L
=
NV
÷
MV
where:
L
=
Leverage
NV
=
Notional Value
MV
=
Market Value
\begin{aligned}&\text{L}=\text{NV}\div\text{MV}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{L}=\text{Leverage}\\&\text{NV}=\text{Notional Value}\\&\text{MV}=\text{Market Value}\end{aligned}
​
L
=
NV
÷
MV
where:
L
=
Leverage
NV
=
Notional Value
MV
=
Market Value
​
Notional value is integral in assessing
portfolio risk
, which can be very useful when determining hedge ratios to offset that risk.
2
For example, say a fund has a $1 million long exposure to U.S. equity markets, and the fund manager wants to offset that risk using the E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts.
They would have to sell an approximately equivalent amount of S&P 500 futures contracts to
hedge
their market exposure risk. If the notional value of each E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is $140,000, the market value is $10,000.

So, the fund manager would sell approximately seven E-mini S&P 500 contracts to effectively hedge their
long
cash position against market risk. The market value would be $70,000.
Uses in Swaps, Options, and Foreign Currencies
While
notional value can be used in futures
and stocks (total value of the stock position) in the ways discussed above, notional value also applies to interest rate swaps, total return swaps, equity options, and foreign currency derivatives.
Swaps
In
interest rate swaps
, the notional value is the specified value upon which interest rate payments will be exchanged. The notional value in interest rate swaps is used to come up with the amount of
interest due
. Typically, the notional value on these types of contracts is fixed during the contract's life.
Total return swaps
involve a party that pays a floating or fixed rate multiplied by a notional value amount plus the decrease in notional value. This is swapped for payments by another party that pays the
appreciation
of notional value.
Equity Options
Notional value in an
option
refers to the value that the option controls. For example, ABC trades for $20 with a particular ABC call option costing $1.50. One equity option controls 100 underlying shares. A trader purchases the option for $1.50 × 100 = $150.
The notional value of the option is $20 × 100 = $2,000. Buying the
stock option
contract would potentially give the trader control over 100 shares of stock for $150 compared with if they purchased the stocks outright for $2,000.
Fast Fact
The notional value of an equity options contract is the value of the shares controlled rather than the cost of the transaction.
Foreign Currency Exchange and Foreign Currency Derivatives
Foreign exchange (FX)
derivatives, like
forwards
and options, have two potential notional values. However, for typical
over-the-counter (OTC)
trades in FX derivatives, the notional value will be in line with the common quoting convention of the currency pair (primary currency/secondary currency).
3
For example, if the trade is in GBP/USD (GBP as the primary currency), then the amount of, say, £10,000,000 will commonly be the notional amount of the trade. But if the trade is in USD/JPY, the notional value would be $10,000,000, using USD as the primary currency. If the trade were in AUD/NZD, the notional amount would be in AUD, and so on.
Depending on the circumstances, the initiating
counterparty
may seek to use the secondary currency as the notional amount instead. For example, an American fund manager wants to buy USD 10 million worth of British stock, priced in GBP, when GBP/USD is currently trading at 1.3000. In this case, the notional amount would be $10 million, or £7.692 million. It’s mostly a matter of convenience for the two counterparties to decide on when initiating a trade.
Example of Notional Value
A contract has a unique, standardized size that can be based on factors such as weight, volume, or multiplier. For example, a single
COMEX
Gold futures contract unit (GC) is 100 troy ounces, and an E-mini S&P 500 Index futures contract has a $50 multiplier.
4
5
The notional value of the former is 100 times the market price of
gold
, while the notional value of the latter is 50 times the market price of the
S&P 500 Index
.
If someone buys an
E-mini S&P 500
contract at 2,800, then that single
futures contract
is worth $140,000 ($50 × 2,800). Therefore, $140,000 is the notional value of that underlying futures contract. However, the person buying this contract isn’t required to put up $140,000 when taking the trade.
Rather, they only need to put up an amount called the
initial margin
(market value), which is usually a fraction of the notional amount. The leverage used would be the notional amount divided by the price of buying the contract. If the price (initial margin) for one contract was $10,000, then the trader was able to use (140,000 ÷ 10,000) 14 times leverage.
Why Is Notional Value Important?
The notional value is the amount of an underlying asset that investment managers might seek to hedge against. In contrast, the market value will fluctuate over time based on market movements—which the
investor
might presumably seek to hedge—while the notional amount remains the same.
What Is the Difference Between Notional and Market Value?

value of the underlying asset

Investopedia,"Juris Doctor (JD): Definition, Requirements, History, and Jobs","Close
What Is a Juris Doctor (JD)?
A Juris Doctor (JD) is a three-year professional degree that confers recognition that the holder has a professional degree in law. Upon completion of a JD. program and passing the bar exam, individuals are eligible to practice law in their jurisdiction. This means they can represent clients, provide legal advice, and advocate for their clients in court.
Key Takeaways
The American law degree, called a Juris Doctor (JD), is a three-year professional degree.
Law school applicants must already have a bachelor's degree.
It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass the bar exam to practice law.
Drexel, Rutgers, Columbia, and Fordham are among the schools that offer a two-year J.D. degree option.
Understanding Juris Doctor (JD)
A JD degree is a professional graduate degree in law. It is the standard degree required to practice law in the United States and in most other common law jurisdictions. Most JD programs typically involves three years of full-time study or its equivalency in part-time studies.
Some schools offer a joint J.D. and
MBA
degree so that students can complete both degrees in less time than it would take to complete each separately. Other combined graduate degrees include public policy, medicine, and bioengineering.
Law school applicants must already have a
bachelor's degree
. It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass the
bar
exam to practice law. Each state and the District of Columbia has its own bar exam.
Fast Fact
Obtaining a JD degree is different than passing the bar. Most often, students pursue the materials needed to pass the bar as part of their JD studies.
History of the JD Degree
The first lawyers trained in the United States underwent an apprenticeship and training with a lawyer who served as a mentor. The first formal law degree granted in the country was a Bachelor of Law from the College of William and Mary in 1793. Harvard University changed the name of the degree to the Latin ""Legum Baccalaureus,"" known as the LL.B., and led the 19th-century movement for a scientific study of law.

The faculty of Harvard Law School first suggested changing the degree from LL.B. to J.D. in 1902 to reflect the professional nature of the degree. In 1903, the University of Chicago, which was one of only five law schools that required students to have a bachelor's degree before enrollment, granted the first J.D. degree.
1
Many law schools offered both an LL.B. to students who entered without a bachelor's degree and a J.D. to students entering with a bachelor's degree.
By the early 1960s, most students entered law school with a bachelor's degree. In 1965, the American Bar Association recommended the standard law degree be the J.D., and that decree took effect by the end of the decade.

Requirements for a JD Degree
In order to get into law school, you must have an undergraduate degree, have passed the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), request your official transcripts from your undergraduate institution(s), obtain letters of recommendation, and write a personal statement.
Complete a Bachelor's Degree
While many graduate programs require the completion of certain prerequisite courses, there are no such requirements for prospective law students. However, you must have earned (or be on track to earn) an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution. Your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) is a key indicator law schools consider when evaluating applicants.
Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT)
You'll also need to take the LSAT. The basic fee for the LSAT during the 2024-2025 academic year is $238 plus $207 for Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and an additional $45 fee for each CAS report sent to the law schools you apply to. Most people end up paying $500 or more in total LSAT fees.
4
It is generally recommended that you spend at least three months studying for the exam, although many people dedicate up to a year studying for the exam. There are many resources online to help you study for the LSAT, including free resources. Organized prep courses that guide you through the different components of the LSAT can be quite expensive. Some individuals opt to hire a private tutor to help them prepare for the LSAT.
Request Your Official Transcripts
Law schools require official transcripts from all undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs. Each copy of your official transcript can cost between $10 and $30, so depending on how many schools you apply to, this amount can add up.
5
6
The process of requesting your transcript and then getting them sent to the appropriate institution can take several days, so make sure that you give yourself adequate time.
Write a Personal Statement
A personal statement is your opportunity to reveal your personality to the admissions committee. It's a good idea if your personal statement covers your career goals and academic achievements, although there are many different approaches. Some schools may have specific prompts they want you to address in your personal statement.
Obtain Letters of Recommendation
Most law schools will require at least one letter of recommendation. Your letters of recommendation can be from undergraduate professors or former employers that can speak to various elements of your success.
Important
Tuition varies dramatically between law schools. In 2024, top law schools will cost an estimated $80,000, while there are plenty of laws schools that charge less than $20,000.
7
Two-Year JD Degrees
Job prospects for lawyers fell sharply following the 2008
financial market
collapse, and law school applications dropped by 38% from 2010 to 2013. With tuition continuing to rise, some schools have looked at shortening the program.
8
Drexel, Southwestern, and Albany Law are among the schools that offer a two-year J.D. option or allow students to start their first year of law school after completing the third year of college.
9
10
11
Common Coursework for JD Programs
JD programs typically structure their coursework to provide students with a fairly comprehensive study. During the first year, commonly referred to as the 1L year, students delve into foundational subjects such as contracts, torts, property law, criminal law, civil procedure, and constitutional law. These courses lay the groundwork for legal analysis and reasoning, both of which are leveraged as the student progresses with their degree.
As students progress into their second and third years, they often explore more specialized areas of law through. These may include corporate law, environmental law, intellectual property, family law, international law, or tax law. Students usually also get exposure to legal writing and research courses regardless of their specialization.
In addition to classes, many law schools offer clinical programs, externships, and internships where students can apply their legal knowledge in real-world settings. This gives prospective JDs an opportunity to function under the supervision of licensed attorneys.
12
Job Prospects for JD Degrees
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment outlook for lawyers is promising with a projected 5% growth from 2023 to 2033. This growth rate exceeds the average for all occupations. This growth is expected to result in approximately 35,600 job openings annually during this decade.
13
The demand for legal services remains high, driven by the legal needs of individuals, businesses, and government entities. However, increasing price competition may lead law firms to reconsider staffing and cost-saving measures.
Job Responsibilities for JD Holders
A juris doctor graduate performs a wide range of legal tasks and responsibilities which can vary depending on their specialization and practice area. Here are some common things that a JD holder may do.
Legal Research:
Lawyers use their research skills to investigate and understand the relevant laws, regulations, precedents, and case law that pertain to their clients' cases. They analyze legal sources to build strong arguments and support their clients' positions.
Client Consultation:
Lawyers meet with clients to discuss their legal issues and provide guidance. During these consultations, they assess the situation, offer legal advice, and discuss potential strategies or courses of action.
Document Drafting:
Lawyers are responsible for drafting various legal documents, including contracts, wills, deeds, legal briefs, pleadings, and agreements. These documents serve as formal records of legal transactions and arguments.
Negotiation:
Many lawyers engage in negotiation on behalf of their clients to reach mutually beneficial settlements and agreements. Negotiation skills are crucial in areas like family law, personal injury, and business transactions.
Legal Analysis:
Lawyers analyze complex legal issues, breaking them down to identify relevant laws, regulations, and case law. They assess the strengths and weaknesses of legal arguments and provide strategic advice to their clients.
Mediation and Arbitration:
Some lawyers specialize in alternative dispute resolution methods, like mediation and arbitration. They act as neutral parties to facilitate negotiations and resolve disputes without the need for a court trial.
Compliance and Regulatory Work:
Lawyers in areas such as corporate law, environmental law, and healthcare law ensure their clients comply with relevant laws and regulations. They help clients navigate complex regulatory frameworks and minimize legal risks.

What Is Universal Life (UL) Insurance?
Universal life (UL) insurance is a type of
permanent life insurance
that, like other permanent insurance, has a
cash value
element and offers lifetime coverage as long as you pay your
premiums
. Unlike whole life insurance, universal life allows you to raise or lower your premiums within certain limits, and it can be cheaper than whole life coverage. However, if your investments underperform or you underpay for too long, it could affect your
death benefit
or cause your policy to lapse.
1
Key Takeaways
Universal life (UL) insurance is a form of permanent life insurance with an investment savings element plus premiums and a death benefit that are flexible.
Unlike term life insurance, a UL insurance policy can accumulate cash value.
The cash value earns an interest rate set by the insurer, and it can change frequently, although there is usually a minimum rate that the policy can earn.
If the investments underperform, your cash value can go down and your premiums could eventually go up.
There are no tax implications for policyholders who borrow against the accumulated cash value of their UL policy, although some withdrawals may be taxed.
How Universal Life (UL) Insurance Works
UL insurance provides
more flexibility
than whole life insurance. Policyholders can adjust their premiums and death benefits. UL insurance premiums consist of two components: a cost of insurance (COI) amount and a saving component, known as the cash value.
As the name implies, the COI is the minimum amount of a premium payment required to keep the policy active. It consists of several items rolled together into one payment. COI includes the charges for mortality, policy administration, and other directly associated expenses to keep the life insurance policy in force. COI will vary by policy based on the policyholder’s age, insurability, and the insured risk amount.
Collected premiums in excess of the cost of UL insurance accumulate within the cash value portion of the policy. Over time, the cost of insurance will increase as the insured ages. However, if sufficient, the accumulated cash value will cover the increases in the COI.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Universal Life Insurance
Pros
Flexible premiums
Possible flexible death benefit
Potential cash value growth
Allows policy loans
Cons
Risk of large payment requirements or policy lapse
Returns are not guaranteed
Some withdrawals are taxed
Cash value lost at policyholder’s death
Pros Explained
Flexible Premiums
Unlike whole life insurance policies, which have fixed premiums over the life of the policy, a UL insurance policy generally has flexible premiums—within limits. Policyholders can make payments that are more than the COI. The excess premium is added to the cash value and accumulates
interest
.
1
Alternatively, if there is enough cash value, policyholders may lower or skip payments without the threat of a policy lapse.
Possible Flexible Death Benefit
Your policy may allow you to increase the size of your death benefit, although that may require a medical exam. You may also be able to lower your death benefit to lower your premiums.
Potential Cash Value Growth
Like all permanent life insurance, a UL insurance policy can
accumulate cash value
in something like a savings account. The cash value earns interest based on the current market or the policy’s minimum interest rate, whichever is greater. As it accumulates, policyholders may take out a portion of the cash value in the form of partial withdrawals or loans.
Allows Policy Loans
Universal life policyholders may borrow against the accumulated cash value without tax implications. The
interest rates
on these loans are often lower than rates available for a personal loan, and they don’t require a credit check. However, unpaid
loans
will reduce the death benefit by the outstanding amount.
2
Cons Explained
Risk of Large Payment Requirements or Policy Lapse
While the ability to lower your premiums and to make withdrawals in times of need help make universal life a very flexible insurance type, you have to watch your account carefully. If your cash value falls to zero and your premiums don’t cover the cost of insurance, then your policy can lapse.
1
Returns Are Not Guaranteed
If interest rates drop, your cash value may not perform well.
1
Unlike whole life, universal life cash value does not earn a guaranteed rate. However, most UL policies come with a minimum rate so that your losses are limited.
Some Withdrawals Are Taxable
When UL policyholders withdraw some of the cash value, it will be taxable. In general, life insurance is taxed on a
first in, first out (FIFO)
method, meaning that the policy owner will receive their investment in the contract first before receiving any gains in the policy (or being taxed on those gains).
3
However, if you withdraw more than you’ve paid into the policy, your withdrawals will be taxed.
4
Cash Value Lost at Policyholder’s Death
When a policyholder dies, the insurance company keeps the account’s cash value. Your beneficiaries will be paid just the death benefit, as the policyholder can only use the cash value while they are alive.

Universal life is a form of permanent life insurance that gives policyholders flexibility in paying premiums, a cash savings component, and a death benefit.
Universal life insurance allows you to borrow against or cash in your savings portion, which grows tax-deferred over your lifetime.
Term life
provides coverage, often through an employer, for a set number of years, generally 20 or 30, and expires once the term is up.
Term life is usually more affordable
, with low premiums, but there isn’t a cash component to borrow from or cash in, nor is there a death benefit if you die after the term is up.
Tip
UL premium costs may change with interest rates and as the policyholder grows older.
Whole life insurance is also a form of permanent life insurance, with a cash value savings component. An important difference between universal life and whole life insurance, however, is that the UL interest rate is not guaranteed. It is set by the insurer and can change frequently.
Whole life insurance
premiums are fixed for the life of the policy, whereas universal life premiums can vary.
Cash value and death benefits are guaranteed
with whole life, but not with universal life.
What is universal life (UL) insurance, and how does it work?
UL insurance policies are a form of permanent life insurance with flexible premiums. Unlike term life, UL policies can accumulate interest-bearing funds like a savings account. Also, policyholders can adjust their premiums and possibly their death benefit, and those paying extra toward their premium receive interest on that excess.
What is the biggest disadvantage of universal life insurance?
A big disadvantage is that you need to keep an eye on the cash value. If you don’t, then the policy could become underfunded, meaning you’ll have to make big payments to keep the policy active. Also, there is risk that when interest rates drop, your cash value won’t grow as much as you had hoped. However, there is typically a minimum interest rate, so you’re somewhat protected.
Which is better: whole life or universal life?
Both whole life and universal life are forms of permanent life insurance and provide a cash value savings component that policyholders may borrow from or cash out. Whole life offers fixed premiums, while UL premiums may start out lower but are flexible, so they may increase as you age. Depending on the amount of coverage and flexibility that you want in a permanent policy, either form may be a good choice for your situation.
What is the difference between universal life and whole life insurance?
Whole life insurance is more stable because the death benefit will never go down if you pay you",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/universallife.asp

Definition
Mergers and acquisitions is a term used to describe businesses combining through different types of transactions.
What Are Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)?
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are the process of consolidating companies or major assets of companies through financial transactions. A company may:
Purchase and absorb another company outright
Merge with it to create a new company
Acquire some or all of its major assets
Make a
tender offer
for its stock
Stage a hostile takeover
All of these ways of combining or consolidating assets are
M&A activities
. The term M&A is also used for the divisions of
financial institutions
that facilitate or manage such activities.
Key Takeaways
In an acquisition, one company purchases another outright.
In a merger, two companies combine to create a new legal entity under the banner of one corporate name.
M&A activities can be financed through a combination of debt, cash, and stock.
A company's bid to take over another company can be friendly or hostile.
What's an Acquisition?
Understanding Mergers vs. Acquisitions
The terms mergers and acquisitions are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.
When one company absorbs another and establishes itself as the new owner, the purchase is called an acquisition. Unfriendly or
hostile takeover
deals are always regarded as acquisitions. However, an acquisition can be done with the willing participation of both companies.
In a merger, two companies join forces to reinvent themselves as a single new entity. In general, the two firms are of approximately the same size, and this action is known as a
merger of equals
.
For example, when Daimler-Benz and Chrysler
merged
, those companies ceased to exist. A new company, DaimlerChrysler, was created. Both companies' stocks were surrendered, and new company stock was issued in its place.
1
DaimlerChrysler underwent another name and ticker change to the Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG) in February 2022.
2
Fast Fact
A purchase deal may be called a merger when their CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both companies.
A deal can be classified as a merger or an acquisition based on whether the acquisition is friendly or hostile and how it is announced. The difference lies in how the deal is communicated to the target company's
board of directors
, employees, and
shareholders
.
Lara Antal/Investopedia
Important
M&A deals generate sizable profits for the investment banking industry, but not all mergers or acquisition deals close.
3
Types of Mergers and Acquisitions
The following are some common transactions that fall under the M&A umbrella.
Mergers
In a merger, the
boards of directors
of two companies approve the combination and seek shareholders' approval.
This type of M&A activity is designed to benefit both brands, allowing each to bring their existing strengths to a new company and enjoy a bigger piece of the industry pie.
For example, in 2024, the holding company HBC announced that it was acquiring the Neiman Marcus Group and merging it with another brand that it owned, Saks Fifth Avenue.
Both NMG (which owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman) and Saks are luxury retailers, but their share of retail sales has declined with the rise of online shopping and the reduction of brick-and-mortar retail. The merger consolidates three existing brands (Saks, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman) into a single luxury retail brand known as Saks Global. This consolidation is intended to make it easier to compete with the online retail giants.
4
Acquisitions
In a straightforward acquisition, the acquiring company obtains the majority stake in the acquired firm, which does not change its name or alter its organizational structure.
In some cases, the target company may require the buyers to promise that the target business remains solvent for a period after acquisition through the use of a
whitewash resolution
. An acquisition often allows the acquiring company to move into a new or related industry, expanding its offerings by tapping into the acquired company's existing customer base and services.
An example of this type of transaction was Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017. The acquisition allowed Amazon to expand into grocery delivery services and tap into the market for health-conscious customers.
5
Whole Foods, which had been losing market share to lower-priced grocery chains, benefitted from Amazon's broad customer base and ease of connecting with consumers.
Consolidations
In a corporate
consolidation
, two or more companies combine to increase their market share and eliminate competition.
For example, Facebook has consolidated its dominance of social media by acquiring other companies that had promising business models and could have become competitive with Facebook.
An example is Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion.
6
Instagram continued to operate as a separate company under the parent Facebook company (now Meta Platforms).
Other instances of consolidation under Facebook resulted in acquired social media companies being integrated into the Facebook platform. For example, the messaging service Beluga was acquired by Facebook and rebranded as Facebook Messenger.
Tender Offers
In a tender offer, one company offers to purchase the outstanding stock of the other company at a specific price rather than the market price. The acquiring company communicates the offer directly to the other company's shareholders, bypassing the management and board of directors.
7
For example, in 2008, Johnson & Johnson made a tender offer to acquire Omrix Biopharmaceuticals for $438 million.
8
The company agreed to the tender offer and the deal was settled by the end of December 2008.
9
Acquisition of Assets
In an acquisition of assets, one company directly acquires the assets of another company. The company whose assets are being acquired must obtain approval from its shareholders.
The purchase of assets is typical during
bankruptcy
proceedings. Companies bid for various assets of the bankrupt company, which is liquidated upon the final transfer of assets to their new owners.
Management Acquisitions
In a management acquisition, also known as a
management-led buyout
(MBO), a company's executives purchase a controlling stake in another company, taking it private. These former executives often partner with a financier or former corporate officers to help fund the transaction.
This type of M&A transaction is typically financed disproportionately with debt, and the majority of shareholders must approve it.
For example, in 2022, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk purchased Twitter, Inc. for $44 billion, taking the company private. The deal included $25.5 billion of margin loan and debt financing.
10
How Mergers Are Structured
Mergers can be structured in various ways depending on the relationship between the two companies involved in the deal:
Horizontal merger
:
Two companies that are in direct competition and share the same product lines and
markets
merge
Vertical merger
:
A company merges with a supplier, such as an ice cream maker buying its cone supplier
Congeneric mergers
:
Two businesses that serve the same consumer base in different ways, such as a TV manufacturer and a cable company, combine
Market-extension merger
:
Two companies that sell the same products in different markets combine
Product-extension merger
: Two companies selling different but related products in the same market merge
Conglomeration
:
Two companies that have no common business areas combine
Mergers may also be distinguished by following one of two financing methods, each with its own ramifications for investors.
Purchase Mergers
As the name suggests, this kind of merger occurs when one company purchases another company. The purchase is made in cash or through the issue of a bond or other debt instrument.
The sale is taxable, which attracts the acquiring companies, who enjoy the tax benefits. Acquired assets can be written up to the actual purchase price, and the difference between the
book value
and the purchase price of the assets can
depreciate
annually, reducing taxes payable by the acquiring company.
Consolidation Mergers
A new company is formed, and both companies are bought and combined under the new entity. The tax terms are the same as those of a purchase merger.
Vertical vs. Horizontal Acquisitions
Horizontal integration
and
vertical integration
are strategies that companies use to consolidate their position among competitors.
Horizontal integration is the acquisition of a related business. A company that opts for horizontal integration will take over another company that operates at the same level of the
value chain
in an industry—for instance when Marriott International, Inc. acquired Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
11
Vertical integration is the process of acquiring business operations within the same production vertical. In this type of acquisition, a company is taking control over one or more key stages in the production or distribution of its products. Apple, for example, acquired AuthenTec, which makes the touch-ID fingerprint sensor technology that goes into its iPhones.
12
How Acquisitions Are Financed
A company can
buy another company
with cash, stock, assumption of debt, or a combination of all three. At times, the investment bank involved in the sale of one company might offer financing to the buying company. This is known as
staple financing
and is done to produce larger and timely bids.
In smaller deals, it is common for one company to acquire all of another company's assets. Company X buys all of Company Y's assets for cash, which means that Company Y will have only cash (and debt, if any). Company Y will eventually
liquidate
or enter other areas of business.
Another acquisition deal known as a
reverse merger
enables a private company to become publicly listed in a relatively short time. Reverse mergers occur when a private compan",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp

Net asset value (NAV) is the difference between a company’s assets and its liabilities calculated at the end of each business day.
What Is Net Asset Value?
Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an investment fund that's determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. The fund's per-share NAV is then obtained by dividing NAV by the number of shares outstanding.
Per-share NAV is most commonly used with a mutual fund or unit investment trusts. It's the price at which the shares of the funds registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) trade. NAV can change daily. Per-share NAV can therefore change as well.
Key Takeaways
NAV is the value of an investment fund that's determined by subtracting liabilities from assets.
The per-share NAV is calculated by dividing the NAV by the number of shares outstanding.
NAV and per-share NAV are calculated for a
mutual fund
or a
unit investment trust
.
NAV is calculated at the end of each business day using the closing market prices of the portfolio's securities.
Investopedia / Nez Riaz
How Net Asset Value Works
The difference between assets and liabilities for companies and business entities is known as the net assets, the net worth, or the capital of the company. NAV is also applied to fund valuation and pricing.
A fund’s per-share NAV makes pricing easy for investors to understand so it's used to value and conduct the buying and selling of a fund's shares.
1
NAV per individual share is often close to or equal to the book value per share of a business. Companies that are considered to have high growth prospects are traditionally valued more than NAV might suggest. Per-share NAV for closed-end funds is frequently compared to the stock price or market value per share to find undervalued or overvalued investments.

NAV Formula
NAV = Assets - Liabilities
NAV per share = (Assets - Liabilities) / Total number of outstanding shares
NAV Example
Let's look at a calculation for the per-share NAV of a mutual fund. Assume that the fund has $100 million worth of investments in different securities, a figure that's calculated from the day's closing prices for each security.
It also has $7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, $4 million in total receivables, and accrued income for the day of $75,000. The fund has $13 million in short-term liabilities and $2 million in long-term liabilities. Accrued expenses for the day are $10,000.
The fund has 5 million shares outstanding.
1. To determine per-share NAV, first calculate the fund's NAV:
Total assets are:
$100,000,000 + $7,000,000 + $4,000,000 + $75,000, or $111,075,000
Total liabilities are:
$13,000,000 + $2,000,000 + $10,000, or $15,010,000
NAV = $111,075,000 - $15,010,000, or $96,065,000
2. Next, calculate per-share NAV:
Per-share NAV = $96,065,000 / 5,000,000, or $19.21
Important
The actual purchase price that investors pay for mutual fund shares would be the per-share NAV plus related fees such as sales loads. The amount they receive when redeeming shares would be the per-share NAV less related fees such as redemption fees.
1
Mutual Funds and NAV
Mutual funds collect money from a large number of investors. They then use that money to invest in securities such as stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Each investor gets a specified number of shares in proportion to their invested amount. The pricing of each share is based on NAV.
Mutual fund pricing is typically calculated based on the daily closing prices of the securities in the fund, unlike a stock whose price changes are posted throughout the day.
Managers of a mutual fund compute the closing price of all the securities within its portfolio at the end of the trading day. They add the value of any additional assets, account for liabilities, and calculate NAV. They also calculate the per-share NAV using NAV and the number of outstanding shares.
1
Closed-End vs. Open-End Funds NAV
An open-end fund can issue an unlimited number of shares, doesn't trade on exchanges, and is priced each day at the close of trading using its NAV. Most mutual funds such as those in 401k plans are open-end funds.
2
Closed-end funds are listed on a stock exchange. They trade similarly to securities and can trade at a price that's not equal to their NAV.
3
ETFs
trade like stocks and their market value can differ from their actual NAV. This allows for profitable trading opportunities for active ETF traders who can spot timely opportunities.
ETFs also calculate their NAV daily at the close of the market for reporting purposes similar to mutual funds. They also calculate and disseminate intraday NAV multiple times per minute in real-time, however.
2
NAV and Fund Performance
Fund investors often try to assess the performance of a mutual fund based on their NAV differentials between two dates. An investor might compare the NAV on Jan. 1 to the NAV on Dec. 31 and see the difference in the two values as a gauge of the fund’s performance. Changes in NAV between two dates aren’t the best representation of mutual fund performance, however.
Mutual funds commonly pay out all their income like dividends and interest earned to their shareholders. Mutual funds are additionally obligated to distribute the accumulated realized
capital gains
to the shareholders.
4
The NAV decreases accordingly as these two components of income and gains are regularly paid out. A mutual fund investor earns income and returns but individual earnings aren't reflected in the absolute NAV values when compared between two dates.
A reliable measure of mutual fund performance is the annual total return which is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period. Investors and analysts also look at
compounded annual growth rate (CAGR)
which represents the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period longer than one year.
What's the Difference Between Mutual Fund NAV and Book Value Per Common Share?
The book value per common share reflects an analysis of the price of a share of stock of an individual company. NAV reflects the total value of a mutual fund after subtracting its liabilities from its assets.
What Are the Trading Timelines for NAV?
NAV is computed and reported as of a particular business date but all the buy and sell orders for mutual funds are processed at the per-share NAV on their trade dates. Buy and sell orders received before 1:30 p.m. on a particular day will be executed at the per-share NAV determined on that day if regulators mandate a cutoff time of 1:30 p.m. Any orders received after the cutoff time will be executed at the per-share NAV of the next business day.
What's the Difference Between NAV and Shareholder Equity?
Equity is calculated by including intangible assets which can include items like patents. NAV is calculated using only tangible assets.
The Bottom Line
Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an investment fund that's determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. Per-share NAV is calculated by dividing NAV by the number of shares outstanding. Funds can be open or closed and the pricing of each share is based on NAV.

Definition
The Rule of 72 calculates how long your investment will need to double in value, given its annual rate of return. It is a mathematical formula.
What Is the Rule of 72?
The Rule of 72 is a quick, useful formula that is popularly used to estimate the number of years required to double invested money at a given annual
rate of return
. Alternatively, it can compute the annual rate of
compounded return
from an investment, given how many years it will take to double the investment.
While calculators and spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel have functions to accurately calculate the precise time required to
double the invested money
, the Rule of 72 comes in handy for mental calculations to quickly gauge an approximate value. For this reason, the Rule of 72 is often taught to beginning investors, as it is easy to comprehend and calculate. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also cites the Rule of 72 in grade-level financial literacy resources.
1
Key Takeaways
The Rule of 72 is a simplified formula that calculates how long it’ll take for an investment to double in value, based on its rate of return.
The Rule of 72 applies to compounded interest rates and is reasonably accurate for interest rates that fall in the range of 6% and 10%.
The Rule of 72 can be applied to anything that increases exponentially, such as GDP or inflation; it can also indicate the long-term effect of annual fees on an investment’s growth.
This estimation tool can also be used to estimate the rate of return needed for an investment to double given an investment period.
For different situations, it’s often better to use the Rule of 69, Rule of 70, or Rule of 73.
Daniel Fishel / Investopedia
Formula for the Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 can be leveraged in two different ways to determine an expected doubling period or required rate of return.
Years to Double: 72 / Expected Rate of Return
To calculate the time period that an investment will double, divide the integer 72 by the expected rate of return. The formula relies on a single average rate over the life of the investment. The findings hold true for fractional results, as all decimals represent an additional portion of a year.

Expected Rate of Return: 72 / Years to Double
To calculate the expected rate of interest, divide the integer 72 by the number of years required to double your investment. The number of years does not need to be a whole number; the formula can handle fractions or portions of a year. In addition, the resulting expected rate of return assumes compounding interest at that rate over the entire
holding period
of an investment.
Fast Fact
The Rule of 72 applies to cases of compound interest, not simple interest.
Simple interest
is determined by multiplying the daily
interest rate
by the principal amount and by the number of days that elapse between payments. Compound interest is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit.
How to Use the Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 could apply to anything that grows at a compounded rate, such as population, macroeconomic numbers, charges, or loans. For example, if the
gross domestic product (GDP)
grows at 4% annually, the economy will be expected to double in 72 / 4% = 18 years.
With regards to the fee that eats into investment gains, the Rule of 72 can be used to demonstrate the long-term effects of these costs. A mutual fund that charges 3% in
annual expense fees
will reduce the investment principal to half in around 24 years. A borrower who pays 12% interest on their credit card (or any other form of loan that is charging
compound interest
) will double the amount they owe in six years.
The rule can also be used to find the amount of time it takes for money’s value to halve due to
inflation
. If inflation is 6%, then a given purchasing power of the money will be worth half in around 12 years (72 / 6 = 12). If inflation decreases from 6% to 4%, an investment will be expected to lose half its value in 18 years, instead of 12 years.
Additionally, the Rule of 72 can be applied across all kinds of durations provided the rate of return is compounded annually. If the
interest
per quarter is 4% (but interest is only compounded annually), then it will take (72 / 4) = 18 quarters or 4.5 years to double the principal. If the population of a nation increases at the rate of 1% per month, it will double in 72 months, or six years.
Who Came Up With the Rule of 72?
The Rule of 72 dates back to 1494, when Luca Pacioli referenced the rule in his comprehensive mathematics book called “Summa de Arithmetica.”
2
Pacioli makes no derivation or explanation of why the rule may work, so some suspect the rule predates Pacioli’s novel.
3
How Do You Calculate the Rule of 72?
Here’s how the Rule of 72 works. You take the number 72 and divide it by the investment’s projected annual return. The result is the number of years, approximately, it’ll take for your money to double.
For example, if an investment scheme promises an 8% annual compounded rate of return, it will take approximately nine years (72 / 8 = 9) to double the invested money. Note that a compound annual return of 8% is plugged into this equation as 8, and not 0.08, giving a result of nine years (and not 900).
If it takes nine years to double a $1,000 investment, then the investment will grow to $2,000 in year nine, $4,000 in year 18, $8,000 in year 27, and so on.
How Accurate Is the Rule of 72?
The Rule of 72 formula provides a reasonably accurate, but approximate, timeline—reflecting the fact that it’s a simplification of a more complex logarithmic equation. To get the exact doubling time, you would need to do the entire calculation.
The precise formula for calculating the exact doubling time for an investment earning a compounded interest rate of r% per period is:
To find out exactly how long it would take to double an investment that returns 8% annually, you would use the following equation:
T = ln(2) / ln (1 + (8 / 100)) = 9.006 years
As you can see, this result is very close to the approximate value obtained by (72 / 8) = 9 years.
What Is the Difference Between the Rule of 72 and the Rule of 73?
The Rule of 72 primarily works with interest rates or rates of return that fall in the range of 6% and 10%. When dealing with rates outside this range, the rule can be adjusted by adding or subtracting 1 from 72 for every 3 points the interest rate diverges from the 8% threshold.
For example, the rate of 11% annual compounding interest is 3 percentage points higher than 8%. Hence, adding 1 (for the 3 points higher than 8%) to 72 leads to using the rule of 73 for higher precision. For a 14% rate of return, it would be the rule of 74 (adding 2 for 6 percentage points higher), and for a 5% rate of return, it will mean reducing 1 (for 3 percentage points lower) to lead to the rule of 71.
For example, say you have a very attractive investment offering a 22% rate of return. The basic rule of 72 says the initial investment will double in 3.27 years. However, since (22 - 8) is 14, and (14 ÷ 3) is 4.67 ≈ 5, the adjusted rule should use 72 + 5 = 77 for the numerator. This gives a value of 3.5 years, indicating that you’ll have to wait an additional quarter to double your money compared to the result of 3.27 years obtained from the basic rule of 72. The period given by the logarithmic equation is 3.49, so the result obtained from the adjusted rule is more accurate.
For daily or
continuous compounding
, using 69.3 in the numerator gives a more accurate result. Some people adjust this to 69 or 70 for the sake of easy calculations.
The Bottom Line
The Rule of 72 can also estimate how long it will take for
debt
to double, at a fixed annual rate of return.
You would divide 72 by the interest rate on a loan to see how quickly your debt could double if you only make minimum payments. For example, a
credit card
with a 20% interest rate would double your debt in just 3.6 years (72 / 20 = 3.6).
The Rule of 72 highlights how important it is to pay off high-interest debt quickly, to avoid it
spiraling
out of control.

An ""out of the money"" option has no intrinsic value.
Investors use
options
to profit from price movements and protect against potential losses in their portfolios. However, before adding this useful tool to your investing arsenal, it’s important to get to grips with how these contracts work and the jargon.
One of the key option-related terms you’ll come across is ""moneyness."" Options are described as “in the money,” “out of the money,” or “at the money” depending on their
intrinsic value
at any given moment. As implied in the name, “out of the money,” the subject of this article, is an option that can’t currently be exercised for a profit.
1
Key Takeaways
An out of the money option can't currently be exercised for a profit but it still holds value based on the time left before expiration and the possibility of the strike price being reached.
The value of an OTM option depends on how much time is left and the volatility of the underlying security.
While OTM options carry a higher risk of expiring worthless, they appeal to traders with less capital or who are willing to bet on big price movements.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Options: Basic Concepts
Options give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security, such as a stock, bond, or currency, at a certain price, called the
strike price
, by a specified date, known as the
expiration date
.
1
In every transaction, there are two sides betting against each other. There’s the seller, who creates an option they hope won’t be exercised, in exchange for a fee called the
premium
. And there's the buyer, who pays for the option in the belief that the strike price will be exceeded, making them money.
1
Important
American-style options can be exercised any time before the expiration date or on it, while European-style options can only be exercised on the exact expiration date.
2
When buying an option, you bet its price will rise above the strike price, which requires buying a
call option
, or that the price will fall below the strike price, which requires buying a
put option
.

Example
James thinks Company ABC’s share price will rise to at least $500. Rather than buy the stock, he purchases a call option for $200, giving him the option to buy 100 shares, which currently trade at $400, for $430 within six months.
Should Company ABC rise to $500 within six months, James could exercise the option, in which case he’d buy the stock for $430 and then sell it for $500. That would net him a return of $7,000 ($70 x 100 shares), minus the $200 premium and any trading fees.
The same example can be applied the other way around. If James thought Company ABC's share price was set to fall significantly, he would buy a put option, paying a fee in exchange for the right to sell Lockheed’s shares at a specified price within the specified time frame.
For that move to be profitable, Lockheed’s share price needs to fall below the strike price offered by the options contract writer. If it did, James would exercise the option and cash in. If it didn’t, he’d walk away with a loss limited to the cost of the put option contract.
Defining 'Out of the Money' (OTM)
Deciding whether to exercise an option depends primarily on the relationship between the market price of the security you’ve chosen and the strike price.
Options can be:
In-The-Money (
ITM
):
The strike price is favorable compared to the current market price and you could profit by exercising the option.
At-The-Money (
ATM
)
. This means the strike price is equal to or very near the current price of the underlying asset. You wouldn’t make any real money by immediately exercising your right to buy or sell but that could change with a small price movement in your favor.
Out-Of-The-Money (
OTM
)
. The strike price isn’t favorable and you would lose money if you exercised the option.
1
An option to buy a stock at $120 that currently trades at $100 or sell a stock at $100 that currently trades at $120 would be deemed OTM. OTM is essentially the worst situation an investor in possession of an unexpired option can find themselves in. When an option is OTM, it currently has no intrinsic value, meaning if you exercise it now you’d lose money.
Nevertheless, OTM options may still be worth something eventually. That’s because they still possess extrinsic or
time value
. As long as there's still a chance the stock in the example rises above $120 or below $100, it has some value. How much depends mainly on how much time is left before the option expires and the volatility profile of the security. The more the security is prone to price swings and the longer the time left, the better.
Characteristics of OTM Options
OTM options have several distinct characteristics. Key traits include:
Not worth exercising now
. If an OTM option is exercised now the holder will lose money because the strike price hasn't been reached.
Time is key
. OTM options aren’t without value. There is still a chance they can move into a profitable position before they expire. The further away the expiration date is the better; this means having more time to reach the objective.
Cheaper
. OTM options cost less than ITM and ATM options with the same expiration date because they can’t yet be exercised at a profit and hitting the strike price often requires a significant price move. Time is the only thing on their side.
Example of OTM Options
Matt is bullish on Company XYZ. He thinks it is undervalued at $120 a share, so buys a call option on the stock with a $150 strike price. This option expires in five months and costs $1. Each option contract represents 100 shares, so the total cost of the option is $100 (100 x $1) plus any trading fees.
3
Matt now has to wait. To make a profit from the trade, he must exercise the option when Company XYZ's shares trade at a minimum of $151. Obviously, the higher the share price goes, the better.
Sadly, it doesn’t work out that way. The share price experiences an initial bounce to $155, pushing the option ITM, but Matt believes more upside is in store and decides to wait. Not long after, gloomy economic data dents sentiment, causing shares to seesaw between $100 and $115 over the next few months.
With one month left, Matt has a few possibilities. He can sell the option, which is still worth something but less than the $100 he paid because the price is now lower and there’s little time remaining. Or he can hold on and hope the company's shares rally. He opts for the latter.
Two weeks later, Company XYZ's shares rocket to $145. Given the changing economic backdrop, Matt doubts they will rise much higher in the little time remaining but doesn’t want to lose the $100 he paid for the option. As the shares aren’t far off the strike price, Matt manages to sell the option contract for $0.90 per share, or $90, thus limiting his loss to just $10 plus trading fees.
The Bottom Line
Out of the money (OTM) options are contracts that currently have no intrinsic value because they can't currently be exercised for a profit. But they still hold value, based on their potential to turn profitable before their expiration date if the market moves in their favor. In fact, some investors prefer buying out of the money options because they're cheaper and offer a higher potential return. But out of the money options come with a lower probability of turning a profit and lose value as the expiration day approaches.

A chartered financial analyst (CFA) is a globally recognized designation awarded by the CFA Institute to professionals who have demonstrated a high level of knowledge in the investment field.
What Is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)?
The chartered financial analyst (CFA) charter is a professional designation offered by the
CFA Institute
, an organization that measures and certifies the competence and integrity of financial analysts. Candidates must pass three levels of exams covering accounting, economics, ethics, money management, and security analysis.
From 1963 through May 2025, more than 3.9 million candidates had taken the CFA exam. The overall pass rate was 45%. From 2016 through 2025, the 10-year average pass rate was 43%.
1
Key Takeaways
Candidates must have a bachelor’s degree and at least 4,000 hours of relevant professional experience over a minimum of three years.
Passing the CFA Program exams requires strong discipline and an extensive amount of studying.
There are more than 200,000 CFA charter holders worldwide in 164 countries.
It takes, on average, about four years for an individual to earn the CFA designation.
Julie Bang / Investopedia
The Basics of Becoming a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)
The CFA charter is one of the most respected designations in finance and is widely considered to be the gold standard in the field of investment analysis.
The designation is handed out by the CFA Institute, which is a global nonprofit professional organization of more than 200,000 charter holders,
portfolio managers
, and other financial professionals in 164 countries and 160 local member societies.
2
The CFA’s meaning concerns the stated mission of the CFA Institute, which is to develop and promote a high level of educational, ethical, and professional standards in the investment industry.
Requirements
Before becoming a CFA charter holder, a candidate must meet one of the following educational requirements:
The candidate must have four years of professional work experience, a bachelor’s degree, or be in the final year of a bachelor’s degree program.
Or they must have 4,000 hours of work experience over a minimum of three years.
For the undergraduate qualification, the bachelor’s program must be completed before registering for the Level III exam.
In addition to the educational requirement, the candidate must have an international passport, complete the assessment in English, meet the professional conduct admission criteria, and live in a participating country.
3
After meeting the enrollment requirements, the candidate must pass all three levels of the CFA Program in sequential order.
3
Professional reference letters are also required. The candidate must then become a member of the CFA Institute and pay annual dues.
Finally, they must sign off annually that they are following the CFA Institute
code of ethics
and standards of professional conduct. Failure to adhere to the code of ethics and standards is grounds for the possible lifetime revocation of the CFA charter.
3
Exams
Passing the CFA Program exams requires strong discipline and an extensive amount of studying. The Level I exam can be taken four times a year, in February, May, August, and November. The Level II exam can be taken three times a year, in May, August, and November. The Level III exam can be taken twice a year, in February and August.
4
Although the exams can be taken as many times as needed, each exam typically requires candidates to study over 300 hours.
5
Given the considerable amount of time that must be spent studying, many candidates are deterred from continuing the CFA Program after failing one of the levels.
The exams are difficult. Only 45% of candidates passed the exams from 1963 to 2025. Having the right plan and the discipline to follow the plan are essential skills for passing all three exams. Notably, 2019 saw the most test takers of any year. But numbers have not rebounded from the sharp decline seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.
1
The CFA Institute has over 400 test centers worldwide. It has been adding testing locations in Asia due to increased demand in that region.
6
Important
The pass rate for the exam is below 50% in recent decades, making the CFA charter one of the most difficult financial certifications to obtain.
1
A minimum of 300 hours of study is recommended for each exam.
7
Level I Exam
The CFA Level I examination focuses on financial analysis using the tools of the 10 topic areas of the candidate’s
body of knowledge
.
7
These areas are ethical and professional standards, quantitative methods, economics, financial statement and analysis, corporate finance, equity investments, fixed income,
derivatives
, alternative investments, and portfolio management. The exam format is 180 multiple-choice questions to be completed within four and a half hours.
7
CFA Level I Exam Topic Weights.
Level II Exam
The Level II exam focuses on the valuation of various assets and emphasizes the application of investment tools and concepts in contextual situations.
Exam questions referring to Financial Reporting and Analysis are typically based on
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
. The exam has 22 item sets (mini case studies) with 88 multiple-choice questions (110 questions total).
8
CFA Level II Exam Topic Weights.
Level III Exam
The Level III exam focuses on effective wealth planning and portfolio management. It requires the candidate to synthesize all the concepts and analytical methods learned from the entire curriculum.
The exam format is multipart, with 11 item sets and 11 essay questions to be completed within four hours and 24 minutes. The handwritten answers are graded by hand.

Challenges of Achieving the CFA Charter
The CFA charter is widely respected, globally recognized, and a worthwhile undertaking to accomplish. However, it is not a guaranteed path to riches and glory. So, before taking the plunge, carefully consider how difficult it can be to earn one.
1. The CFA is not a quick fix for an ailing career. If that’s why you’re enrolling in the program, you should carefully consider the work involved in the CFA path ahead of you. You might instead choose to improve your
soft skills
, such as your work ethic and communication capability.
2. The CFA requires a huge investment of time—a recommended minimum of 300 hours of studying per exam for three exams.
5
If you don’t pass an exam the first time, you’ll have to reapply your efforts. You will likely sacrifice time with family, friends, and the hobbies that you enjoy. And after committing all that time, there is no guarantee that you will earn the charter.
3. While cost may not be a major consideration, it is worth careful deliberation. A Level I candidate pays a one-time program enrollment fee plus an exam registration fee. Level II and III candidates pay a registration fee as well. There is also the cost of the books and study programs you’ll need. Altogether, you should expect to spend several thousand dollars each time you attempt the exams.
How Long Does It Take to Pass the CFA Exams?
The CFA exams are difficult and have a high failure rate. Each exam requires at least 300 hours of study, on average.
5
Successful candidates take an average of more than four years to earn the designation.
10
How Much Do the CFA Exams Cost?
Each of the three levels of the CFA exam costs $1,290 (which is reduced to $990 if you register early). In addition, there is a one-time enrollment fee of $350.
11
With early enrollment, you would end up paying a total of $3,320. With regular enrollment, the total cost is $4,220.
Are the CFA Exams Multiple-Choice?
The CFA Level I exam is entirely multiple-choice, with 180 questions.
7
The Level II exam consists of 22 item sets and 88 multiple-choice questions.
8
Level III consists of 11 constructed response (essay) questions and 11 item sets.
9
Constructed response items typically have several parts related to a case study that describes one or a series of investment challenges.
Are CFA Charter Holders Paid More?
Industry reports indicate that CFA charter holders are paid more than those who have not completed the program. According to test prep provider 300Hours, a CFA charter holder earns, on average, 57% more than a Level I candidate when controlling for years of work experience.

Investopedia,"Transaction: Definition, Accounting, and Examples","Close
Definition
A transaction is the exchange of money between two or more parties for a product or service.
What Is a Transaction?
A transaction is a completed agreement between a buyer and a seller that involves an obligation to exchange goods, services, or financial assets in return for money.
The term is also commonly used in corporate accounting. In such a case, this straightforward definition can get tricky.
That's because a transaction may be recorded differently by a company depending on whether it uses
accrual accounting
or
cash accounting
.
Key Takeaways
Transactions can be a little tricky when it comes to corporate accounting.
Accrual accounting recognizes a transaction immediately after it is finalized, regardless of when payment is received or made.
Cash accounting is used mostly by smaller businesses and records a transaction only when money is received or paid out.
Third-party transactions can often complicate the process.
Understanding Transactions
A transaction between a buyer and a seller is relatively straightforward. Person A pays person B in exchange for a product or service.
When they agree on the terms, money is exchanged for the good or service and the transaction is complete.
Transactions can be more complex in the accounting world because businesses may make a deal today that won't be
settled
until a future date.
Or, they may have revenues or expenses that are known but not yet due.
Third-party transactions
can also complicate the process.
Whether a business records income and expense transactions using the accrual method of accounting or the cash method of accounting affects the company’s financial and tax reporting.
The accrual accounting method requires a transaction to be recorded when money is earned or the good/service is delivered, regardless of when the money is received or the expenses are paid.
The cash accounting method
records a transaction
only when the money is received or the expenses are paid. This may require a
letter of intent
or a memorandum of understanding.
1
Important
If a customer buys something on credit, it will immediately be recorded as a transaction if the company selling the good uses the accrual accounting method.
Transactions Using Accrual Accounting
With accrual accounting, a company records income when completing a service or delivering goods rather than when payment is received.
If an
inventory
is required when accounting for a company’s income and it has average
gross receipts
of over $26 million over the prior three years, the company will normally use the accrual method of accounting for sales and purchases.
2
Examples of Accrual Accounting
A company selling merchandise to a customer on store credit in October records the transaction immediately as an item in
accounts receivable (AR)
.
Even if the customer does not make a cash payment for the merchandise until December or pays in installments, the transaction is recorded as income in October.
The same goes for goods or services the company purchases.
Business expenses
are recorded when the products or services are received.
Supplies purchased on credit in April are recorded as expenses for April, even if the business does not make a cash payment on the supplies until May.
Transactions Using Cash Accounting
Most small businesses, especially
sole proprietorships
and
partnerships
, use the cash accounting method. With this method, income is recorded when payments are received from customers. Expenses are recorded when bills are paid.
Examples of Cash Accounting
Let's say a business sells $10,000 worth of widgets to a customer in March. The customer pays the invoice in April. The company recognizes the sale only after the cash is received in April.
Expenses are also only recorded when a payment is made. A business may purchase $500 of office supplies in May, for example, and pay for them in June. The business recognizes the purchase when it pays the bill in June.
For tax reasons, the cash basis of accounting is available only if a company has an average of less than $26 million over the prior three years in annual sales.
2
The cash basis is easier than the accrual basis for recording transactions because no complex accounting transactions, such as
accruals
and deferrals, are necessary.
Its drawback is that the profit of the business may vary wildly from month to month, at least on paper.
What Is an ACH Transaction?
An ACH transaction is an electronic payment made between banks. They are processed through the Automated Clearing House. Examples of ACH transactions include direct deposits for things like your salary or tax refund, and bill payments that are made online or through your bank.
3
How Do I Cancel a Pending Transaction?
To cancel a pending transaction, contact the merchant and/or your bank to request a reversal of the transaction.
Pending transactions are those that have been made but aren't posted to your account. These include payments, purchases, pre-authorized debits, and any other related transactions. Purchases made with a debit or credit card are held for a certain period of time before they work their way through the electronic system from your bank to the recipients. The transaction date is the day of the purchase or payment.
Posting a transaction to a credit card account
moves it from the pending category.
How Are Transactions Different in Accounting?
Accounting transactions are a little different because of the way they may be recorded. In the accrual method of accounting, transactions are recorded once the work has been completed and the goods or services delivered, regardless of whether payment has been made yet. But in the cash accounting method, transactions are recorded only when money is received or paid.
The Bottom Line
A transaction is a financial agreement between two or more parties where money is exchanged for goods or services. It's a financial agreement that is completed when the goods or services and money change hands.
The recording of transactions in accounting can vary, depending on whether the accrual or cash accounting method is used.

Investopedia,"Yield Maintenance: Definition, Formula, and How It Works","Close
What Is Yield Maintenance?
Yield maintenance is a sort of
prepayment penalty
that allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments up until the maturity date. It dictates that borrowers pay the
rate differential
between the loan interest rate and the prevailing market interest rate on the prepaid capital for the period remaining to loan maturity.
Yield maintenance premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to
prepayment
(the settlement of a debt or
installment loan
before its official due date). Furthermore, it makes refinancing unattractive and uneconomical to borrowers.
Key Takeaways
Yield maintenance is a kind of prepayment fee that borrowers pay to lenders, or bond issuers to investors, to compensate for the loss of interest resulting from the prepayment of a loan or the calling in of a bond.
Yield maintenance is intended to mitigate lenders' prepayment risk, or to discourage borrowers from settling their debts ahead of schedule.
The formula for calculating a yield maintenance premium is: Yield Maintenance = Present Value of Remaining Payments on the Mortgage x (Interest Rate - Treasury Yield).
Understanding Yield Maintenance
When a borrower obtains financing, either by issuing bonds or by taking out a loan (e.g., mortgage, auto loan, business loan, etc.), the lender is periodically paid interest as compensation for the use of their money for a period of time. The interest that is expected constitutes a rate of return for the lender who projects earnings based on the rate.
For example, an investor who purchases a 10-year bond with a $100,000
face value
and an annual
coupon rate
of 7%, intends to be credited annually by 7% x $100,000 = $7,000. Likewise, a bank that approves a $350,000 mortgage at a fixed interest rate expects to receive interest payments monthly until the borrower completes the mortgage payments years down the line.
However, there are situations in which the borrower pays off the loan early or calls in a bond prior to the maturity date. This threat of a premature return of the principal is known as
prepayment risk
(in financial lingo, ""prepayment"" means the settlement of a debt or
installment loan
before its official due date). Every debt instrument carries it, and every lender faces it, to some degree. The risk is that the lender won't get the interest income stream for as long a period as they counted on.
Important
The most common reason for loan prepayment is a drop in interest rates, which provides an opportunity for a borrower or bond issuer to refinance its debt at a lower interest rate.
To compensate lenders in the event that a borrower repays the loan earlier than scheduled, a
prepayment
fee or premium, known as yield maintenance, is charged. In effect, the yield maintenance allows the lender to earn its original yield without suffering any loss.
Yield maintenance is most common in the commercial mortgage industry. For example, let's imagine a building owner who's taken out a loan to buy an adjacent property. It's a 30-year mortgage, but five years in, interest rates have fallen considerably, and the owner decides to refinance. He borrows money from another lender and pays off his old mortgage. If the bank that issued that mortgage imposed a yield maintenance fee or premium, it would be able to reinvest the money returned to them, plus the penalty amount, in safe Treasury securities and receive the same cash flow as they would if they had received all scheduled loan payments for the entire duration of the loan.
How to Calculate Yield Maintenance
The formula for calculating a yield maintenance premium is:
YM
=
PV of RP on the Mortgage
×
(
IR
−
TY
)
where:
YM
=
Yield maintenance
PV
=
Present value
RP
=
Remaining payments
IR
=
Interest rate
TY
=
Treasury yield
The Present Value factor in the formula can be calculated as
1
−
(
1
+
r
)
−
n

2
r
where:
r
=
Treasury yield
n
=
Number of months
\begin{aligned}&\textbf{YM}=\textbf{PV of RP on the Mortgage}\times(\textbf{IR}-\textbf{TY})\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{YM}=\text{Yield maintenance}\\&\text{PV}=\text{Present value}\\&\text{RP}=\text{Remaining payments}\\&\text{IR}=\text{Interest rate}\\&\text{TY}=\text{Treasury yield}\\&\text{The Present Value factor in the formula can be calculated as }\frac{1-(1+r)^{-\frac{n}{12}}}{r}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&r=\text{Treasury yield}\\&n=\text{Number of months}\end{aligned}
​
YM
=
PV of RP on the Mortgage
×
(

TY
)
where:

PV
=

)
−

n
​
​
where:

n
=

​
For example, assume a borrower has a $60,000 balance remaining on a loan with 5% interest. The remaining term of the loan is exactly five years or 60 months. If the borrower decides to pay off the loan when the yield on 5-year Treasury notes drops to 3%, The yield maintenance can be calculated in this way.
Step 1: PV = [(1 – (1.03)
-60/12
)/0.03] x $60,000
PV = 4.58 x $60,000
PV = $274,782.43
Step 2: Yield Maintenance = $274,782.43 x (0.05 – 0.03)
Yield Maintenance = $274,782.43 x (0.05 – 0.03)
Yield Maintenance = $5,495.65
The borrower will have to pay an additional $5,495.65 to prepay his debt.
If
Treasury yields
go up from where they were when a loan was taken out, the lender can make a profit by accepting the early loan repayment amount and lending the money out at a higher rate or investing the money in higher-paying treasury bonds. In this case, there is no yield loss to the lender, but it will still charge a prepayment penalty on the principal balance.

What Is Joint Tenancy?
Joint tenancy is a legal form of property ownership where two or more individuals hold equal rights and obligations to a
property
. This arrangement can be made by married or unmarried couples, business partners, friends, or even family members.
A unique feature of joint tenancy is the
right of survivorship
. When one joint tenant dies, their share of the property automatically transfers to the surviving tenant(s), bypassing the
probate
process.
Key Takeaways
Joint tenancy means equal ownership and equal responsibilities among co-owners.
The right of survivorship allows a surviving tenant to inherit the property automatically after another tenant's death.
Joint tenancy differs from a tenancy in common, where a deceased tenant’s share goes to their heirs.
A joint tenancy can be dissolved unilaterally without other tenants' consent.
Investopedia / Zoe Hansen
How Joint Tenancy Works
Joint tenancy is a form of property ownership normally associated with
real estate
. It typically involves two or more individuals acquiring property simultaneously, such as purchasing a house. The legal
deed
that transfers ownership will list them as joint tenants.
Each joint tenant shares an equal interest in the property—both in terms of financial responsibility and benefits. If they decide to rent out the home to another individual or if they sell the property, each party is entitled to a 50% share in the
profits
. But the relationship also means they are equally responsible for paying for the property, including
mortgage payments
,
property taxes
, and maintenance. If one fails to live up to the financial obligations, the other party must assume responsibility.
Rights of Survivorship
One of the most significant advantages of joint tenancy is the
right of survivorship
. When a joint tenant passes away, their share of the property automatically passes to the surviving tenant(s), avoiding the lengthy probate process. This allows for seamless transfer of ownership without the need for court intervention.
Probate courts
decide the validity of a person's
will
and divide the assets appropriately among the deceased's
beneficiaries
.
Although joint tenancy is most closely associated with real estate ownership, the broader legal concept of
joint tenancy with the right of survivorship
can apply to various assets, including businesses and
brokerage accounts
.
1
A strong association with real estate exists because the term tenancy is seen as synonymous with owning or living in a home.
Important
The property does not need to go through the probate system since a joint tenancy creates a right of survivorship.
Creating Joint Tenancy
In most cases, four items must be present when creating a joint tenancy. Note that not all jurisdictions may require these, and in some cases, other requirements exist. The four concepts revolve around time, title, interest, and possession.
Time
The requirement of time usually indicates that all joint tenants must acquire their ownership interests in the property simultaneously. It does not necessarily mean that all joint tenants have to sign the same document at exactly the same moment, but they should obtain their interests in the property from the same event. For example, if two people purchase a property together and both names appear on the same deed with the same date, the unity of time is satisfied.
Note that changes to the ownership structure are common and natural as ownership progresses. For example, should those two people no longer fraternize, one may sever their ownership or be replaced by a new joint owner. Joint tenancy most often occurs naturally at the start of an ownership agreement, though it may change over time.
Title
Title
requires that all joint tenants acquire their ownership interests through the same legal instrument or document. In practical terms, this means that if two or more individuals are buying a property together, they should be listed as co-owners on the same deed or other appropriate legal documentation. For instance, if three individuals are named as joint tenants in a single deed transferring the property to them, joint tenancy is valid.
This requirement is critical in maintaining true ownership status. Should multiple ownership documents exist, it may be difficult or inefficient to correctly identify not only who owns a property but when their ownership took place. In addition, because joint owners have shared financial interests in a property, it is important that all joint owners are clearly defined in the event of financial distress.
Interest
Interest refers to a joint owner's apportionment of the property. Interest ensures that each joint tenant holds an equal and undivided share in the property. This means that all co-owners have the same percentage of
ownership
. For example, in a joint tenancy with two individuals, each joint tenant would have a 50% interest. In a joint tenancy with three individuals, each joint tenant would have a 33.33% interest, and so on.
There are other forms of legal ownership where owner interest is not necessarily fair or equal. In general, for most real estate transactions—unless otherwise explicitly stated and agreed to by all parties—each joint owner will share in equal interest.
Possession
Possession means that all joint tenants have an equal right to possess and use the entire property. It implies that no joint tenant can claim exclusive rights to any specific part of the property. Instead, all co-owners have the right to access and use the entire property as a whole.
This concept distinguishes joint tenancy from other forms of co-ownership, like tenancy in common, where each co-owner may have distinct, separate portions of the property. In addition, it solidifies the liability aspect of the property should something go wrong. For example, should substantial water damage occur in a single room, all joint owners are often liable to share in those costs (ignoring any explicit causes for damage or separate agreements).
Financial Implications of Joint Tenancy
Joint tenancy in property ownership involves quite several financial aspects. Joint tenants hold an equal share of the property, ensuring that all co-owners share equal financial burden and benefits. They also share property acquisition costs, such as down payments, closing costs, and associated expenses.
Post-close, joint owners are collectively responsible for
mortgage payments
and maintaining good credit standing. Property taxes are shared equally among all co-owners, regardless of individual contributions.
Maintenance and repairs
are also to be shared equally among joint owners, with decisions regarding repairs and improvements made jointly and expenses divided equally.
Income
derived from the property should be shared equally among all joint tenants based on ownership interest percentages. In addition, gains (and resulting capital gains taxes) may apply if the property is sold, with
tax implications
varying depending on local laws, ownership duration, and each joint tenant's share in the property.
Severing Joint Tenancy
Joint tenancy in property ownership can be severed through various methods. A voluntary agreement allows all joint tenants to terminate the joint tenancy and convert it into a tenancy in common, often through a written agreement or contract. Should all parties not agree, this voluntary agreement often experiences headwinds and may not be able to be fully executed.
Conveyance
involves transferring or selling a joint tenant's share of the property to a third party, who becomes a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenants. In some cases, the existing tenants may review or approve of the new owner (e.g., consider partial ownership of professional sports teams that must adhere to a rigid review process with strict ownership requirements).
Partition actions are legal proceedings that can be costly and time-consuming, and a court may order involuntary severance due to certain circumstances. This may arise due to a dispute or conflicting interests among the joint tenants.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Joint Tenancy
Although joint tenancy has a number of advantages, some distinct disadvantages should also be considered before entering into the arrangement.
Pros of Joint Tenancy
As mentioned earlier, as long as one joint tenant survives, it avoids the headaches of clearing the property through an
estate
via a will.
2
Typically, a person's will upon death goes through probate, which is a legal process whereby the courts review a will to validate it. Typically, when a person dies, their assets cannot be accessed or claimed by the survivor until probate releases them.
The probate process also helps determine how a deceased party's
assets
are distributed if the person doesn't name beneficiaries or has a will in place. However, the process can easily take months to sort out. A joint tenancy avoids probate and the lengthy legal process, allowing the joint tenant to take ownership of the assets immediately.
In addition to sharing the benefits of the property, all of the parties in a joint tenancy share responsibility for the property. For example, one ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/joint-tenancy.asp

A company's operating income is the profit it has earned after its operating expenses are deducted.
What Is Operating Income?
Operating income is the amount of profit that a company has realized after its operating expenses such as wages,
depreciation
, and
cost of goods sold
(COGS) are deducted.
The number for operating expenses includes all of the costs of manufacturing, selling, and distributing a product but excludes taxes, interest, and one-time expenses that can skew the numbers.
Operating income is calculated by taking the company's
gross income
, which is equivalent to its total revenue minus COGS, and subtracting all operating expenses.
Key Takeaways
Operating expenses are the normal costs of running a business and include not only manufacturing costs but overhead, sales, and administrative expenses.
Operating income is the same as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).
The number for net income reflects the costs of interest and taxes.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Operating Income
Operating income shows how much of a company's revenue
will eventually become profits
considering how much it costs to run the business.
Operating income factors in two major types of expenses: cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Cost of goods sold are the expenses directly related to manufacturing a product and include labor,
raw materials
, and overhead allocated to items sold. Operating expenses include selling, administrative, and general expenses.

Taxes, interest expenses, and big one-time expenses are not included in this formula because they might skew the numbers for profit or net income.
A company that's
generating an increasing amount of operating income
is looked on favorably. It means that the company's management is generating more revenue while controlling its expenses.
Operating Income Formulas and Calculations
Operating income can be calculated in three ways. One approach is top-down, one approach is a bottom-up approach, and one leverages cost accounting classifications.
Operating Income Formula: Top-Down Approach
The formula for operating income using the top-down approach is:
Operating Income
=
GP
−
OE
−
D
−
A
where:
GP
=
Gross profit
OE
=
Operating expenses
D
=
Depreciation
A
=
Amortization
\begin{aligned}&\text{Operating Income} = \text{GP} - \text{OE} - \text{D} - \text{A} \\&\textbf{where:} \\&\text{GP} = \text{Gross profit} \\&\text{OE} = \text{Operating expenses} \\&\text{D} = \text{Depreciation} \\&\text{A} = \text{Amortization} \\\end{aligned}
​
Operating Income
=
GP
−
OE
−
D
−
A
where:
GP
=
Gross profit
OE
=
Operating expenses
D
=
Depreciation
A
=
Amortization
​
Gross profit
is the net profit earned after the cost of goods sold is subtracted from net revenue. Operating expenses are the selling, administrative, and general expenses necessary to operate a business, though this does not include interest or taxes.
Because operating expenses do not incorporate allocated costs, depreciation and amortization must also be subtracted.
Operating Income Formula: Bottom-Up Approach
Instead of starting with revenue, you can calculate operating income starting with net income. Because net income is calculated by subtracting a few items from operating income, you add them back in to arrive at operating income:
Operating Income
=
NI
+
IE
+
TE
where:
NI
=
Net income
IE
=
Interest expense
TE
=
Tax expense
\begin{aligned}&\text{Operating Income} = \text{NI} + \text{IE} + \text{TE} \\&\textbf{where:} \\&\text{NI} = \text{Net income} \\&\text{IE} = \text{Interest expense} \\&\text{TE} = \text{Tax expense} \\\end{aligned}
​
Operating Income
=
NI
+
IE
+
TE
where:
NI
=
Net income
IE
=
Interest expense
TE
=
Tax expense
​
In this formula, you must have a fully calculated income statement, as net income is the last component listed on financial statements. In this case, the company may already be reporting operating income towards the bottom of the report.
Operating Income Formula: Cost Accounting Approach
Though
direct costs
and indirect costs are not widely used in financial accounting, a company may classify these types of expenses for internal use. If so, it can find operating income by simply subtracting all of these costs from net revenue (as taxes and interest are often not classified as either):
Operating Income
=
NR
−
DC
−
IC
where:
NR
=
Net revenue
DC
=
Direct costs
IC
=
Indirect costs
\begin{aligned}&\text{Operating Income} = \text{NR} - \text{DC} - \text{IC} \\&\textbf{where:} \\&\text{NR} = \text{Net revenue} \\&\text{DC} = \text{Direct costs} \\&\text{IC} = \text{Indirect costs} \\\end{aligned}
​
Operating Income
=
NR
−
DC
−
IC
where:
NR
=
Net revenue
DC
=
Direct costs
IC
=
Indirect costs
​
In this formula, net revenue is used in case there have been product returns or other deductions to make to gross revenue.
Important
Operating income is the amount of income a company generates from its core operations, meaning it excludes any
income and expenses not directly tied to the core business
.
Operating Income vs. Other Income Measures
A company's income is reported in various ways. In addition to operating income, the report may quote the company's numbers for gross revenue, net income, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), or EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization.
Operating Income vs. Revenue
When looking at a company's financial statements, revenue is often the highest level of financial reporting. Gross revenue is the total amount of money taken in by a company for a given period. Net revenue is gross revenue minus any discounts, returns, or deductions.
While revenue does not incorporate any expenses, operating income does. In fact, it incorporates almost every expense of a company.
Revenue shows how successful a company is at selling its product, but operating income is more useful. It shows how efficiently a company is spending its money to incur that revenue.
Operating Income vs. Net Income
Operating income is not the same as
net income
. Operating income includes most of the costs of doing business but it disregards other income, non-operating income, and non-operating expenses. Those figures are included in the net income calculation.
In almost all cases, operating income will be higher than net income because net income deducts more expenses. For this reason, net income is often the last line reported on an income statement while operating income is usually found a few lines above it.
Operating Income vs. EBIT and EBITDA
Operating income is similar or identical to
earnings before interest and taxes
(EBIT). EBIT is also referred to as the operating profit or recurring profit.
Both measurements calculate the amount of money a company earned less a few noncontrollable costs. Technically, EBIT may include other operating expenses outside of interest and taxes but for most companies, these two calculations will be the same.
Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA), on the other hand, will differ from operating income. EBITDA disregards the costs of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, resulting in a larger figure than operating income.
Fast Fact
If a company does not have interest expenses, tax expenses, or other non-operational costs, it is possible for a company's operating income to be the same as its net income.
Example of Operating Income
The image below represents Apple Inc.'s income statement for the three months ending March 29, 2025. It also records income for the same period in the previous year.
Apple, Inc. - Q3 2022 Income Statement.
On its income statement, Apple reported $95.359 billion of product and service revenue, up from $90.753 billion a year before. Looking further down its income statement, the company's operating income for the three-month period was $29.589, billion, up from $27.900 billion the year before.
The company's operating expenses grew to $15.278 billion from $14.371 billion in the previous period.
Its net income also grew, to $24.780 billion from $23.636 billion in the same period of 2024.
Is Operating Income the Same As Profits?
Not exactly. Operating income is what is left over after a company subtracts the cost of goods sold (COGS) and other operating expenses from the revenues it receives. However, it does not take into consideration taxes, intere",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp

A stock-keeping unit (SKU) is a label printed with a unique number and a scannable bar code, used by retailers to keep track of their inventory.
What Is a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU)?
A stock-keeping unit (SKU) is a sticker attached to a product that retailers use to keep track of their inventory. The sticker contains a unique series of digits and a scannable bar code that records the information when the item is sold.
The digits identify the product, its price, its manufacturer, and the point of sale. SKUs may also be applied to intangible but billable products such as units of labor in an auto body shop or
warranties
.
Key Takeaways
SKUs are used by retail stores, catalogs, service providers, warehouses, and product fulfillment centers.
Retailers rely on them to restock inventory as it is sold.
SKU data also allow vendors to see where an item is in the shipment process.
Scannable SKUs and a POS system make it easy for managers to determine which products need to be restocked.
Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi
Tracking Inventory
SKUs are used by stores, catalogs, e-commerce vendors, service providers, warehouses, and product fulfillment centers to
track inventory
levels.
When a customer buys an item at the
point-of-sale
(POS), the SKU is scanned and the POS system automatically removes the item from the inventory while recording other data such as the sale price.
Scannable SKUs and a POS system make it easy for managers to determine which products need to be restocked.
Important
SKUs are not model numbers, although the model number may be included in the identification code. Businesses create unique SKUs for the products they sell.
Vendor Benefits
Track Inventory
: SKUs allow vendors to see what they have in stock, track inventory movement, and provide information on
reorder points
.
Prepare for Sales or Seasons
: SKU data can help vendors decide what to reorder to prepare for holiday seasons or sales.
In Transit Data
:
SKUs carry data that allow vendors to see where an item is in the shipment process.

SKUs vs. UPCs
Because each company creates its own SKUs to track inventory, the SKUs for identical products vary among businesses.
This can make it more difficult for a consumer to compare prices among retailers. For example, if a company provides the SKU to advertise a certain discounted refrigerator, shoppers cannot use it to check the prices at the store's competitors.
Universal product codes
(UPCs) are identical regardless of which business sells the items, so they can be used for comparison purposes. The UPC label includes a barcode and a 12-digit number that identifies the product.
How Do I Distinguish an SKU From a UPC?
Both labels are attached to many products, and both contain barcodes and a series of identifying characters. The UPC will display 12 numbers (and no letters). The SKU usually has both numbers and alphabetical characters, and its length will vary.
The UPC identifies the product. The SKU identifies the product and its retailer.
How Are SKUs Used in E-Commerce?
People who sell their products through Web retailers can create and use unique SKUs to track sales and inventory. Amazon, for example, allows sellers to create SKUs for products they sell on the site.

What Does Economic Order Quantity Mean for Vendors?
The ideal quantity of units a company should purchase to meet demand and minimize inventory costs is called the
economic order quantity
(EOQ). Retailers set an EOQ to alert them when a product needs to be reordered.
The Bottom Line
Businesses need to track inventory to know how much they're selling, when they need to restock, and how fast products are selling. Using an SKU simplifies the inventory process, allowing some automation of inventory management.

What Is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) describes the relationship between
systematic risk
, or the general perils of investing, and
expected return
for assets, particularly stocks. It is a finance model that establishes a linear relationship between the required return on an investment and risk.
CAPM is based on the relationship between an asset’s
beta
, the
risk-free rate
(typically the
Treasury bill
rate), and the
equity risk premium
, or the expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate.
CAPM evolved as a way to measure this systematic risk. It is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky
securities
and generating expected returns for assets, given the risk of those assets and
cost of capital
.
Key Takeaways
The capital asset pricing model, or CAPM, is a financial model that calculates the expected rate of return for an asset or investment.
CAPM does this by using the expected return on both the market and a risk-free asset, and the asset’s correlation or sensitivity to the market (beta).
There are some limitations to the CAPM, such as making unrealistic assumptions and relying on a linear interpretation of risk vs. return.
Despite its issues, the CAPM formula is still widely used because it is simple and allows for easy comparisons of investment alternatives.
For instance, it is used in conjunction with modern portfolio theory (MPT) to understand portfolio risk and expected return.

asset

\begin{aligned} &ER_i = R_f + \beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &ER_i = \text{expected return of investment} \\ &R_f = \text{risk-free rate} \\ &\beta_i = \text{beta of the investment} \\ &(ER_m - R_f) = \text{market risk premium} \\ \end{aligned}

​
Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the
time value of money
. The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for the
investor
taking on additional risk.
The
goal of the CAPM formula
is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared with its expected return. In other words, by knowing the individual parts of the CAPM, it is possible to gauge whether the
current price
of a stock is consistent with its likely return.

Important
The CAPM seeks to gauge whether a stock's current price is consistent with its likely return.
CAPM and Beta
Beta compares a security or portfolio's volatility or systematic risk to the market. If a
stock
is riskier than the market, it will have a beta greater than one. If a stock has a beta of less than one, the formula assumes it will reduce the risk of a
portfolio
.
A stock’s beta is then multiplied by the
market risk premium
, which is the return expected from the market above the risk-free rate. The
risk-free rate
is then added to the product of the stock’s beta and the market risk premium. The result should give an investor the
required return
or
discount rate
that they can use to find the value of an asset.
CAPM Example
Imagine an investor is contemplating a stock valued at $100 per
share
today that pays a 3% annual
dividend
. Say this stock has a beta compared with the market of 1.3, which means it is more volatile than a broad market portfolio (i.e., the S&P 500 Index). Also, assume that the risk-free rate is 3% and this investor expects the market to rise in value by 8% per year.
The expected return of the stock based on the CAPM formula is 9.5%:

%
=
3
%
+
1
.
3
×
(

%
−

%
)
​
The expected return of the CAPM formula is used to discount the expected dividends and
capital appreciation
of the stock over the expected holding period. If the discounted value of those future cash flows is equal to $100, then the CAPM formula indicates the stock is fairly valued relative to risk.
Problems With the CAPM
Unrealistic Assumptions
Several assumptions behind the CAPM formula have been shown not to hold up in reality. Modern financial theory rests on two assumptions:
Securities markets are very competitive and efficient (that is, relevant information about the companies is quickly and universally distributed and absorbed).
These markets are dominated by rational, risk-averse investors, who seek to maximize satisfaction from
returns on their investments
.
As a result, it’s not entirely clear whether CAPM works. The big sticking point is beta. When professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French looked at share returns on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
, the
American Stock Exchange (AMEX)
, and
Nasdaq
, they found that differences in betas over a lengthy period did not explain the performance of different stocks. The linear relationship between beta and individual stock returns also breaks down over shorter periods of time. These findings seem to suggest that CAPM may be wrong.
2
Including beta in the formula assumes that risk can be measured by a stock’s price
volatility
. However, price movements in both directions are not equally risky. The look-back period to determine a stock’s volatility is not standard because stock returns (and risk) are not
normally distributed
.
The CAPM also assumes that the risk-free rate will remain constant over the discounting period. Assume in the previous example that the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds rose to 5% or 6% during the 10-year holding period. An increase in the risk-free rate also increases the cost of the capital used in the investment and could make the stock look
overvalued
.
1960s
The period when the CAPM was conceived.
2
Estimating the Risk Premium
The market portfolio used to find the market risk premium is only a theoretical value and is not an asset that can be purchased or invested in as an alternative to the stock. Most of the time, investors will use a major stock index, like the
S&P 500
, to substitute for the market, which is an imperfect comparison.
The most serious critique of the CAPM is the assumption that future cash flows can be estimated for the discounting process. If an investor could estimate the future return of a stock with a high level of accuracy, then the CAPM would not be necessary.
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier
Using the CAPM to build a portfolio is supposed to help an investor manage their risk. If an investor were able to use the CAPM to perfectly optimize a portfolio’s return relative to risk, it would exist on a curve called the
efficient frontier
, as shown in the following graph.
Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2022
The graph shows how greater expected returns (y axis) require greater expected risk (x axis).
Modern portfolio theory (MPT)
suggests that starting with the risk-free rate, the expected return of a portfolio increases as the risk increases. Any portfolio that fits on the
capital market line (CML)
is better than any possible portfolio to the right of that line, but, at some point, a theoretical portfolio can be constructed on the CML with the best return for the amount of risk being taken.
The CML and the efficient frontier may be difficult to define, but they illustrate an important concept for investors: There is a tradeoff between increased return and increased risk. Because it isn’t possible to perfectly build a portfolio that fits on the CML, it is more common for investors to take on too much risk as they seek additional return.
In the following chart, you can see two portfolios that have been constructed to fit along the efficient frontier. Portfolio A is expected to return 8% per year and has a 10%
standard deviation
or risk level. Portfolio B is expected to return 10% per year but has a 16% standard deviation. The risk of Portfolio B rose fas",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp

What Is the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)?
Equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life. Firms often use EAC for capital budgeting decisions, as it allows a company to compare the cost-effectiveness of various assets with unequal lifespans in a process known as the
replacement chain method
.
Key Takeaways

EAC allows managers to compare the net present values of different projects over different periods, to accurately determine the best option.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
Understanding the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)
Equivalent annual cost (EAC) is used for a variety of purposes, including capital budgeting. But it is used most often to analyze two or more possible projects with different lifespans, where costs are the most relevant variable.
Other uses of EAC include calculating the optimal life of an asset, determining if leasing or purchasing an asset is the better option, determining the magnitude of which maintenance costs will impact an asset, determining the necessary cost savings to support purchasing a new asset, and determining the cost of keeping existing equipment.
The EAC calculation factors in a discount rate or the cost of capital.
Cost of capital
is the required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project—such as building a new factory—worthwhile. Cost of capital includes the cost of debt and the cost of equity and is used by companies internally to judge whether a capital project is worth the expenditure of resources.

How to Calculate the Equivalent Annual Cost
Take the asset price or cost and multiply it by the discount rate.
The discount rate is also called the
cost of capital,
which is the required return necessary to make a
capital budgeting
project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile.
In the denominator add 1 + the discount rate and raise the result as an exponent to the number of years for the project. Subtract the result by 1 and divide the numerator figure by the denominator.
Many financial online calculators are available to calculate EAC.
Example of the Equivalent Annual Cost
As stated earlier, EAC allows managers to compare NPVs of different projects over different periods, to accurately determine the best option. Consider two alternative investments in machinery equipment:
1. Machine A has the following:
An initial capital outlay of $105,000
An expected lifespan of three years
An annual maintenance expense of $11,000
2. Machine B has the following:
An initial capital outlay of $175,000
An expected lifespan of five years
An annual maintenance expense of $8,500
The cost of capital for the company making the decision is 5%.
Next, we calculate the EAC, which is equal to the
net present value
(NPV) divided by the present value annuity factor or A(t,r), while taking into account the cost of capital or r, and the number of years in question or t.
The annuity factor is calculated as follows:
Annuity Factor

(

)

where:
r
=
Cost of capital

\begin{aligned} &\text{Annuity Factor} = \frac{ 1 - \frac{ 1 }{ ( 1 + r ) ^ t} }{ r } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &r = \text{Cost of capital} \\ &t = \text{Number of periods} \\ \end{aligned}

where:

By standardizing the annual cost, a manager in charge of a capital budgeting decision where cost is the only issue would select Machine B because it has an EAC that is $636 lower than Machine A.
The Difference Between the Equivalent Annual Cost and the Whole-life Cost
Whole-life cost
is the total expense of owning an asset over its entire life, from purchase to disposal, as determined by financial analysis. It is also known as a ""life-cycle"" cost, which includes purchase and installation, design and building costs, operating costs, maintenance, associated financing costs, depreciation, and disposal costs.
Whole-life cost also takes into account certain costs that are usually overlooked, such as those related to environmental and social impact factors.
The equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annual cost of owning, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire life while the whole life cost is the total cost of the asset over its entire life.
Limitations of Using the Equivalent Annual Cost
A limitation with EAC, as with
many capital budgeting decisions
, is that the discount rate or cost of capital must be estimated for each project. Unfortunately, the forecast can turn out to be inaccurate, or variables can change over the life of the project or life of the asset that's be considered.

Investopedia,What Is Yield To Call? Definition and How It's Calculated,"Close
What Is Yield To Call?
Yield to call (YTC) is the return that a bondholder will be paid if the bond is held until the call date, which will occur sometime before the bond reaches maturity.
Yield to call applies to
callable bonds
, a type of bond that allows the investor to redeem the bond or the bond issuer to repurchase it on the call date, at a price known as the call price. By definition, the call date of a bond occurs before the
maturity date
.
This number can be mathematically calculated as the compound interest rate at which the present value of a bond's future coupon payments and call price is equal to the current market price of the bond.
Generally speaking, bonds are callable over several years. They are normally called at a slight premium above their face value, though the exact
call price
is based on prevailing market rates.
Key Takeaways
Yield to call applies to callable bonds, which are securities that allow the investors to redeem the bonds or the bond issuer to repurchase them before the bonds reach maturity.
Yield to call can be mathematically calculated, using computer programs.
A bond issuer might call a bond if interest rates change, making it more cost-effective to replace the bond with a new issue that has more favorable terms.
An investor would call a bond to cash it in and reinvest or use the principal.
Understanding Yield To Call
Many bonds are callable, including municipal bonds and bonds issued by corporations. If interest rates fall, the company or municipality that issued the bond might opt to pay off the outstanding debt and get new financing at a lower cost.
1
Calculating the yield to call on such bonds is important because it reveals the rate of return the investor will receive, assuming:
The bond is called on the earliest possible date
The bond is purchased at the current market price
The bond is held until the call date
2
Important
The yield to call is widely deemed to be a more accurate estimate of expected return on a bond than the
yield to maturity
.
Calculating Yield To Call
Although the formula used to calculate the yield to call is quite straightforward.
The complete formula to calculate yield to call is:
P = (C / 2) x {(1 - (1 + YTC / 2) ^ -2t) / (YTC / 2)} + (CP / (1 + YTC / 2) ^ 2t)
Where:
P = the current market price
C = the annual
coupon
payment
CP = the call price
t = the number of years remaining until the call date
YTC = the yield to call
Based on this formula, the yield to call cannot be solved directly. An iterative process must be used to find the yield to call if the calculation is being done by hand. Fortunately, many software programs have a ""solve for"" function that's capable of calculating such values with a click of the mouse.
Yield To Call Example
As an example, consider a callable bond that has a
face value
of $1,000 and pays a semiannual coupon of 10%. The bond is currently priced at $1,175 and has the option to be called at $1,100 five years from now. Note that the remaining years until maturity does not matter for this calculation.
Using the above formula, the calculation would be set up as:
$1,175 = ($100 / 2) x {(1- (1 + YTC / 2) ^ -2(5)) / (YTC / 2)} + ($1,100 / (1 + YTC / 2) ^ 2(5))
Through an iterative process, it can be determined that the yield to call on this bond is 7.43%.
Are Callable Bonds Better than Non-Callable Bonds?
Non-callable bonds are preferred by some investors because the issuer is locked into the return until the bond reaches its maturity date. For the same reason, non-callable bonds tend to pay a little less interest than callable bonds. The issuer is taking the risk that a change in interest rates will force it to pay more interest than necessary for the loan.
Are Most Bonds Callable?
Most corporate bonds and municipal bonds are callable. Most U.S. Treasury bonds and notes are non-callable.
What Happens to Callable Bonds When Interest Rates Rise?
The issuer of a bond is less likely to call the bond when interest rates rise. The issuer is unlikely to get a better deal by replacing it.
When interest rates decline, the issuer is more likely to call the bond in order to replace it.
The Bottom Line
If you invest in callable bonds, you need to know its yield to maturity, but it is perhaps more important to know its yield to call. Yield to call is the return you will get if the issuer decides to essentially cancel the issue and pay off investors early.
If you want real assurance that you'll get the yield to maturity that you expect, consider investing in non-callable bonds. They pay a bit less than callable bonds but you'll be certain to get the income you expect from them.

Investopedia,Weighted Average: Definition and How It Is Calculated and Used,"Close
What Is a Weighted Average?
A weighted average is a calculation that assigns varying degrees of importance to the numbers in a particular data set. A weighted average can be more accurate than a simple average in which all numbers in a data set are assigned an identical weight. It is widely used in investing and many other fields.
Key Takeaways
The weighted average accounts for the relative importance or frequency of some factors in a data set.
In a weighted average, each data point value is multiplied by the assigned weight, which is then summed and divided by the total number of data points.
Stock investors use a weighted average to establish the cost basis of shares they bought at different times and different prices.
A weighted average is sometimes more accurate than a simple average, although it is also introduces subjectivity into the equation.

What Is the Purpose of a Weighted Average?
In calculating a simple average, or
arithmetic mean
, all numbers are treated equally and assigned equal weight. But a weighted average assigns weights that determine in advance the relative importance of each data point. In calculating a weighted average, each number in the data set is multiplied by a predetermined weight before the final calculation is made.
A weighted average is most often computed to equalize the frequency of the values in a data set. For example, a voter survey might gather enough responses to be considered statistically valid, but the 18-to-34 age group may have fewer respondents than other groups relative to their share of the
population
. The survey team could weight the results of the 18-to-34 age group so that their views are represented proportionately.
However, values in a data set may be
weighted
for other reasons than the frequency of occurrence. For example, if students in a dance class are graded on skill, attendance, and manners, the grade for skill may be given greater weight than the other factors.

Each data point value in a weighted average is multiplied by the assigned weight, which is then summed and divided by the number of data points. The final average number reflects the relative importance of each observation and is thus more descriptive than a simple average. It also has the effect of smoothing out the data and enhancing its accuracy.
Here is a simple example involving just three data points:

Weighting a Stock Portfolio
Investors
often build a position in a particular stock over a number of years and at a variety of different prices. That makes it tough to keep track of the
cost basis
of those shares for tax and other purposes.
The investor can calculate a weighted average by multiplying the number of shares acquired at each price by that price, adding those values, then dividing the total value by the total number of shares.
For example, say an investor acquires 100 shares of a company in year one at $10 per share, and 50 shares of the same stock in year two at $40 per share. To get a weighted average of the price paid, the investor multiplies 100 shares by $10 for year one and 50 shares by $40 for year two, then adds the results to get a total of $3,000. Next, the total amount paid for the shares, $3,000 in this case, is divided by the number of shares acquired over both years, 150, to get the weighted average price paid of $20.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Weighted Average
Pros of Weighted Average
Weighted average can provide a more accurate representation of data when different values within a dataset hold varying degrees of importance. By assigning weights to each value based on their significance, weighted averages ensure that more weight is given to data points that have a greater impact on the overall result. This allows for a more nuanced analysis and decision-making process.
Next, weighted averages are particularly useful for handling skewed distributions or outliers within a dataset. Instead of being overly influenced by extreme values, weighted averages take into account the relative importance of each data point. This means you can ""manipulate"" your data set so it's more relevant, especially when you don't want to consider extreme values.
Thirdly, weighted averages offer flexibility in their application across various fields and disciplines. Whether in finance, statistics, engineering, or manufacturing, weighted averages can be customized to suit specific needs and objectives.
Note
The weighted average is sometimes also called the weighted mean.
Cons of Weighted Average
One downside of a weighted average is the potential for subjectivity in determining the weights assigned to each data point. This subjectivity can introduce
bias
into the analysis and undermine the reliability of the weighted average.
Weighted averages may also be sensitive to changes in the underlying data or weighting scheme. Small variations in the weights or input values can lead to significant fluctuations in the calculated average, making the results less stable and harder to interpret. This sensitivity can be particularly problematic in scenarios where the weights are based on uncertain or volatile factors, which may include human emotion. A good question to ask is: Are you confident you'll feel the same about the appropriate weights over time?
Last, the interpretation of weighted averages can be more complex compared to simple arithmetic means. Though weighted averages provide a single summary statistic, they may make it tough to understand the full scope of the relationship across data points. Therefore, it's essential to carefully assess how the weights are assigned and make sure that the values are clearly communicated to those who interpret the results.
Pros
Can allow for more accurate representation of data and more nuanced analysis.
Handles outliers, mitigating extreme value influence for relevance.
Flexible across different fields and can be tailored as needed.
Cons
Subjectivity in determining weights can introduces bias and undermine reliability.
Sensitivity to changes in data or weighting scheme affects stability.
Adds complexity compared to arithmetic mean, potentially complicating analysis.
Examples of Weighted Averages
Weighted averages are used in many areas of finance and business besides the purchase price of shares, including
portfolio returns
, inventory accounting, and valuation. When a mutual fund that holds multiple securities is up 10% on the year, that 10% represents a weighted average of returns for the fund with respect to the value of each position in the fund.
For inventory accounting, the weighted average value of inventory accounts for fluctuations in commodity prices, for example, while the
LIFO (last in, first out)
or
FIFO (first in, first out)
methods give more importance to time than value.
1
When evaluating companies to discern whether their shares are correctly priced, investors can use the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
to discount a company's cash flows. WACC is weighted based on the market value of debt and equity in a company's
capital structure
.
2
Weighted Average vs. Arithmetic vs. Geometric
Weighted averages provide a tailored solution for scenarios where certain data points hold more significance than others. However, there are other ways of calculating averages, some of which were mentioned earlier. The two main alternatives are the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.
Arithmetic means, or simple averages, are the simplest form of averaging and are widely used because of their ease of calculation and interpretation. They assume that all data points are of equal importance and are suitable for symmetrical distributions without significant outliers. Arithmetic means are easier to calculate since you simply divide the sum of the total by the number of instances. However, this method is much less nuanced and does not allow for much flexibility.
The
geometric mean
offers a specialized solution for scenarios involving exponential growth or decline. By taking the nth root of the product of n values, geometric means give equal weight to the relative percentage changes between values. This makes them particularly useful in finance for calculating compound interest rates or in epidemiology for analyzing disease spread rates.

What Is Weighted Average?
A weighted average is a statistical measure that assigns different weights to individual data points based on their relative significance, ideally resulting in a more accurate representation of the overall data set. It is calculated by multiplying each data point by its corresponding weight, summing the products, and dividing by the sum of the weights.
Is Weighted Average Better?
Whether a weighted average is better depends on the specific context and the objectives of your analysis. Weighted averages are better when different data points have varying degrees of importance, allowing you to have a more nuanced representation of the data. However, they may introduce subjectivity in determining weights and can be sensitive to changes in the weighting scheme.
How Does a Weighted Average Differ From a Simple Average?
A weighted average accounts for the relative contribution, or weight, of the things being averaged, while a simple average does not.
What Are Some Examples of Weighted Averages Used in Finance?
Many weighted averages are found in finance, including the
volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
, the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
, and
exponential moving averages (EMAs)
used in charting.

Definition
The Great Depression was the deepest and longest economic contraction in U.S. history.
What Was the Great Depression?
The Great Depression was a devastating and prolonged economic recession that followed the crash of the United States stock market in 1929. It lasted through 1941, the same year that the U.S. entered World War II.
The period was marked by several economic contractions, including the stock market crash of 1929, banking panics in 1930 and 1931. and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff that crashed world trade. Other events and policies helped to prolong the Depression during the 1930s.
Economists and historians often cite the Great Depression as the most significant, if not the most catastrophic, economic event of the 20th century.
Key Takeaways
The Great Depression was the greatest and most prolonged economic recession in modern world history.
The Depression ran from 1929 to 1941.
Investing in the speculative market in the 1920s led to the stock market crash of 1929, wiping out a great deal of nominal wealth.
Other factors also contributed to the Great Depression, including the Fed's inactivity, followed by its overreaction.
Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both tried to mitigate the impact of the Depression with government policies.
Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang
Important
It's hard to pinpoint exactly what caused the Great Depression, but economists and historians generally agree that several factors led to this period of downturn. They include the stock market crash of 1929, the gold standard, a drop in lending, tariffs, banking panics, and contractionary monetary policies of the Fed.
The 1929 Stock Market Crash
The U.S. stock market fell by nearly 50%, and corporate profits declined by over 90% during a short depression known as the Forgotten Depression that lasted from 1920 to 1921. The U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth during the rest of the decade. The American public discovered the stock market and dove in headfirst during the Roaring Twenties period.
1
Speculative frenzies affected both the real estate markets and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Loose money supply and high levels of margin trading by investors helped fuel an unprecedented increase in asset prices.

The lead-up to October 1929 saw equity prices rise to all-time high multiples of more than 19 times after-tax corporate earnings. Coupled with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA) increasing 500% in just five years, the stock market crash that followed was severe.
3
The NYSE bubble burst violently on Oct. 24, 1929, a day that has come to be known as
Black Thursday
.
4
A brief rally occurred on Friday the 25th and during a half-day session on Saturday the 26th, but the following week brought Black Monday (Oct. 28) and Black Tuesday (Oct. 29). The DJIA fell by more than 20% over those two days.
5
The stock market would eventually fall almost 90% from its 1929 peak.
3
Ripples from the crash spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe, triggering other financial crises such as the collapse of the Boden-Kredit Anstalt, Austria’s most important bank. The economic calamity hit both continents in full force in 1931.
6
The U.S. Economy Tailspin
The 1929 stock market crash wiped out
nominal
wealth, both corporate and private, and this sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.2% in early 1929. It soared to over 24% by 1933.
7
8
The unemployment rate remained above 18.9% in 1938 despite unprecedented interventions and government spending by both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations.
The stock market crash likely triggered the decade-long economic downturn, but most historians and economists agree that it didn't cause the Great Depression by itself. Nor does it explain why the slump's depth and persistence were so severe. A variety of specific events and policies contributed to the Great Depression and helped to prolong it during the 1930s.
Mistakes by the Young Federal Reserve
The relatively new Federal Reserve mismanaged the supply of money and credit before and after the crash in 1929, according to monetarists such as
Milton Friedman
and acknowledged by former Federal Reserve Chair
Ben Bernanke
.
9
The Fed was created in 1913, and it remained fairly inactive throughout the first eight years of its existence. Then it allowed significant monetary expansion after the economy recovered from the 1920 to 1921 depression.
10
The total money supply grew by $28 billion, a 61.8% increase between 1921 and 1928.
11
Bank deposits increased by 51.1%, savings and loan shares rose by 224.3%, and net life insurance policy reserves jumped by 113.8%. All this occurred after the Federal Reserve cut required reserves to 3% in 1917. Gains in gold reserves via the Treasury and Fed were only $1.16 billion.
12
The Fed instigated the rapid expansion that preceded the collapse by increasing the money supply and keeping the federal funds interest rate low during the decade. Much of the surplus money supply growth inflated the stock market and real estate bubbles.
The Fed took the opposite course by cutting the money supply by nearly a third after the bubbles burst and the market crashed. This reduction caused severe liquidity problems for many small banks and choked off hopes for a quick recovery.
Fast Fact
World War II created international trading channels and reversed burdensome price and wage controls, which helped the country recover from the Great Depression.
The Fed's Tight Fist
As Bernanke noted in a November 2002 address, before the Fed existed, bank panics were typically resolved within weeks. Large private financial institutions would loan money to the strongest smaller institutions to maintain system integrity.
9
That sort of scenario had occurred two decades earlier during the
Panic of 1907
.
At that time, investment banker J.P. Morgan stepped in to rally Wall Street denizens to move significant amounts of capital to banks that were lacking funds when frenzied selling sent the NYSE spiraling downward and led to a bank run.
13
Ironically, it was that panic that led the government to create the Federal Reserve to cut its reliance on individual financiers such as Morgan.
The heads of several New York banks had tried to instill confidence after Black Thursday by prominently purchasing stocks and encouraging others to do so. These actions caused a brief rally on Friday, but the panicked sell-offs resumed on Monday. The stock market has grown beyond the ability of such individual efforts in the decades since 1907. Only the Fed was big enough to prop up the U.S. financial system.
5
The Fed failed to do so, providing no cash injection between 1929 and 1932. Instead, it watched the money supply collapse and let thousands of banks fail. This and a collapsing financial sector led to deflation and spurred the following depression. Banking laws at the time made it very difficult for institutions to grow and diversify enough to survive a massive withdrawal of deposits.
The Fed's harsh reaction may have been the result of its fear that bailing out careless banks would encourage fiscal irresponsibility in the future. Some historians argue that the Fed created the conditions that caused the economy to overheat and then exacerbated an already dire economic situation.
Hoover's Propped-Up Prices
Herbert Hoover has often been characterized as a do-nothing president, but he took action after the crash occurred. He implemented three major changes between 1930 and 1932:
An increase in federal spending by 42% that resulted in massive public works programs such as the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)
14
Taxes to pay for new programs
A ban on immigration in 1930 to keep low-skilled workers from flooding the labor market
15
Hoover was mainly concerned that wages would be cut following the economic downturn. He reasoned that prices had to stay high to ensure high paychecks in all industries. Consumers would have to pay more to keep prices high.
But the public was burned badly in the crash, leaving many people without the resources to spend lavishly on goods and services. Nor could companies count on overseas trade because foreign nations weren't willing to buy overpriced American goods any more than Americans were.

Definition
Days payable outstanding (DPO) measures how many days it takes a company to pay its obligations.
What Is Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)?
Days payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time (in days) that a company takes to pay its bills and invoices to its trade creditors, which may include suppliers, vendors, or financiers. The ratio is typically calculated on a quarterly or annual basis, and it indicates how well the company’s cash outflows are being managed.
A company with a higher value of DPO takes longer to pay its bills, which means that it can retain available funds for a longer duration, allowing the company an opportunity to use those funds in a better way to maximize the benefits. A high DPO, however, may also be a red flag that indicates an inability to pay its bills on time.
Key Takeaways
Days payable outstanding (DPO) is a ratio used to figure out how long it takes a company, on average, to pay its bills and invoices.
Companies that have a high DPO can delay making payments and use the available cash for short-term investments as well as to increase their working capital and free cash flow.
However, higher values of DPO, though desirable, may not always be a positive for the business, as it may signal a cash shortfall and inability to pay.
DPO often varies by industry or company size, as larger companies often have more negotiation power to delay when payments are due.
DPO is a turnover ratio that calculates how efficiently a company is operating and using resources.

How to Calculate DPO
Accounts payable (AP)
represents how much money the company owes to its supplier(s) for purchases made on credit.
Additionally, there is the
cost of goods sold (COGS)
, which is defined as the cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products that a company sells during a period. This may include payment for utilities and employee wages.

Both of these figures represent cash outflows and are used in calculating DPO over a period of time.
The number of days in the corresponding period is usually taken as 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter. The formula takes account of the average per day cost being borne by the company for manufacturing a product. The numerator figure represents payments outstanding. The net factor gives the average number of days taken by the company to pay off its obligations after receiving the bills.
Two different versions of the DPO formula are used depending upon the accounting practices. In one of the versions, the accounts payable amount is taken as the figure reported at the end of the accounting period, like “at the end of fiscal year/quarter ending September 30.” This version represents the DPO value as of the mentioned date.
In another version, the average value of beginning AP and ending AP is taken, and the resulting figure represents the DPO value during that particular period.
COGS remains the same in both versions.
Important
DPO is a turnover ratio that measures the efficiency of a company.
What Does DPO Tell You?
Generally, a company acquires inventory, utilities, and other necessary services on credit. It results in accounts payable, a key accounting entry that represents a company's obligation to pay off the short-term liabilities to its creditors or suppliers. Beyond the actual dollar amount to be paid, the timing of the payments
—
from the date of receiving the bill till the cash actually going out of the company’s account
—
also becomes an important aspect of the business. DPO attempts to measure this average time cycle for outward payments and is calculated by taking the standard accounting figures into consideration over a specified period of time.
Additionally, a company may need to balance its outflow tenure with that of the inflow. Imagine if a company allows a 90-day period for its customers to pay for the goods they purchase but has only a 30-day window to pay its suppliers and vendors. This mismatch will result in the company being prone to cash crunch frequently. Companies must strike a delicate balance with DPO.
High DPO
Companies having high DPO can use the available cash for short-term investments and to increase their
working capital
and
free cash flow (FCF)
.
However, higher values of DPO may not always be a positive for the business. If the company takes too long to pay its creditors, it risks jeopardizing its relations with the suppliers and creditors who may refuse to offer the trade credit in the future or may offer it on terms that may be less favorable to the company. The company may also be losing out on any discounts on timely payments, if available, and it may be paying more than necessary.
Low DPO
A low DPO indicates that a company is paying its bills to suppliers quickly, which may suggest that the company is managing its cash flow effectively. A low DPO is considered to be a positive sign for a company's financial health, as it shows that the company is able to pay its bills in a timely manner. This also helps maintain good relationship with suppliers.
However, a low DPO may also indicate that the company is not taking advantage of the time to earn interest on its funds. For example, a company may be extended a payment period of 30 days. If it usually pays invoices after 10 days, the company could have been earning interest on the funds for an additional 20 days before remitting payment.
Important
A high DPO can indicate that a company is using capital resourcefully, but it can also show that the company is struggling to pay its creditors.
Special Considerations
Depending on various global and local factors, like the overall performance of the economy, region, and sector, plus any applicable seasonal impacts, the DPO value of a particular company can vary significantly from year to year, company to company, and industry to industry.
Because typical DPO values vary so widely across different industry sectors, analysts only compare DPO among firms of a particular sector. A firm's management can compare its DPO to the average within its industry to see if it is paying its vendors too quickly or too slowly.
DPO value also forms an integral part of the formula used for calculating the
cash conversion cycle (CCC)
, another key metric that expresses the length of time that a company takes to convert the resource inputs into realized cash flows from sales. While DPO focuses on the current outstanding payable by the business, the superset CCC follows the entire cash time-cycle as the cash is first converted into inventory, expenses, and accounts payable, through to sales and accounts receivable, and then back into cash in hand when received.
How to Improve DPO
Companies often want a high DPO as long as it doesn't indicate an inability to make payments. To achieve this, a company can negotiate with its suppliers to extend payment terms. If a company really prioritizes maximizing its DPO, it can decline to take advantage of early payment discounts.
By using electronic payment systems, a company can streamline its payment processes and make payments more quickly and efficiently. This means that instead of issuing slower means of payment such as a check that may have to be processed and mailed early in order for it to be received in time, a company can issue electronic payments the instant something is due.
If a company wants to decrease its DPO, it can regularly monitor its accounts payable to identify and resolve any issues that may be delaying payment to suppliers. A company can also more quickly resolve supplier payment problems if it has accurate and up-to-date records.

What Is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)?
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures. The
FDIC was created
in 1933 to maintain public confidence and encourage stability in the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices.
1
As of 2023, the FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor as long as the institution is a member firm. It is
critical for consumers to confirm
whether their institution is FDIC-insured.

Key Takeaways
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures.
The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, as long as the institution is a member firm.
The FDIC covers checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts, IRAs, revocable and irrevocable trust accounts, and employee benefit plans.
3
Mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies, stocks, and bonds aren't covered by the FDIC.
2
The primary purpose of the FDIC is to prevent ""run-on-the-bank"" scenarios, which devastated many banks during the
Great Depression
. For example, with the threat of the closure of a bank, small groups of worried customers rushed to withdraw their money in those years.
After fears spread, a stampede of customers, seeking to do the same, ultimately resulted in banks being unable to support withdrawal requests. Those who were first to withdraw their money from a troubled bank would benefit, whereas those who waited risked losing their savings overnight. Before the FDIC, there was no guarantee for the safety of
deposits
beyond the confidence in the bank's stability.
Understanding the FDIC
Because practically all banks and thrifts now offer FDIC coverage, many consumers face less uncertainty regarding their deposits. As a result, banks have a better opportunity to address problems under controlled circumstances without triggering a run on the bank.

In case of
bank failure
, the FDIC covers deposits up to $250,000, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category such as
retirement accounts
and trusts. This sum is adequate for the majority of depositors, though depositors with more than that sum should
spread their assets among multiple banks
.
Example 1:
If you have $200,000 in a savings account and $100,000 in a
certificate of deposit (CD)
, you have $50,000 uninsured.
Example 2:
If a couple has $500,000 in a joint account, as well as $250,000 in an eligible retirement account, the entire $750,000 would be covered by the FDIC, as each co-owner's share in the joint account is covered, and the retirement account is a different account category.
The FDIC provides a
helpful interactive tool
to check whether assets are covered.
What the FDIC Covers
Checking accounts, savings accounts, CDs, and
money market accounts
are generally 100%-covered by the FDIC. Coverage extends to
individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
, but only the parts that fit the type of accounts listed previously. Joint accounts, revocable and irrevocable trust accounts, and employee benefit plans are covered, as are corporate, partnership, and unincorporated association accounts.
Important
If you have
more than $250,000 deposited
in an account type with a single bank, you may need to spread your assets among multiple banks to ensure you are fully covered by the FDIC.
FDIC insurance
doesn't cover
products such as mutual funds,
annuities
, life insurance policies, stocks, or
bonds
. The contents of safe-deposit boxes are also not included in FDIC coverage. Cashier's checks and money orders issued by the failed bank remain fully covered by the FDIC.
Eligible business accounts from a corporation, partnership, LLC, or unincorporated organization at a bank are also FDIC-covered.
Filing a Claim
A customer can file a claim with the FDIC as early as the day after a bank or
thrift
folds. The request can be submitted online through the
FDIC website
. By calling 877-275-3342 (1-877-ASKFDIC), bank customers can receive personalized assistance at no cost.
Note that the FDIC only insures against bank failures. Instances of fraud, theft, and similar loss are handled directly by the banking institution. The FDIC has
no jurisdiction over identity theft
.
Special Considerations
While banks are covered by the FDIC, deposits in credit unions are backstopped by the
National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund
(NCUSIF). The fund is regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and also insures individual accounts up to $250,000.
4
What Does FDIC Stand For?
The full name of the federal agency that insures bank deposits is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Why Was the FDIC Created?
The main purpose of the FDIC is to prevent ""run-on-the-bank"" scenarios, which devastated many banks during the Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
Are My Stock and Mutual Fund Holdings Protected by the FDIC?
No. FDIC insurance doesn't cover or offer loss reimbursement for mutual funds, stocks, annuities, life insurance policies, or bonds.
The Bottom Line
The FDIC insures deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of a bank failure or run. It was created during the Depression to bolster consumer confidence and encourage stability in the financial system. The agency insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, as long as the institution is a member firm. It's important to confirm whether a banking institution is FDIC-insured before opening an account or making a deposit there.

Break-even analysis determines the sales volume needed to cover fixed and variable costs, indicating the point at which a business neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss.
What Is Break-Even Analysis?
Break-even analysis compares income from sales to the fixed costs of doing business. The five components of break-even analysis are fixed costs, variable costs, revenue, contribution margin, and break-even point (BEP).
When companies calculate the BEP, they identify the amount of sales required to cover all fixed costs before profit generation can begin. The break-even point formula can determine the BEP in product units or sales dollars.
Key Takeaways:
Using the break-even point formula, businesses can determine how many units or dollars of sales cover the fixed and variable production costs.
The break-even point (BEP) is considered a measure of the margin of safety.
Break-even analysis is used for different reasons, from stock and options trading to corporate budgeting for various projects.
Once a company meets the break-even point, subsequent sales will exceed expenses and profits can be generated.
Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin
Understanding Break-Even Analysis
Break-even analysis looks at fixed costs relative to the profit earned by each additional unit produced and sold.
A firm with lower
fixed costs
will have a lower break-even point of sale and $0 of fixed costs will automatically have broken even with the sale of the first product, assuming
variable costs
do not exceed sales revenue.
Fixed costs remain the same regardless of how many units are sold. Examples of fixed and variable costs include:

Break-Even Point Formula
Break-even analysis involves a calculation of the
break-even point (BEP)
. The break-even point formula divides the total fixed production costs by the price per individual unit less the variable cost per unit.
1
BEP = Total Fixed Costs / (Price Per Unit - Variable Cost Per Unit)
Calculating Contribution Margin and BEPs
Contribution Margin
A product's
contribution margin
is the difference between the selling price of the product and its variable costs.
1
So, relative to the BEP formula above, you could also say that the BEP = Total Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin.
Contribution Margin = Item Price - Variable Cost Per Unit
For example, if an item sells for $100, with fixed costs of $25 per unit, and variable costs of $60 per unit, the contribution margin is:
$40 = ($100 - $60)
This $40 reflects the revenue collected to cover the remaining fixed costs, which are excluded when figuring the contribution margin.
Break-Even Point in Units
To find the total units required to break even, divide the total fixed costs by the unit contribution margin.
BEP (Units) = Total Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin
Assume total fixed costs are $20,000. With a contribution margin of $40 (shown above), the break-even point is:
500 units = $20,000 divided by $40.
Upon selling 500 units, the payment of all fixed costs is complete, and the company will report a net profit or loss of $0.
Break-Even Point in Dollars
To calculate the break-even point in sales dollars, you'll need to divide the total fixed costs by the contribution margin ratio. So, first, you must determine the ratio:
Contribution Margin Ratio = Contribution Margin Per Unit / Item Price
Continuing with the example above, the contribution margin ratio is:
40% = ($40 / $100) x 100 to convert to a percentage
Now, as noted just above, to calculate the BEP in dollars, divide total fixed costs by the contribution margin ratio.
BEP (Sales Dollars) = Total Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio
$50,000 = $20,000 / 40%
Important
In accounting, the
margin of safety
is the difference between actual sales and break-even sales.
2
Managers utilize the margin of safety to know how much sales can decrease before the company or project becomes unprofitable.
Who Calculates BEPs?
Entrepreneurs
Financial Analysts
Investors
Stock and Option Traders
Businesses
Government Agencies
Although investors may not be interested in an individual company's break-even analysis of production, they may use the calculation to determine at what price they will break even on a trade or investment.
1
The calculation is useful when trading in or creating a strategy to buy
options
or a fixed-income security product.
Why Break-Even Analysis Matters
Pricing
: With a clear understanding of their cost structure and a break-even numbers, companies can set prices for their products that cover their fixed and variable costs and provide a reasonable profit margin.
Decision-Making
: When it comes to new products and services, operational expansion, or increased production, businesses can chart their
profit to sales volume
and use break-even analysis to help them make informed decisions about those activities.
Cost Reduction
: Break-even analysis helps businesses to pinpoint areas where they can reduce costs to increase profitability.
Performance Metric:
Break-even analysis is a financial performance tool that helps businesses ascertain where they stand in achieving their goals.
What Are Some Limitations of Break-Even Analysis?
Break-even analysis assumes that the fixed and variable costs remain constant over time. However, costs may change due to factors such as inflation, changes in technology, and changes in market conditions. It also assumes that there is a linear relationship between costs and production. Break-even analysis ignores external factors such as competition, market demand, and changes in consumer preferences.
What Are the Components of Break-Even Analysis?
There are five components of break-even analysis: fixed costs, variable costs, revenue, contribution margin, and the break-even point (BEP).
Why Is the Contribution Margin Important in Break-Even Analysis?
The contribution margin represents the revenue required to cover a business' fixed costs and contribute to its profit. With the contribution margin calculation, a business can determine the break-even point and where it can begin earning a profit.
How Do Businesses Use the Break-Even Point in Break-Even Analysis?
The break-even point (BEP) helps businesses with pricing decisions, sales forecasting, cost management, and growth strategies. A business would not use break-even analysis
to measure its repayment
of debt or how long that repayment will take.
The Bottom Line
Break-even analysis, or the comparison of sales to fixed costs, is a tool used by businesses and stock and option traders. It is essential in determining the minimum sales volume required to cover total costs and break even. Beyond the break-even point, it's all profit. That is, sales will exceed expenses.
Break-even analysis helps businesses choose pricing strategies, and manage costs and operations. In stock and options trading, break-even analysis helps determine the minimum price movements required to cover trading costs and make a profit. Traders can use break-even analysis to set realistic profit targets, manage risk, and make informed trading decisions.

What Is Financial Technology (Fintech)?
Financial technology (better known as fintech) is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. ​​​At its core, fintech is utilized to help companies, business owners, and consumers better
manage their financial operations
, processes, and lives. It is composed of specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and smartphones. Fintech, the word, is a shortened combination of “financial technology.”
When fintech emerged in the 21st century, the term was initially applied to the technology employed at the backend systems of established financial institutions, such as banks. From 2018 or so to 2022, there was a shift to consumer-oriented services. Fintech now includes different sectors and industries such as education, retail banking, fundraising and nonprofit, and investment management, to name a few.
Fintech also includes the development and use of cryptocurrencies, such as
Bitcoin
. While that segment of fintech may see the most headlines, the big money still lies in the traditional global banking industry and its multitrillion-dollar
market capitalization
.
Key Takeaways
Fintech refers to the integration of technology into offerings by financial services companies to improve their use and delivery to consumers.
It primarily works by unbundling offerings by such firms and creating new markets for them.
Companies in the finance industry that use fintech have expanded financial inclusion and use technology to cut down on operational costs.
Fintech funding is on the rise, but regulatory problems exist.
Examples of fintech applications include robo-advisors, payment apps, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending apps, investment apps, and crypto apps, among others.
Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia
Understanding Fintech
Broadly, the term “financial technology” can apply to any innovation in how people transact business, from the invention of digital money to double-entry bookkeeping. Since the internet revolution, financial technology has grown explosively.
You likely use some element of fintech on a daily basis. Some examples include transferring money from your debit account to your checking account via your iPhone, sending money to a friend through Venmo, or managing investments through an online broker. According to EY’s 2019 Global FinTech Adoption Index, two-thirds of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services, and those consumers are increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives.

Fintech in Practice
The most talked-about (and most funded) fintech startups share the same characteristic: They are designed to challenge, and eventually take over, traditional financial services providers by being more nimble, serving an underserved segment of the population, or
providing faster or better service
.
For example, financial company
Affirm
seeks to cut
credit card companies
out of the online shopping process by offering a way for consumers to secure immediate, short-term loans for purchases. While rates can be high, Affirm claims to offer a way for consumers with poor or no credit a way to secure credit and build their
credit history
.
Similarly,
Better Mortgage
seeks to streamline the home mortgage process with a digital-only offering that can reward users with a verified pre-approval letter within 24 hours of applying. GreenSky seeks to link home improvement borrowers with banks by helping consumers avoid lenders and save on interest by offering zero-interest promotional periods.
For consumers with poor or no
credit
, Tala offers consumers in the developing world microloans by doing a deep data dig on their smartphones for their transaction history and seemingly unrelated things, such as what mobile games they play. Tala seeks to give such consumers better options than local banks, unregulated lenders, and other
microfinance
institutions.
2
In short, if you have ever wondered why some aspect of your financial life was so unpleasant (such as applying for a mortgage with a traditional lender) or felt like it wasn’t quite the right fit, fintech probably has (or seeks to have) a solution for you.
Fintech’s Expanding Horizons
In its most basic form, fintech unbundles financial services into individual offerings that are often easier to use. The combination of streamlined offerings with technology allows fintech companies to be more efficient and cut down on costs associated with each transaction.
If one word can describe how many
fintech innovations
have affected traditional trading, banking, financial advice, and products, it’s “disruption”—a word you have likely heard in commonplace conversations or the media. Financial products and services that were once the realm of branches, salespeople, and desktops are now more commonly found on mobile devices.
For example, the mobile-only stock trading app
Robinhood
charges no fees for trades,
3
and
peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
sites like Prosper Marketplace, LendingClub, and OnDeck promise to reduce rates by opening up competition for loans to broad market forces. Business loan providers such as Kabbage, Lendio, Accion, and Funding Circle (among others) offer startup and established businesses easy, fast platforms to secure working capital. Oscar, an online insurance startup, received $165 million in funding in March 2018.
4
Such significant funding rounds are not unusual and occur globally for fintech startups.
This shift to a digital-first mindset has pushed several traditional institutions to invest heavily in similar products. For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs launched consumer lending platform Marcus in 2016 in an effort to enter the fintech space.
5
That said, many tech-savvy industry watchers warn that keeping apace of fintech-inspired innovations requires more than just ramped-up tech spending. Rather, competing with lighter-on-their-feet startups requires a significant change in thinking, processes, decision making, and even overall corporate structure.
Fintech and New Technologies
New technologies, such as
machine learning
/artificial intelligence (AI), predictive behavioral analytics, and data-driven marketing, will take the guesswork and habit out of financial decisions. “Learning” apps will not only learn the habits of users but also engage users in learning games to make their automatic, unconscious spending and saving decisions better.
Fintech is also a keen adapter of automated customer service technology, utilizing chatbots and AI interfaces to assist customers with basic tasks and keep down staffing costs. Fintech is also being leveraged to fight fraud by leveraging information about payment history to flag transactions that are outside the norm.
Fintech Landscape
Since the mid-2010s, fintech has exploded, with startups receiving billions in
venture funding
(some of which have become
unicorns
) and incumbent financial firms either snatching up new ventures or building out their own fintech offerings.
North America still produces most of the fintech startups, with Asia a relatively close second, followed by Europe. Some of the most active areas of fintech innovation include or revolve around the following areas (among others):
Cryptocurrency
(Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), digital tokens (e.g.,
non-fungible tokens, or NFTs
), and digital cash. These often rely on
blockchain
technology, which is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that maintains records on a network of computers but has no central ledger. Blockchain also allows for so-called
smart contracts
, which utilize code to automatically execute contracts between parties such as buyers and sellers.
Open banking
, which is a concept that proposes that all people should have access to bank data to build applications that create a connected network of financial institutions and third-party providers. An example is the all-in-one money management tool
Mint
.
Insurtech
, which seeks to use technology to simplify and streamline the insurance industry.

, which seeks to help financial service firms meet industry compliance rules, especially those covering Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer protocols that fight fraud.

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a programming language embedded in Microsoft Office that can be used to automate processes and build functions.
What Is Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)?
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is used to write programs for Microsoft Office (MS Office, Office) applications, including Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Word, and Visio.
VBA allows users to customize beyond what's normally available with MS Office host applications.
1
Key Takeaways
Visual Basic for Applications is a computer programming language developed and owned by Microsoft.
You can create macros to automate repetitive word- and data-processing functions with VBA and generate custom forms, graphs, and reports.
VBA is not a standalone product; it functions within MS Office applications.
VBA is accessed in Excel by hitting Alt + F11 when using an Excel workbook.
VBA leverages objects, variables, properties, projects, logical operators, and modules to make statements recognizable by debugging processes.
Understanding Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
VBA is an event-driven tool. You can use it to tell the computer to initiate an action or string of actions by typing commands into an editing module to build custom macroinstructions (macros).
A macro is essentially a sequence of inputs that result in a sequence of outputs. This accomplishes specific computing tasks. You don't have to purchase the VBA software because VBA ships with Microsoft Office.
VBA allows users to manipulate graphical user interface (GUI) features such as toolbars, menus, dialogue boxes, and forms. You can use VBA to create user-defined functions (UDFs), access Windows
application programming interfaces (APIs)
, and automate specific computer processes and calculations.
2
Fast Fact
Microsoft hosts various
learning opportunities
for entry-level developers to gain modest experience working with VBA.
3
VBA in Excel
All Office suite programs share common programming languages, and each is capable of integrating VBA code to enhance it. VBA has been a natural fit with Excel, more so than with other Office suite programs, because of the repetitive nature of spreadsheets,
data analytics
, and organizing data.
The root of the relationship between VBA and Excel is often tied to using macros. You can use VBA to run a macro in Excel, but you can also use it for non-macro activities.
How to Access VBA in Excel
Simply press Alt + F11 to access VBA in Excel.

A new window appears when you double-click on a project on the top left. There's no information in this area, but you'll see two dropdowns that say ""(General)"" and ""(Declarations)."" VBA code is directly entered into this coding window.
VBA Example, Code.
Here's an example of a VBA code that's been entered:
VBA Example, Code with Coding.
Many important buttons and tools appear on the toolbar. The items highlighted in yellow are the run, break, and reset toggles for the VBA code. The run button executes the code. The break button pauses the code activity. The reset stops the execution of the code and brings the process back to the starting position of the code.
VBA Example, Toolbar.
What You Can Do With VBA
Financial modeling is about manipulating huge amounts of data, and VBA is endemic to the
financial services sector
. It's likely running within applications you use each day if you work in finance, if you're not aware of it. Some jobs in the industry require prior knowledge of VBA, others don't. You can:
Write macros
:
Macros allow financial professionals such as accountants, commercial bankers,
investment bankers
, research analysts, salespeople, traders, portfolio managers, clerks, and administrators to analyze and adjust huge amounts of data quickly.
Update data
: You can use VBA in Excel to create and maintain complex trading, pricing, and risk-management models, to forecast sales and earnings, and to generate financial ratios.
Perform scenario analysis
: You can create various portfolio management and
investment scenarios
with Visual Basic for Applications. This includes filtering through situations that may impact outcomes differently.
Organize information
: You can also use VBA to produce customers' names or other content, create invoices, forms, charts, analyze scientific data, and manage data display for budgets and forecasting.
Be unconventional
: VBA can be used to copy and paste values, adjust cell styles for an entire workbook, and strike accelerator keys. You can perform very normal tasks in an easier, automated manner.
Prompt action
: VBA can be used to interact with users. You use a user's input to place their first and last names on a form. VBA prompts a user in a way that makes this input unavoidably mandatory.
Tip
Many online forums provide VBA code that allows you to simply copy and paste the code for your personal use. Be cautious when using someone else's code, especially if you're unfamiliar with the source, the individual, or the logic of the code.
Important VBA Terms
Module
A module is where Excel stores the VBA code. Information regarding the modules within a spreadsheet can be found in Project Explorer, one of the sections of the Visual Basic Editor. All modules can be saved within a modules folder. Modules are sometimes referred to as standard modules.
Objects
Most code is used to manipulate objects in VBA. Objects are items such as workbooks, worksheets, cells, cell ranges, or cell fonts. Objects are often selected or referred to as part of the code when you're coding in VBA. The code can use the ""ActiveCell"" language to manipulate the object currently selected in the spreadsheet. You can also create a process that executes when a
bar chart
is edited.
Procedures
The procedure is the part of a computer program that performs a specific task. It's the block of code that starts with a declaration and finishes with an end declaration. There are two types of procedures in VBA. Sub procedures form an action in Excel and begin with the text ""Sub."" Function procedures carry out calculations and return a value.
Statement
A statement is an instruction that can be broken into two types. First, a declaration statement is used to state something, such as defining a constant or a variable value. Second, executable statements designate code that specifies what a certain action is.
Variables
Variables are storage locations for defined items. They hold specific values that may change as VBA scripts are performed. The variable ""FirstName"" may not contain any value, but it can be assigned the FirstName variable and given the value ""Jo"" after the user inputs their name. Variables in coding can be different depending on the situation, similar to how
variable costs
can change over time.
Logical Operators
Logical operators are the functions that allow for greater analytical and processing capabilities. They're bits of code that allow a computer to understand and compare items. VBA can analyze whether the user's name is ""Jo."" The program can analyze the input and perform a logical evaluation using logical operators such as ""if, then"", ""true"", and ""false.""
Important
Visual Basic for Applications is the only version of VB 6 that's still supported by Microsoft. It's only available as an internal component of Office programs.
5
VBA Users
Basic Users
Visual Basic for Applications allows users to perform myriad functions within MS Office applications that go beyond simple word processing and
spreadsheet operations
. VBA helps to make frequent everyday tasks less repetitive via macros for the most basic user.
Macros can automate just about any task, such as generating customized charts and reports and performing word- and data-processing functions. You can write a macro with a single click that will allow Excel to create an entire balance sheet from a series of
accounting
entries in a spreadsheet.
Advanced Users
Programmers use macros in more complex ways, like replicating large pieces of code, merging existing program functions, and designing specific languages. Advanced VBA code can convert a single row vector into a matrix, populate a range, or manipulate the characteristics of a sheet.
Companies and Organizations
VBA can also work in external, non-Microsoft settings by using a technology called COM interface that allows commands to interact across computer boundaries.
6
Many firms have implemented VBA within their applications, both proprietary and commercial, including AutoCAD, ArcGIS, CATIA, Corel, raw, and SolidWorks.
Any firm may use VBA to customize Excel for a unique purpose, such as discerning how long it would take to earn $1 million in an investment portfolio based on a specific
interest rate
and other factors like the number of years until retirement.
What Is VBA Used for?
VBA is used to further expand what some programs can accomplish. It's often used to create macros, automate processes, generate custom forms, or perform repetitive tasks that may need minimal human intervention.
Is VBA the Same As Excel?
VBA is a computer language that's used within Excel. It enhances its capabilities. Excel is a broader software that's used for many types of analytical functions.
Is VBA Difficult to Learn?
VBA is relatively easier to learn compared to other complex languages. It's considered a beginner-friendly language. VBA coders often don't have to have prior experience to learn the language. The VBA community also has many resources availa",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/visual-basic-for-applications-vba.asp

The stock market consists of a primary market where businesses first issue shares to investors and a secondary market where investors trade shares.
What Is the Stock Market?
The stock market is a broad term for the network of exchanges, brokerages, and over-the-counter venues where investors buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies. Though people sometimes use ""stock market"" to refer to the
New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) or the
Nasdaq
, these exchanges are components of a wider global marketplace.
In the United States, the
Securities and Exchange Commission
regulates companies that want to sell shares to the public. Businesses must register with the SEC and publish periodic disclosures and financial statements.
Key Takeaways
Companies issue shares on the stock market to raise capital and expand their business.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was created to govern securities transactions on the secondary market.
Investors may buy shares to receive dividends, vote in corporate elections, or sell shares at a higher price.
Ellen Lindner / Investopedia
How the Stock Market Works
When people refer to the stock market, they often refer to a specific exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange. But the stock market is a larger system of exchanges, brokerages, and
over-the-counter
markets: Anywhere you can buy part of a company is part of the stock market.
In this vast, complex network of trading activities, shares of companies are bought and sold, protected by laws against fraud and other unfair trading practices. The stock market plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling money to move between investors and companies.
People purchase stocks for a lot of reasons. Some hold onto shares, looking for income from dividends. Others look for low-priced stocks that are likely to gain value, so that they can sell at a profit. Still, others might be interested in having a say in how particular companies are run. That’s because you can vote at shareholder meetings based on the number of shares you own.

Owning shares gives you the right to part of the company's profits, often paid as dividends, and sometimes the right to vote on company matters.
Sometimes the best way to see how something works is to look at its parts. In that light, let's review the major elements of the stock market, from the companies selling shares to stocks to exchanges to the indexes that give us a snapshot of the stock market's health:
What Are Public Companies?
Not all companies can offer stock to the public. In the U.S., only companies that are registered with the SEC can sell their shares on a public exchange like the NYSE or Nasdaq. These companies must meet stringent regulations and financial disclosure laws.
The traditional route to going public is via an
initial public offering
(IPO). In the 2020s,
special purpose acquisition companies
(SPACs) have emerged as an alternative route for
going public
.
The
primary market
consists of those who buy their shares directly from the company, such as early investors, company insiders, and, for companies going public, financial
underwriters
. It also includes
private placements
, where a company sells its shares directly to investors without going through the registration process.
Once a company goes public, its stock can be traded in the secondary market via exchanges or ""over the counter."" More than 58,000 companies worldwide are publicly traded today.

Stocks: Buying and Selling Shares
When you buy a stock or a share, you're getting a piece of that company. How much of the company you own depends on the number of shares the company has issued and the number of shares you own.
If it's a small, private company, a single share could represent a large part of the company. Major public companies often have millions, even billions, of shares. For example, Apple Inc. (
AAPL
) has billions of shares in circulation, so a single share is just a tiny fraction of the company.
The price of a stock changes based on the demand for shares from new investors who want to buy, or the supply of shares from existing investors who want to sell. Not every investor makes decisions based on the same criteria, and what might seem like a high price to one investor is a bargain to another. This dynamic keeps shares trading hands and makes future prices difficult to predict.
What Is a Stock Exchange?
Once a company goes public, its shares can be traded freely on the stock market. This means that investors can buy and sell shares among themselves. Most trading occurs on stock exchanges, although there are other venues for trading.
Stock exchanges are organized and regulated ""places"" (today it's mostly virtual) where stocks and other securities are bought and sold. They play a crucial role in the financial system by providing a platform for companies to raise money by selling their stocks and bonds to the public.
The NYSE and Nasdaq are prime examples, serving as central locations for buying and selling stocks. There are many other major exchanges worldwide, such as the London Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Each exchange has its own internal rules, and investors follow different national and local laws. These are meant to ensure fair trading practices and to keep investors confident in dealing there. They also provide transparency in the trading process, giving real-time information on securities prices.
A major benefit of trading on stock exchanges is
liquidity
, the ability to buy or sell stocks relatively easily. With thousands of buyers and sellers, there is always someone willing to buy or sell shares for the right price.
Many stock exchanges cross-list company shares, offering securities listed on other exchanges. This allows companies to reach more investors when raising capital, and gives investors a wider range of trading options.
Fast Fact
Though it is called a stock market, other securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are also traded there.
Over-the-Counter Market
Stocks can also be traded ""over the counter"" (OTC). These OTC markets are where you buy or sell stocks directly with another investor, typically without the same level of regulation or public scrutiny. OTC trading involves a network of brokers and dealers who negotiate directly over computer networks and by phone.
This type of trading is commonly used for smaller, less liquid companies that may not meet the stringent listing requirements of the stock exchanges. This can make it more challenging for investors to get reliable information about the companies they are investing in.
Other Assets Sold on the Stock Market
In addition to common stocks, many other assets are traded on stock exchanges and OTC. These are also considered part of the ""stock market"":
American depositary receipts
: These represent shares in foreign companies and are traded on U.S. stock exchanges. They let U.S. investors invest in foreign companies without dealing with foreign stock exchanges or converting their currency.
Derivatives
: This is a broad category that includes options and futures, whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indexes. So, in derivatives trading, you're not directly buying or selling the actual asset (like the stock). Instead, you're trading something whose value is influenced by the changes in the price of an underlying asset.
Funds
: These include mutual funds, which pool money from many investors for a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities, and exchange-traded funds, which trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks and ""track"" or try to mirror how a sector, index, or theme of stocks is doing.
Preferred stocks
: These stocks generally provide a set dividend and, as the name suggests, have priority over common stock in getting a share of the profits or what's left over if the company goes bankrupt.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
: These are worth mentioning to get an idea of the breadth of what counts as the stock market. REITs are companies that own, manage, or finance real estate. Investors can buy shares in them, and they legally must provide 90% of their profits as dividends each year.

Investopedia,"Antwerp Rules: Meaning, Origin, When it's Used","Close
What Are York Antwerp Rules?
The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime regulations concerning protocols surrounding jettisoned
cargo
. Often, contracts and bills of lading will include these maritime rules and use them as a framework to establish liability and assign costs for lost and damaged cargo. The rules are broken into provisions that help set cost obligations. Provisions include the general average to help allocate the cost of losses, the particular average relating to the cargo owner, and the salvage average applied to salvage operations and rescue crews.
Key Takeaways
The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime regulations surrounding jettisoned cargo.
The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime rules dating back to 1890.
The rules are a codification of the law of general average.
How York Antwerp Rules Work
The York Antwerp Rules are a set of maritime rules that were established in 1890. Amended several times since their inception, this set of maritime rules outlines the rights and obligations of both ship and cargo owners in the case that cargo must be jettisoned in order to save a ship. Generally, bills of lading, contracts of affreightment and marine
insurance policies
all include the York Antwerp Rules in their language.
The York Antwerp Rules state three clear principles, all of which must be met in order for the rule to be applied. The first stipulation is that danger to the ship must be imminent. Second, there must be a voluntary jettison of a portion of the
ship’s cargo
in order to save the whole. Third, the attempt to avoid the danger must be successful. If a situation meets all the stipulations, all parties involved in the maritime adventure must share proportionately in the financial burden of the losses incurred to the owner or owners of any of the cargo that was jettisoned in order to save the vessel.
Important
All three principles of the York Antwerp Rules must be met for the rules to apply.
Origins of the York Antwerp Rules
The York Antwerp Rules are a codification of a principle called the law of general average. Though the York Antwerp Rules are quite old themselves, the law of general average is a much older
maritime
principle with roots that go back to Ancient Greece. The law specifies that all parties involved in a sea venture must proportionately share in any losses that result from sacrifices made to the cargo to save the remainder.
When Do You Use the York Antwerp Rules?
In a life-threatening situation at sea, the captain and crew may deem it necessary to jettison the cargo. To jettison cargo is a maritime term that is the last resort in an emergency situation where the crew throws the cargo overboard in order to stabilize the vessel. If there is a threat to a ship, due to damage to the hull, weather conditions, etc., the staff will jettison the cargo.
While jettisoning happens as a last resort, the crew must move quickly when they throw the cargo overboard, which means they do not have time to see whose cargo gets tossed. This is when the York Antwerp Rules come into play, as those who lost their cargo will receive compensation from the profits of the ship’s owner and the owners of the other cargo.

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely stores records across a network of computers in a way that is transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. Each ""block"" contains data, and blocks are linked in a chronological ""chain.""
What Is a Blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—meaning it cannot  be altered.
Since a block can’t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This reduces the need for trusted third parties, such as auditors or other humans, who add costs and can make mistakes.
Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of
various cryptocurrencies
,
decentralized finance (DeFi)
applications,
non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
, and
smart contracts
.
Key Takeaways
Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.
Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use has been as a transaction ledger.
In Bitcoin’s case, the blockchain is decentralized, so no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control.
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu
How Does a Blockchain Work?
You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. The key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.
A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: entering and accessing information, and
saving and storing it somewhere
. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.

The Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a
block
(different blockchains have different size blocks). Once the block is full, the block data is run through a cryptographic hash function, which creates a hexadecimal number called the
block header
hash.
The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name “blockchain.”
Transaction Process
Transactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your
cryptocurrency wallet
—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.
In Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.
Every node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the ""nonce,"" short for number used once.
The nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases with every mining attempt. If the resulting hash isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving
the reward
.
Fast Fact
Generating these hashes until a specific value is found is the ""proof-of-work"" you hear so much about—it ""proves"" the miner did the work. The sheer
amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.
Once a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered confirmed until five other blocks have been validated.
Confirmation takes the network about one hour
to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).
Not all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the
Ethereum
network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin's process.
Blockchain Decentralization
A blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This creates redundancy and maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record on one node, the other nodes would prevent it from happening by comparing block hashes. This way, no single node can alter information within the chain.
Because of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the blockchain data, such as transaction history, becomes irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions, but private blockchains can also hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's inventory. Most blockchains wouldn't ""store"" these items directly; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token.
Blockchain Transparency
Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by downloading and inspecting them or by using
blockchain explorers
that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.
For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are stored on the blockchain.
Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.
Is Blockchain Secure?
Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the ""end"" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be altered.
A change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block's hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, a change can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks.
Fast Fact
Not all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.
A new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the computational power of the network (
a 51% attack
). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally rapid—the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of around 640 exahashes per sec",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

Definition
Economic growth occurs in response to a rise in the production of capital goods, technology, or human capital and it generally corresponds with a rise in national income.
What Is Economic Growth?
Economic growth is an increase in the production of economic goods and services in one period compared to a previous period. It can be measured in nominal or real terms. Aggregate economic growth is traditionally measured in terms of
gross national product (GNP)
or
gross domestic product (GDP)
but alternative metrics are sometimes used.
Key Takeaways
Economic growth is an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy.
Increases in capital goods, labor force, technology, and human capital can all contribute to economic growth.
Tax cuts are generally less effective in spurring economic growth than increases in government spending.
Economic growth is commonly measured in terms of the increase in aggregate market value of additional goods and services produced using estimates such as GDP.

How Economic Growth Works
Economic growth refers to an increase in aggregate production in an
economy
which generally manifests as a rise in national income.
Aggregate gains in production often but do not necessarily correlate with increased average
marginal productivity
. This leads to an increase in incomes, inspiring consumers to open up their wallets and buy more and driving a higher material quality of life and standard of living.
Growth in economics is commonly modeled as a function of
physical capital
, human capital, labor force, and technology. Increasing the quantity or quality of the working-age population, the tools they have to work with, and the recipes they have available to combine labor, capital, and raw materials will lead to increased economic output.

Phases of Economic Growth
The economy moves through different periods of activity. This movement is referred to as the
business cycle
. It consists of four phases:

Expansion
: Employment, income, industrial production, and sales all increase during this phase, and there's a rising real GDP.
Peak
: This is when an economic expansion hits its ceiling. It's effectively a turning point.
Contraction
: The elements of an expansion all begin to decrease during this phase. It becomes a recession when a significant decline in economic activity spreads across the economy.
Trough
: This is when an economic contraction hits its nadir.
A single business cycle is dated from peak to peak or trough to trough. Cycles generally aren't regular in length and there can be a period of contraction during an expansion or vice versa.
The U.S. economy has experienced more expansions than contractions since World War II. The average expansion lasted about 65 months from 1945 to 2019. The average contraction was only 11 months. The Great Recession lasted for 18 months, however, from December 2007 to June 2009. This was followed by the longest expansion on record of 128 months, lasting until 2020 and the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Note
Governments often try to stimulate economic growth by lowering interest rates, making money cheaper to borrow. That can only last for so long, however. Rates must eventually be hiked to combat price inflation and keep the economy from boiling over as happened in 2022 and 2023.
2
How to Measure Economic Growth
The most common measure of economic growth is
real GDP
. This is the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy with that value adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. There are three different methods for looking at real GDP:
Quarterly growth at an annual rate
: This looks at the change in the GDP from quarter to quarter which is then compounded into an annual rate. The annual rate would be extrapolated to 1.2% if one quarter’s change is 0.3%.
Four-quarter or year-over-year growth rate
: This compares a single quarter’s GDP from two successive years as a percentage. It's often used by businesses to offset the effects of seasonal variations.
Annual average growth rate
: This is the average of changes in each of the four quarters. The annual average growth rate for the year would be 7.5% ÷ 4 = 1.875% if there were four-quarter rates of 2%, 3%, 1.5%, and 1% in one year.
Note
GDP is the most popular way to measure economic growth. It's calculated by adding up all the money spent by consumers, businesses, and the government in a given period. The formula is: GDP = consumer spending + business investment + government spending +
net exports
.
Of course, measuring the value of a commodity is tricky. Some goods and services are considered to be worth more than others. A smartphone is more valuable than a pair of socks. Growth has to be measured in the value of goods and services, not just the quantity.
Another problem is that not all individuals place the same value on the same goods and services. A heater is more valuable to a resident of Alaska. An air conditioner is more valuable to a resident of Florida. Some people value steak more than fish.
A common approximation is the current market value. This is measured in terms of U.S. dollars in the United States and is added together to produce aggregate measures of output including GDP.
Important
There are
alternatives to GDP
. The World Bank uses gross national income per capita which includes income sent back by citizens working overseas to measure economic growth, classify countries for analytical purposes, and determine borrowing eligibility.

How to Generate Economic Growth
Economic growth is dependent on four contributory areas:
Increase in Physical Capital Goods
The first factor is an increase in the amount of physical
capital goods
in the economy. Adding capital to the economy tends to increase the productivity of labor. Newer, better, and more tools mean that workers can produce more output per period. A fisherman with a net will catch more fish per hour than a fisherman with a rod.
Two things are critical to this process, however. Someone in the economy must first engage in some form of saving to free up the resources to create the new capital. The new capital must additionally be of the right type, in the right place, and activated at the right time for workers to use it productively.
Improvements in Technology
A second method of producing economic growth is through technological improvements. The economic value of
petroleum
was relatively low before the discovery of the energy-generating power of gasoline fuel. This changed when the use of gasoline proved to be a more productive method of transporting goods.
Improved technology allows workers to produce more output with the same stock of capital goods by combining them in novel ways that are more productive. Like capital growth, the rate of technical growth is highly dependent on the rate of savings and investment because they're necessary to engage in
research and development
.
Fast Fact
The
four factors of production
are land and natural resources, labor, capital equipment, and entrepreneurship.
Growth of the Labor Force
Another way to
generate economic growth
is to grow the labor force. More workers generate more economic goods and services.
A portion of the robust U.S. economic growth was due to a high influx of cheap, productive immigrant labor during the 19th century. There are some key conditions to this process, however, as with capital-driven growth.
4
Increasing the labor force necessarily increases the amount of output that must be consumed to provide for the basic subsistence of the new workers. The new workers have to be at least productive enough to offset this and not be net consumers.
It's also important for the right type of workers to flow to the right jobs in the right places in combination with the right types of complementary capital goods to realize their productive potential.
Increase Human Capital
The last method is to increase
human capital
. Laborers become more accomplished at their crafts, raising their productivity through skills training, trial and error, or simply more practice. Savings, investment, and specialization are the most consistent and easily controlled methods.
Human capital can also refer to social and institutional capit",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp
Investopedia,Inflation: What It Is and How to Control Inflation Rates,"Close
What Is Inflation?
Inflation is a gradual loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time. The inflation rate is calculated as the average price increase of a
basket of selected goods
and services over one year. High inflation means that prices are increasing quickly, while low inflation means that prices are growing more slowly. Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when prices decline and
purchasing power
increases.
Key Takeaways
Inflation measures how quickly the prices of goods and services are rising.
Inflation is classified into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.
The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index.
Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint and rate of change.
Those with tangible assets may like to see some inflation as it raises the value of their assets.
What Is Inflation?
Understanding Inflation
An increase in the
money supply
is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy. A country’s money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities by:
Printing and giving away more money to citizens
Legally devaluing (reducing the value of) the
legal tender
currency
Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market
Other causes of inflation include supply bottlenecks and shortages of key goods, which can push prices to rise.

When inflation occurs, money loses its purchasing power. This can occur across any
sector
or throughout an entire economy. The expectation of inflation itself can further sustain the
devaluation
of money. Workers may demand higher wages and businesses may charge higher prices, in anticipation of sustained inflation. This, in turn, reinforces the factors that push prices up.
Melissa Ling © Investopedia, 2019
Types of Inflation
Inflation can be classified into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.
Demand-Pull Effect
Demand-pull inflation
occurs when an increase in the supply of money and credit stimulates the overall demand for goods and services to increase more rapidly than the economy’s production capacity. This increases demand and leads to price rises.
When people have more money, it leads to positive consumer sentiment. This, in turn, leads to higher spending, which pulls prices higher. It creates a demand-supply gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices.
Cost-Push Effect
Cost-push inflation
is a result of the increase in prices working through the production process inputs. When additions to the supply of money and credit are channeled into a commodity or other asset markets, costs for all kinds of intermediate goods rise. This is especially evident when there’s a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities.
These developments lead to higher costs for the finished product or service and work their way into rising consumer prices. For instance, when the money supply is expanded, it creates a speculative boom in
oil prices
. This means that the cost of energy can rise and contribute to rising consumer prices, which is reflected in various measures of inflation.
Built-In Inflation
Built-in inflation is related to adaptive expectations or the idea that people expect current inflation rates to continue in the future. As the price of goods and services rises, people may expect a continuous rise in the future at a similar rate.
As such, workers may demand more costs or wages to maintain their standard of living. Their increased wages result in a higher cost of goods and services, and
this wage-price spiral
continues as one factor induces the other and vice versa.
How Inflation Impacts Prices
While it is easy to measure the price changes of individual products over time, human needs extend beyond just one or two products. Individuals need a big and diversified set of products as well as a host of services to live a comfortable life. They include
commodities
like food grains, metal, fuel, utilities like electricity and transportation, and services like
healthcare
, entertainment, and labor.
Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes for a diversified set of products and services. It allows for a single value representation of the increase in the price level of goods and services in an
economy
over a specified time.
Prices rise, which means that one unit of money buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nation’s
money supply
growth outpaces economic growth.
3%
The increase in the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
over the 12 months ending January 2025 on an unadjusted basis. Prices increased by 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis in January 2025 from the previous month.
1
To combat this, the monetary authority (in most cases, the
central bank
) takes the necessary steps to manage the money supply and credit to keep inflation within permissible limits and keep the economy running smoothly.
Theoretically,
monetarism
is a popular theory that explains the relationship between inflation and the money supply of an economy. For example, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, massive amounts of
gold and silver
flowed into the Spanish and other European economies. Since the money supply rapidly increased, the value of money fell, contributing to rapidly rising prices.
2
Inflation is measured in a variety of ways depending on the types of goods and services. It is the opposite of
deflation
, which indicates a general decline in prices when the inflation rate falls below 0%. Keep in mind that deflation shouldn’t be confused with
disinflation
, which is a related term referring to a slowing down in the (positive) rate of inflation.

How to Protect Your Finances During Inflation
There are a range of measures that individuals can take to
protect their finances
against inflation. For instance, one may choose to invest in asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary times. This might include commodities like grain, beef, oil, electricity, and natural gas.
Commodity prices typically stay one step ahead of product prices, and price increases for commodities are often seen as an indicator of inflation to come. Commodities, which can also be volatile, are easily affected by natural disasters, geopolitics, or conflict.
Real estate income may also help buffer against inflation, as landlords can increase their rent to keep pace with the rise of prices overall.
The U.S. government also offers
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
, a type of security indexed to inflation to protect against declines in purchasing power.
Types of Price Indexes
Depending upon the selected set of goods and services used, multiple types of baskets of goods are calculated and tracked as price indexes. The most commonly used price indexes are the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
and the
Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
The CPI is a measure that examines the
weighted average
of prices of a basket of goods and services that are of primary consumer needs. They include transportation, food, and medical care.
CPI is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them based on their relative weight in the whole basket. The prices in consideration are the retail prices of each item, as available for purchase by the individual citizens.
CPI can impact the value of one currency
against those of other nations.
Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the
cost of living
, making it one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation. In the United States, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
reports the CPI each month and has calculated it as far back as 1913.
3
Important
The CPI-U, which was introduced in 1978, represents the buying habits of approximately 88% of the noninstitutional population of the United States.
4
5
Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
The WPI is another popular measure of inflation. It measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level.
While WPI items vary from one country to another, they mostly include items at the producer or wholesale level. For example, it includes cotton prices for raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton gray goods, and cotton clothing.
6
Although many countries and organizations use the WPI, many other countries, including the U.S., use a similar variant called the
Producer Price Index (PPI)
.
7
Producer Price Index (PPI)
The PPI is a family of indexes that measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers of intermediate goods and services over time. The PPI measures price changes from the perspective of the seller and differs from the CPI, which measures price changes from the perspective of the buyer.
8
In all variants, the rise in the price of one component (say oil) may cancel out the price decline in another (say wheat) to a certain extent. Overall, each index represents the average weighted price change for the given constituents which may apply at the overall
economy
, sector, or commodity level.

What Is a Homeowners Association (HOA)?
A homeowners association (HOA) is an organization in a subdivision, planned community, or
condominium
building that makes and enforces rules for the properties and residents. Homeowners associations are run by a board of directors and typically collect monthly or annual fees to pay for common area maintenance and the upkeep of facilities.
Those who purchase property within an HOA’s jurisdiction automatically become members. Some associations can be very restrictive about what members can do with their properties. Others give residents more freedom.
Key Takeaways
A homeowners association (HOA) is an organization that makes and enforces rules and guidelines for a subdivision, planned community, or condominium building.
HOA members are the residents of the subdivision, community, or building.
Some communities require mandatory membership for individuals who purchase property in the zone.
Homeowners associations are run by a board of directors and typically collect monthly or annual fees to pay for common area maintenance and the upkeep of facilities.
Homeowners associations may impose fines on noncompliant homeowners.
Sydney Saporito / Investopedia
How Homeowners Associations (HOAs) Work
Homeowners associations (HOAs) are usually formed within communities or neighborhoods of single-family homes or multiple-unit buildings such as townhomes or condominiums. An HOA is typically established to make and enforce rules regarding the
properties
within the jurisdiction.
HOAs are composed of and run by the community’s residents. Membership is usually a requirement to buy a home within a community where an HOA has been established.
An HOA usually has a board of directors or governors. These groups are elected to enforce and oversee the HOA’s rules and regulations. An HOA typically describes its rules as
restrictive covenants
in a document called a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs).
CC&Rs set certain conditions for owners about the maintenance of their properties.
1
These sometimes include structural restrictions such as the type of fences or landscape allowed. They may also include more minor aesthetic choices like the color of paint on a house.
A CC&R document may also outline the penalties for violating the guidelines in the agreement. These penalties can take the shape of
fees
or forced compliance. They can even be as drastic as litigation in some cases.
Homeowners Association (HOA) Fees
Some HOAs can wield significant financial and legal power over the property owners in their zone. HOAs collect monthly or annual
HOA fees
that depend on several factors:
Type of property
Number of properties in the group
Location
Amenities offered
Operating expenses
The fees are typically $200 to $400 per month but they can range anywhere from less than $100 to upward of $10,000 in luxury neighborhoods or communities.
HOA fees also often contribute to the association’s reserve fund which is set aside for major renovation projects or emergency use. In addition to regular fees, HOAs can also impose special assessments on homeowners when the association lacks sufficient reserves to pay for unexpected repairs on common areas such as sidewalks or parking lots.
The HOA’s board is usually responsible for the organization’s finances and it oversees the collection and management of funds. Along with setting dues and assessments, the board can slap fines on homeowners who break the rules or damage the common areas. HOAs can also place a
lien
on a property if a homeowner falls seriously behind on their dues.
Important
Existing HOA liens can make it difficult to sell the home unless they're cleared.
Homeowners Associations (HOAs) vs. Community Associations vs. Property Owner Associations
Most HOAs are
incorporated
so they're subject to state laws. Some states consider condominium-based HOAs (often called condominium communities) and organizations governing cooperatives (called co-op boards) to be distinct entities from HOAs, however.
This distinction is made on the assumption that the property interests of these organizations differ. The designation community association serves as a broader, umbrella term as a result. It encompasses HOAs, condominium communities, and co-op boards.
1
An HOA is distinct from a property owners’ association, which usually refers to a group of people who want to better their community and the real estate values of the property there. The main difference between them and HOAs is that property owners’ associations can include anyone in the community with an interest in the value of the community’s real estate, including individuals who aren’t homeowners.
365,000
The number of HOAs in the United States as of 2023, according to the Foundation for Community Association Research.
2
That number is expected to increase by 3,000 in 2024. About 75.5 million Americans reside in a community association neighborhood or property.
3
Advantages and Disadvantages of Homeowners Associations (HOAs)
Advantages
The HOA provides regulations and guidelines for its members. These standards are upheld to preserve and enhance the community’s
property values
.
The guidelines are often appearance-oriented so they deal with regulations for the cleanliness of the property, the condition of the property, and any repairs that are done to the property. The guidelines for HOAs are usually designed to help ensure a uniform appearance for all the properties included in the association’s zone.
The HOA management will typically provide additional services for its members in exchange for their HOA fees. These amenities are available to all HOA members and may include:
Landscaping
Parking lots
Swimming pools
Tennis courts
Party spaces
Snow removal
Some HOA fees may also cover the cost of trash collection and certain
utilities
.
HOAs are symbolic of self-governance and democracy for certain individuals. This belief may stem from the idea that the best people to manage a community are those who live in it rather than a landlord who doesn’t reside on the premises.
Disadvantages
One disadvantage of an HOA is the high cost of the association fees. This can act as a deterrent for some prospective buyers. The HOA rules and regulations can also seem unreasonable, arbitrary, or too restrictive for some homeowners who may want the freedom to customize their properties.
HOA board members are normally volunteers and they may not be properly trained to manage
real estate
, deal with complex financial issues, or unite a disparate group of people for a common cause. The leadership of HOAs must reach a consensus when they're making decisions about maintenance and upgrades so it's also possible that there may be conflicts among HOA members who disagree.
Pros
Set and enforce community rules
Protect property values
Provide services, amenities, and facilities
Offer self-governance
Cons
Impose fees, dues, and assessments
Maintain restrictive regulations
Operate inefficiently
May be run amateurishly or ineptly
Example of a Homeowners Association (HOA)
Individual homeowners may conflict with their HOAs. One thorny issue in particular relates to the installation of solar panels. HOA boards often don’t like them, fearing that they hurt property values. They’re allowed to forbid homeowners from adding them to their residences in 23 states.
4
An electrical engineer residing in Blaine, Minnesota applied for permission to add
solar panels
to their house in 2020. The HOA rejected their proposal in October of that year, citing aesthetic concerns because the panels were too visible from the street. The HOA also cited the lack of established guidelines for rooftop solar in the association’s bylaws.
4
The electrical engineer joined a group of homeowners and solar advocates asking Minnesota lawmakers to support a bill that would allow homeowners associations to regulate but not ban the installation of solar thermal panels on single-family homes. Introduced in the Minnesota House of Representatives in early 2021, it was one of a series of similar bills proposed that never passed.

What Does a Homeowners Association (HOA) Cover?
A homeowners association (HOA) is an organization tasked with governing the affairs of a real estate development owned by multiple parties such as an apartment building. HOAs are responsible for tasks such as ensuring building maintenance, deciding on whether to pursue larger renovation projects, and drafting and enforcing the building’s bylaws.

Investopedia,Utilities and the Utilities Sector: Pros and Cons for Investors,"Close
What Is the Utilities Sector?
Sector investing offers targeted opportunities into the stocks of companies in specific segments of the economy. The utilities sector includes companies such as electric, gas, or water utilities or those that operate as producers or distributors of power.
As of January 2025, the sector had a
market capitalization
of over $1.83 trillion.
1
Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service infrastructure and are heavily regulated. Those who include utilities in their portfolios hold them as long-term investments and commonly use them to generate income through
dividends
.
Key Takeaways
The utilities sector includes the stock of companies such as electric, gas, and water utilities.
Investors commonly buy utilities as long-term holdings.
The sector is often used as an investment during economic downturns.
Challenges for the sector include regulatory oversight and costly infrastructure updating and maintenance.
Clean energy initiatives have some analysts forecasting strong growth for the utility industry in the 2020s.
Understanding the Utilities Sector
Utilities include large companies that offer multiple services such as electricity and natural gas or specialize in just one type of service, such as water. Some utilities rely on clean and
renewable energy
sources like wind turbines and solar panels to produce electricity.
Utilities typically offer investors stable and consistent dividends, coupled with less price
volatility
relative to the overall equity markets. As a result, utilities tend to perform well during recessions and economic downturns. Conversely, utility stocks tend to fall out of favor with the market during times of
economic growth
.
Utilities require a significant amount of expensive
infrastructure
and consequently carry large amounts of debt on their balance sheets. These
debt loads
make utilities hypersensitive to changes in the market
interest rate
. And because utilities are capital-intensive, they require a continuous inflow of funds to finance infrastructure upgrades and new asset purchases.
As of January 2025, higher inflation raised new challenges for utilities. During the inflation of the 1970s and 80s, utilities faced large debt, soaring fuel costs, blackouts, increased regulation, and
bankruptcies
. Utilities that succeed through economic challenges will likely continue to rank as stable assets due to steady demand.
2
Important
Although the sector appeals to a wide range of investors, utilities companies commonly attract income-producing investments.
How Investors Trade Utilities
Because utility stocks pay reliable dividends, investors often favor them over lower-dividend paying equities. After the
financial crisis
, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, to stimulate the economy.
3
As a result, investors flocked to utilities, as
safer investments
as utility companies are a viable defensive choice for investors during macroeconomic downturns.
If interest rates rise, investors can find higher-yielding alternatives than utilities. When a utility pays a
dividend yield
of 3% but increases in interest rates increase Treasury
bond yields
to 4%, the utility company would have to increase its dividend payout to match the rising yields.
Aside from investing in the individual stocks of utility companies, investors may also purchase regional utilities or invest in
exchange-traded funds
(ETFs) or sector funds containing a basket of utility stocks of companies located throughout the U.S.
The Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (FSUTX) includes the holdings of 31 utility companies as of January 2025 and $1.9 billion in assets.
4
The
Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund
(XLU) is one of the largest utility sector funds, with $17.6 billion in net assets, and is one of the most actively traded utility ETFs, with more than 2.4 million shares traded daily. The fund typically pays a dividend yield of around 3%.
5
The XLU's dividend yield beats the yield for the S&P 500 equity ETF, SPDR
S&P 500 Trust ETF
(SPY), which as of January 2025, pays around 1.16%.
Pros and Cons of the Utilities Sector
Utilities are stable investments that commonly provide a regular dividend to shareholders, making them a popular long-term
buy-and-hold
option. Dividend yields on utility stocks trend higher than those paid by other equities.
During times of economic downturns with low interest rates, utilities become attractive. They exhibit lower volatility and provide a desirable source of predictable investment returns from the dividends they pay on their shares.
Profit margins for utilities
can vary from company to company, depending on their location and the regulations they face.
Utilities, however, face intense regulatory oversight and require expensive infrastructure that needs routine updating and maintenance. To meet these infrastructure needs, utility companies often float debt products that, in turn, increase their debt loads. This debt also makes these services particularly sensitive to interest rate risk. Should rates rise, the company must offer higher yields to attract bond investors.
Pros
Stable, long-term investments and regular dividends
Safe investments during times of economic downturns
Various investment options including bonds, ETFs, and individual company stocks
Cons
Intense regulatory oversight
Expensive infrastructure that requires continual upgrades and maintenance
Become less attractive when interest rates are high and bond yields are high
Public Utility Companies
The utilities sector consists of companies that provide electricity, natural gas, water, sewage, and other services to homes and businesses. Public utilities are privately owned companies that are regulated by public utility commissions that operate at a variety of jurisdictional levels, usually at the state level.
These commissions are overseen by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. NARUC members are responsible for assuring reliable utility service at fair and reasonable rates.

How the Utilities Sector Is Changing
In 2020, former President Joe Biden called for the country to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050, committing nearly $2 trillion in investment to achieve this goal.
7
The energy and utility industry has an opportunity to advance its grid modernization and clean energy efforts by tapping into funds allocated in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which includes $65 billion earmarked for upgrading the national power infrastructure.
8
A 2022 industry outlook report by Deloitte identified five trends for the utilities industry which include enhanced competition, expansions in infrastructure, greater electrification of transportation, an emphasis on disaster readiness, and traditional energy players entering the renewable energy field.
9
According to Fidelity utility sector
portfolio manager
Douglas Simmons, the fundamentals of utilities in 2022 look very robust overall, driven by the ongoing shift toward renewable energy sources and away from fossil fuels.
10
Utilities remain wary of regulations that may force the closure of power plants, though the sector largely supported the
tax credits
proposed in a bill called Build Back Better, which aimed to provide more than $300 billion in direct
subsidies
for wind, solar, transmission, storage, carbon capture, and nuclear projects. Build Back Better failed to pass the Senate and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA appropriates $369 billion for climate and clean energy initiatives, including tax incentives that should reduce the costs of the renewable energy transition for utilities companies. However, the second Trump administration froze IRA funding, leaving many of the associated projects in financial limbo.

How Quickly Are Renewable Energy Resources Growing?
Renewable energy resources are expected to grow from 12% of the US energy mix as of 2021 to 39% by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley.
14
What Is a Public Utility?
Public utilities are regulated by the government or state under the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and commonly supply electricity, gas, or water to a region or area.
What Is the Largest Utility Company?
Globally, the largest utility is NextEra Energy, a provider of electricity-related services and a market capitalization of $150 as of 2025. Its principal subsidiary, FPL, is a rate-regulated utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy.

The Bottom Line
The utilities sector is an industrial category of stocks, consisting of companies that provide basic everyday amenities, including natural gas, electricity, water, and power. Typically, investors buy utilities stocks as long-term holdings. These equities typically feature stable prices and good dividend income. The movement toward ""clean"" energy, along with competition-enhancing legislation and a presidential administration committed to renewable energy resources, has some financial analysts forecasting strong growth for the utilities sector in the 2020s.

Investopedia,"Keogh Plan: Definition, Types, Pros, and Cons","Close
Definition
A Keogh plan is a tax-deferred retirement savings plan that is similar to a 401(k) plan but is designed for self-employed individuals.
What Is a Keogh Plan?
""Keogh plan"" is a term used to describe qualified plans that cover
self-employed
people. This includes
defined-benefit plans and defined-contribution plans
, though most plans are set as the latter. Contributions are generally tax-deductible up to a certain percentage of annual income, with applicable absolute limits in U.S. dollar terms, which the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
can change from year to year.
Key Takeaways
""Keogh plan"" is a term used to describe tax-deferred pension plans—either defined-benefit or defined-contribution—used by self-employed individuals.
Keogh plans have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) or 401(k) plans, but the contribution limits are higher, making Keogh plans a popular option for many high-income business owners.
Because current tax retirement laws do not set apart incorporated and self-employed plan sponsors, the term ""Keogh plan"" is rarely ever used.
Understanding Keogh Plans
Keogh plans are the same qualified plans other small businesses can use: the
defined-contribution plan
, which includes profit-sharing plans and money purchase plans, and the
defined-benefit plan
. However, the IRS calls them Keogh plans if they cover a self-employed individual.
1
Keogh plans can invest in the same set of securities as
401(k)s
and
individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
, including stocks, bonds,
certificates of deposit
(CDs), and
annuities
.
The term comes from U.S. Representative Eugene Keogh, who was instrumental in passing the Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962. Because the act was passed to ensure that self-employed people had access to retirement plans, any plans designed for them became known as Keogh plans. However, the distinction between corporate and other retirement plan sponsors was removed when the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was passed.
2
Fast Fact
As with other qualified retirement accounts, funds in a Keogh plan can be accessed as early as age 59½, and
withdrawals
must begin by age 73 or 75, depending on your birth year.
3
Types of Keogh Plans
Qualified Defined-Contribution Plans
Keogh plans can be set up as qualified defined-contribution plans, in which contributions are made on a regular basis up to a limit.
Profit-sharing plans
are one of the two types of Keogh plans that allow a business to contribute up to $69,000 as of 2024 ($66,000 in 2023).
4
A business does not have to generate profits to set aside money for this type of plan.

Money purchase plans
are less flexible compared to profit-sharing plans and require a business to contribute a fixed percentage of its income every year that is specified in plan documents. If a company alters its fixed percentage, it may face penalties. The contribution limit for 2024 for money purchase plans is set at 25% of annual compensation or $69,000, whichever is lower. In 2023, it was $66,000 or 25% of annual compensation, whichever was lower.
4
Qualified Defined-Benefit Plans
Qualified defined-benefit plans state the annual benefits to be received at retirement, and these benefits are typically based on salary and years of employment. Contributions towards defined-benefit Keogh plans are based on stated benefits and other factors, such as age and expected returns on plan assets. For 2024, the maximum annual benefit is $275,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is lower. For 2023, it was $265,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever was lower.
5
4
Pros and Cons of Keogh Plans
Keogh plans have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than
Simplified Employee Pension
(SEP) IRAs or 401(k) plans.
The key advantage to Keogh plans is that they have higher contribution limits, making them a popular option for many high-income business owners.
What Is the Difference Between a Keogh and an IRA?
Keogh plans are designed for self-employed people. While self-employed people can contribute to an IRA, Keogh plans have much higher contribution limits.
Who Is Eligible for a Keogh Plan?
Keogh plans are for self-employed people, so you can enroll in one if you're a sole proprietor, freelancer, or work for yourself.
Is a Keogh the Same As a Solo 401(k)?
A solo 401(k)—also called a one-participant 401(k)—is a regular 401(k) with a special calculation for a sole proprietor or small business with no employees. A Keogh plan has much higher contribution limits than a solo 401(k).
The Bottom Line
A Keogh plan is a retirement plan for self-employed people or unincorporated small businesses. They are generally defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.
Keogh plans can invest in the same instruments as other types of retirement plans, such as stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs), and annuities.

What Is Quantity Demanded?
Quantity demanded is a term used in economics to describe the total amount of a good or service that consumers demand over a given interval of time. It depends on the price of a good or service in a marketplace regardless of whether that market is in
equilibrium
.
The relationship between the quantity demanded and the price is known as the demand curve or simply the demand. The degree to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is referred to as the
elasticity
of demand.
Key Takeaways
Quantity demanded refers to the total amount of a good or service that consumers demand over a given period.
Quantity demanded depends on the price of a good or service in a marketplace.
The price of a product and the quantity demanded for that product have an inverse relationship according to the law of demand.
An increase in quantity demanded is caused by a decrease in the price of the product and vice versa.
Understanding Quantity Demanded
The price of a good or service in a marketplace determines the quantity that consumers demand.
Inverse Relationship of Price and Demand
A higher price results in a lower quantity demanded, and a lower price results in a higher quantity demanded, assuming that non-price factors are removed from the equation. The price of a product and the quantity demanded for that product have an inverse relationship as stated in the
law of demand
.
1
Important
An inverse relationship means that higher prices result in lower quantity demand and lower prices result in higher quantity demand.
Change in Quantity Demanded
A change in quantity demanded refers to a change in the specific quantity of a product that buyers are willing and able to buy. This change in quantity demanded is caused by a change in price.
Increase in Quantity Demanded
An increase in quantity demanded is caused by a decrease in the price of the product and vice versa. A
demand curve
illustrates the quantity demanded and any price offered on the market. A change in quantity demanded is represented as a movement along a demand curve. The proportion that quantity demanded changes relative to a change in price is known as the elasticity of demand. It’s related to the slope of the demand curve.
Julie Bang / Investopedia
Example of Quantity Demanded
Say that consumers buy two hot dogs per day at a price of $5 per hot dog. The quantity demanded is two. Then consumers only purchase one hot dog per day when vendors decide to increase the price of a hot dog to $6. The quantity demanded moves left on a graph from two to one when the price rises from $5 to $6.
But customers want to consume three hot dogs if the price decreases to $4 each. The quantity demanded moves rightward from two to three when the price falls from $5 to $4. We can construct a
demand curve
connecting the three points by graphing these combinations of price and quantity demanded.
Each combination of price and quantity demanded is depicted as a point on a downward-sloping line using a standard demand curve. The price of hot dogs appears on a y-axis, and the quantity of hot dogs is on an x-axis, indicating that the quantity demanded increases as the price decreases. Any change or movement to quantity demanded is involved as a movement of the point along the demand curve and not a shift in the demand curve itself.
Fast Fact
The demand curve effectively remains static as long as consumers’ preferences and other factors don’t change.
Price changes affect the quantity demanded. Changes in consumer preferences change the demand curve. The demand curve for traditional cars would inherently shift if environmentally conscious consumers switch from gas cars to electric cars.
Price Elasticity of Demand
The proportion to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is called elasticity of demand. A good or service that’s highly elastic indicates that the quantity demanded varies widely at different price points.
A good or service that’s
inelastic
is one with a quantity demanded that remains relatively static at varying price points. Insulin is an example of an inelastic good. Those who need insulin demand it at the same amount regardless of price point.
What Affects Quantity Demanded?
Quantity demanded is affected by the price of the product.
Demand
will go down if the price goes up. Demand will go up if the price goes down. Price and demand are inversely related.
Does Quantity Demanded Apply Only to Physical Goods?
No. Quantity demanded can apply to service products as well. A photographer should book more sessions if they offer family portrait sessions for a lower price. They’ll book fewer sessions if they price them higher.
What Is the Difference Between Demand and Quantity Demanded?
Demand and quantity demanded both pertain to purchasing but in different ways. Demand is how many of an item a consumer is willing to buy. It indicates the sheer quantity. How many items a consumer will purchase at a specific price is quantity demanded. Quantity demanded is a more detailed metric.
2
Demand is the entirety of the demand curve when graphed out. Quantity demanded is a single point.
How Does Quantity Demanded Factor Into a Demand Schedule?
A
demand schedule
is a table that shows the quantity demanded of a good or service at different price levels. A demand schedule can be graphed as a continuous demand curve on a chart where the y-axis represents price and the x-axis represents quantity, but it most commonly consists of two columns in which the first column lists the price for a product in ascending or descending order and the second column lists the
quantity of the product desired
or demanded at that price.
The Bottom Line
Quantity demanded is the amount of goods or services that consumers demand over a measurement of time. It depends on a product’s price. The relationship between the two is often referred to as the demand curve. A good or service can be inelastic if it’s immune to demand because consumers demand it regardless of its price.
As with so many other economic factors, the repercussions trickle down to consumers and their wallets.

Investopedia,"Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: What It Is, How to Calculate, Example","Close
What Is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio?
The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is an assessment of lending risk that financial institutions and other lenders examine before approving a mortgage. Typically, loan assessments with high LTV ratios are considered higher-risk loans. Therefore, if the mortgage is approved, the loan has a higher interest rate.
Additionally, a loan with a high LTV ratio may require the borrower to purchase
mortgage insurance
to offset the risk to the lender. This type of insurance is called private mortgage insurance (PMI).
Key Takeaways
Loan-to-value (LTV) is an often used ratio in mortgage lending to determine the amount necessary to put in a down payment and whether a lender will extend credit to a borrower.
Lower LTVs are better in the eyes of lenders, but require borrowers to come up with larger down payments.
Most lenders offer mortgage and home-equity applicants the lowest possible interest rate when the loan-to-value ratio is at or below 80%.
Mortgages become more expensive for borrowers with higher LTVs.
Fannie Mae's HomeReady and Freddie Mac's Home Possible mortgage programs for low-income borrowers allow an LTV ratio of 97% (3% down payment) but require mortgage insurance (PMI) until the ratio falls to 80%.
How to Calculate the Loan-to-Value Ratio

​
An LTV ratio is calculated by dividing the amount borrowed by the
appraised
value of the property, expressed as a percentage. For example, if you buy a home appraised at $100,000 for its appraised value, and make a $10,000
down payment
, you will borrow $90,000. This results in an LTV ratio of 90% (i.e., 90,000/100,000).
Understanding the Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio
Determining an LTV ratio is a critical component of mortgage
underwriting
. It may be used in the process of
buying a home
,
refinancing
a current mortgage into a new loan, or borrowing against accumulated
equity
within a property.
Lenders assess the LTV ratio to determine the level of exposure to risk they take on when underwriting a mortgage. When borrowers request a loan for an amount that is at or near the appraised value (and therefore has a higher LTV ratio), lenders perceive that there is a greater chance of the loan going into
default
. This is because there is very little equity built up within the property.
As a result, in the event of a
foreclosure
, the lender may find it difficult to sell the home for enough to cover the outstanding mortgage balance and still make a profit from the transaction.
Tip
The main factors impacting LTV ratios are the amount of the loan and the value of the property. A higher down payment (which reduces the loan amount) will result in a lower LTV ratio.
How LTV Is Used by Lenders
A LTV ratio is only one factor in determining eligibility for securing a mortgage, a
home equity loan
, or a
line of credit
. However, it can play a substantial role in the interest rate that a borrower is able to secure. Most lenders offer mortgage and home-equity applicants the lowest possible interest rate when their LTV ratio is at or below 80%.
1
A higher LTV ratio does not exclude borrowers from being approved for a mortgage, although the interest on the loan may rise as the LTV ratio increases. For example, a borrower with an LTV ratio of 95% may be approved for a mortgage. However, their interest rate may be higher than the interest rate given to a borrower with an LTV ratio of 75%.
If the LTV ratio is higher than 80%, a borrower may be required to purchase
private mortgage insurance (PMI)
. This can add anywhere from 0.5% to 1% to the total amount of the loan on an annual basis. For example, PMI with a rate of 1% on a $100,000 loan would add an additional $1,000 to the total amount paid per year (or $83.33 per month). PMI payments are required until the LTV ratio is 80% or lower. The LTV ratio will decrease as you pay down your loan and as the value of your home increases over time.
In general, the lower the LTV ratio, the greater the chance that the loan will be approved and the lower the interest rate is likely to be. In addition, as a borrower, it's less likely that you will be required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI).
While it is not a law that lenders require an 80% LTV ratio in order for borrowers to
avoid the additional cost of PMI
, it is the practice of nearly all lenders. Exceptions to this requirement are sometimes made for borrowers who have a high income, lower debt, or have a large investment portfolio.
< 80%
As a rule of thumb, a good loan-to-value ratio should be no greater than 80%. Anything above 80% is considered to be a high LTV, which means that borrowers may face higher borrowing costs, require private mortgage insurance, or be denied a loan. LTVs above 95% are often considered unacceptable.
Mortgage Example of LTV
For example, suppose you buy a home that appraises for $100,000. However, the owner is willing to sell it for $90,000. If you make a $10,000 down payment, your loan is for $80,000, which results in an LTV ratio of 80% (i.e., 80,000/100,000). If you were to increase the amount of your down payment to $15,000, your mortgage loan is now $75,000. This would make your LTV ratio 75% (i.e., 75,000/100,000).
Variations on LTV Ratio Rules
Different loan types may have different rules when it comes to LTV ratio requirements.
FHA Loans
FHA loans are mortgages designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers. They are issued by an FHA-approved lender and insured by the
Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
.
FHA loans require a lower minimum down payment and credit scores than many conventional loans. FHA loans allow an initial LTV ratio of up to 96.5%, but they require a
mortgage insurance premium (MIP)
that lasts for as long as you have that loan (no matter how low the LTV ratio eventually goes).
2
Many people decide to refinance their FHA loans once their LTV ratio reaches 80% in order to eliminate the MIP requirement.
VA and USDA Loans
VA and USDA loans—available to current and former military or those in rural areas—do not require private mortgage insurance even though the LTV ratio can be as high as 100%.
3
4
However, both VA and USDA loans do have additional fees.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
Fannie Mae's HomeReady and Freddie Mac's Home Possible mortgage programs for low-income borrowers allow an LTV ratio of 97%. However, they require mortgage insurance until the ratio falls to 80%.
5
6
For FHA, VA, and USDA loans, there are streamlined refinancing options available. These waive appraisal requirements so the home's LTV ratio doesn't affect the loan. For borrowers with an LTV ratio over 100%—also known as being ""underwater"" or ""upside down""—Fannie Mae's High Loan-to-Value Refinance Option and Freddie Mac's Enhanced Relief Refinance are also available options.
7
Important
Upfront fees on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac home loans changed in May 2023. Fees were increased for homebuyers with higher credit scores, such as 740 or higher, while they were decreased for homebuyers with lower credit scores, such as those below 640. Another change: Your down payment will influence what your fee is. The higher your down payment, the lower your fees, though it will still depend on your credit score. Fannie Mae provides the
Loan-Level Price Adjustments
on its website.
8
LTV vs. Combined LTV (CLTV)
While the LTV ratio looks at the impact of a single mortgage loan when purchasing a property, the
combined loan-to-value
(CLTV) ratio is the ratio of all
secured loans on a property to the value of a property. This includes not only the primary mortgage used in LTV but also any second mortgages, home equity loans or lines of credit, or other liens.
Lenders use the CLTV ratio to determine a prospective home buyer's risk of default when more than one loan is used—for example, if they will have two or more mortgages, or a mortgage plus a home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC). In general, lenders are willing to lend at CLTV ratios of 80% and above and to borrowers with high credit ratings. Primary lenders tend to be more generous with CLTV requirements since it is a more thorough measure.
Let's look a little closer at the difference. The LTV ratio only considers the primary mortgage balance on a home. Therefore, if the primary mortgage balance is $100,000 and the home value is $200,000, LTV = 50%.
Consider, however, the example if it also has a second mortgage in the amount of $30,000 and a HELOC of $20,000. The combined loan to value now becomes ($100,000 + $30,000 + $20,000 / $200,000) = 75%; a much higher ratio.
These combined considerations are especially important if the mortgagee defaults and goes into foreclosure.
What Is a Good LTV?
Most lenders use 80% as the threshold
for a good loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Anything below this value is even better. Note that borrowing costs can become higher, or borrowers may be denied loans, as the LTV rises above 80%.
What Are Disadvantages of Loan-to-Value?
The main drawback of the information that a LTV provides is that it only includes the primary mortgage that a homeowner owes, and does not include in its calculations other obligations of the borrower, such as a second mortgage or home equity loan.
Therefore, the CLTV is a more inclusive measure of a borrower's ability to repay a home loan.
What Does a 70% LTV Mean?
A 70% (0.70) loan-to-value (LTV) ratio indicates that the amount borrowed is equal to seventy percent of the value of the asset. In the case of a mortgage, it would mean that the borrower has come up with a 30% down payment and is financing the rest. For instance, a",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp

Definition
Liquidity ratios are a class of financial metrics used to determine a debtor's ability to pay off current debt obligations without raising external capital.
What Are Liquidity Ratios?
Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to pay its short-term debt obligations. They include the current ratio, the
quick ratio
, and the days sales outstanding ratio.
In general, a higher liquidity ratio shows a company is more liquid and has better coverage of outstanding debts.

Liquidity ratios can determine a debtor's ability to pay off current debt.
Common liquidity ratios include the quick ratio, current ratio, and days sales outstanding.
Liquidity ratios determine a company's ability to cover short-term obligations and cash flows, while solvency ratios are concerned with a longer-term ability to pay ongoing debts.

Understanding Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity is the ability to
convert assets into cash
quickly and cheaply. Liquidity ratios are most useful when they are used in comparative form. This analysis may be internal or external.
Internal analysis with liquidity ratios involves using multiple accounting periods that are reported using the same accounting methods. Comparing previous periods to current operations allows analysts to track changes in the business.
External analysis involves comparing the liquidity ratios of one company to another or to an entire industry. This information is useful in comparing the company's strategic positioning to its competitors when establishing
benchmark
goals.

Liquidity ratio analysis may not be as effective when looking across industries, as various businesses require different financing structures.
Liquidity ratio analysis is also less effective for comparing businesses of different sizes in different geographical locations.
Important
With liquidity ratios, current liabilities are most often compared to
liquid assets
to evaluate the ability to cover short-term debts and obligations in case of an emergency.
Types of Liquidity Ratios
The Current Ratio
The
current ratio
measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities (payable within one year) with its total current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventories.
The higher the ratio, the better the company's liquidity position.
Current Ratio
=
Current Assets
Current Liabilities
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
Current Ratio
=
Current Liabilities
Current Assets
​
The Quick Ratio
The
quick ratio
measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets and therefore excludes inventories from its current assets.
It is also known as the
acid-test
ratio.

\begin{aligned} &\text{Quick ratio} = \frac{C + MS + AR}{CL} \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &C=\text{cash \& cash equivalents}\\ &MS=\text{marketable securities}\\ &AR=\text{accounts receivable}\\ &CL=\text{current liabilities}\\ \end{aligned}

Another way to express this is:
Quick ratio
=
(

)
Current liabilities
\text{Quick ratio} = \frac{(\text{Current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses})}{\text{Current liabilities}}
Quick ratio
=
Current liabilities
(
Current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses
)
​
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
Days sales outstanding
(DSO) refers to the average number of days it takes a company to collect payment after it makes a sale.
A high DSO means that a company is taking unduly long to collect payment and is tying up capital in receivables.
DSOs are generally calculated on a quarterly or annual basis.
DSO
=
Average accounts receivable
Revenue per day
\text{DSO} = \frac{\text{Average accounts receivable}}{\text{Revenue per day}}
DSO
=
Revenue per day

Who Uses Liquidity Ratios?
Liquidity ratios' versatility makes them useful to a number of different users. The following stakeholders can each use liquidity ratios in distinct ways.
Investors:
Investors use liquidity ratios to assess the short-term financial health of companies that they're considering investing in. By evaluating a company's liquidity position, investors can see the company's ability to meet immediate financial obligations. This is important when trying to reduce the risk of default.
Creditors:
Creditors
, such as financial institutions, rely on liquidity ratios to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. By analyzing a company's liquidity position, creditors can assess the likelihood of timely repayment of loans. Higher liquidity ratios indicate a lower risk of default, providing creditors with greater confidence in extending credit to the company. Creditors may often impose liquidity ratio requirements as debt covenants.
Analysts:
Financial analysts use liquidity ratios as part of their comprehensive analysis of a company's financial performance and risk profile. By examining liquidity metrics, analysts can identify trends, assess potential liquidity risks, and make informed recommendations to investors or clients. Similar to individual investors, analysts attempt to evaluate the short-term health of a company prior to making decisions about that company.
Management:
Company management utilizes liquidity ratios to monitor and manage the organization's liquidity position. By tracking liquidity metrics regularly, management can identify liquidity gaps, optimize cash flow, and make informed decisions about short-term assets to carry.
Regulators and Authorities:
Regulators and governmental agencies may also use liquidity ratios as part of their oversight and regulatory functions. For instance, regulators impose restrictions on the minimum amount of cash a bank must have on hand at any given time.
1
Advantages and Disadvantages of Liquidity Ratios
Advantages
One of the primary advantages of liquidity ratios is their simplicity and ease of calculation. This makes them accessible to investors, creditors, and analysts.
These ratios offer a quick snapshot of a company's liquidity position without delving into complex financial analysis. For instance, the current ratio, which divides current assets by current liabilities, can quickly be determined with a company's balance sheet.
Another advantage of liquidity ratios is their utility in assessing a company's financial health and risk level. A high liquidity ratio suggests that a company possesses sufficient liquid assets to handle its short-term obligations comfortably.
A low liquidity ratio may signal potential liquidity issues. Though a company's financial health can't be boiled down to a single number, liquidity ratios can simplify the process of evaluating how a company is doing.
Liquidity ratios also facilitate comparison across companies and industries. By benchmarking liquidity ratios against industry averages or competitors' metrics, stakeholders can identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.
For instance, you can compare Microsoft's current ratio against Google's current ratio to gauge how each company may be structured differently. This can be an important part of deciding which company to invest in, especially if short-term health is one of your primary considerations.
Last, liquidity ratios can
communicate operational efficiency
. For instance, a declining liquidity ratio may indicate deteriorating financial health or inefficient
working capital management
. However, it may also mean a company is trying to hold onto less cash and deploy capital more rapidly to achieve growth.
Disadvantages
One drawback of liquidity ratios is that these ratios provide a static view of a company's liquidity position at a particular point in time. This means they don't consider the dynamic nature of business operations and cash flows.
For example, the current ratio may indicate sufficient liquidity based on current assets and liabilities, but it doesn't account for the timing of cash inflows and outflows. A company with hig",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityratios.asp

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis releases Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures quarterly and annually.
What Is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) includes consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investments. It functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a country’s economic health. GDP may be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights.
Real GDP
accounts for inflation, while
Nominal GDP
does not.
Key Takeaways
GDP helps measure the size of a country's economy and its growth rate.
The GDP growth rate compares the annual or quarterly change in a country’s economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing.
GDP increases when a country's exports exceed its imports.
Inflation may rise as GDP grows due to strengthening demand or a reduction in supply.
Zoe Hansen / Investopedia
Understanding Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The calculation of a country’s GDP encompasses all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign
balance of trade
. Exports are added to the value, and imports are subtracted.
1
Of all the components that make up a country’s GDP, the foreign balance of trade is especially important. The GDP of a country tends to increase when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers sell to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy. When this situation occurs, a country is said to have a
trade surplus
.
If the opposite situation occurs—that is, if the amount that domestic consumers spend on foreign products is greater than the total sum of what domestic producers can sell to foreign consumers—it is called a
trade deficit
. In this situation, the GDP of a country tends to decrease.
GDP can be computed on a nominal basis or a real basis, the latter accounting for
inflation
. Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing long-term national economic performance since it uses
constant dollars
.

Let’s say one country had a nominal GDP of $100 billion in 2014. By 2024, its nominal GDP grew to $150 billion. Prices also rose by 100% over the same period. In this example, if you look solely at its nominal GDP, the country’s economy appears to be performing well.
However, the real GDP (expressed in 2014 dollars) would only be $75 billion, revealing that an overall decline in real economic performance actually occurred during this time.
What Does GDP Tell You?
A country’s GDP represents the final market value of all the products and services that a country produces in a single year. Another way to measure GDP is as the sum of four factors: consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investment.
In the United States, GDP is calculated every three months by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
. The BEA makes its estimate based on price estimates, survey data, and other information collected by other agencies, such as the Census Bureau, Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Labor Statistics.
3
Types of GDP
GDP can be reported in several ways, each of which provides slightly different information.
Nominal GDP
Nominal GDP is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its calculation. In other words, it doesn’t strip out inflation or the pace of rising prices, which can inflate the growth figure.
All goods and services counted in nominal GDP are valued at the prices at which those goods and services are sold for in that year. Nominal GDP is evaluated in either the local currency or U.S. dollars at currency market exchange rates to compare countries’ GDPs in purely financial terms.
Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used. This is because, in effect, the removal of the influence of inflation allows the comparison of the different years to focus solely on volume.
Real GDP
Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the number of goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, with prices held constant from year to year to separate out the impact of inflation or
deflation
from the trend in output over time. Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services, it is subject to inflation.
Rising prices tend to increase a country’s GDP, but this does not necessarily reflect any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced. Thus, by looking just at an economy’s nominal GDP, it can be difficult to tell whether the figure has risen because of a real expansion in production or simply because prices rose.
Economists use a process that adjusts for inflation to arrive at an economy’s real GDP. By adjusting the output in any given year for the price levels that prevailed in a reference year, called the base year, economists can adjust for inflation’s impact. This way, it is possible to compare a country’s GDP from one year to another and see if there is any real growth.
Real GDP is calculated using a
GDP price deflator
, which is the difference in prices between the current year and the base year. For example, if prices rose by 5% since the base year, then the deflator would be 1.05. Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator, yielding real GDP. Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP because inflation is typically a positive number.
2
Real GDP accounts for changes in market value and thus narrows the difference between output figures from year to year. If there is a large discrepancy between a nation’s real GDP and nominal GDP, this may be an indicator of significant inflation or deflation in its economy.
GDP Per Capita
GDP per capita is a measurement of the GDP per person in a country’s population. It indicates that the amount of output or income per person in an economy can indicate average productivity or average living standards.
GDP per capita
can be stated in nominal, real (inflation-adjusted), or
purchasing power parity (PPP)
terms.
4
At a basic interpretation, per-capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each citizen. This also translates to a measure of overall national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure.
Per-capita GDP is often analyzed alongside more traditional measures of GDP. Economists use this metric for insight into their own country’s domestic productivity and the productivity of other countries. Per-capita GDP considers both a country’s GDP and its population. Therefore, it can be important to understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and affects per-capita GDP growth.
If a country’s per-capita GDP is growing with a stable population level, for example, it could be the result of technological progress that is producing more with the same population level. Some countries may have a high per-capita GDP but a small population, which usually means they have built up a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources.
GDP Growth Rate
The GDP growth rate compares the year-over-year (or quarterly) change in a country’s economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. Usually expressed as a percentage rate, this measure is popular for economic policymakers because GDP growth is thought to be closely connected to key policy targets such as inflation and unemployment rates.
5
If GDP growth rates accelerate, it may be a signal that the
economy
is overheating, and the central bank may seek to raise interest rates. Conversely,
central banks
see a shrinking (or negative) GDP growth rate (i.e., a recession) as a signal that rates should be lowered and that stimulus may be necessary.
GDP Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
While not directly a measure of GDP, economists look at PPP to see how one country’s GDP measures up in international dollars using a method that adjusts for differences in local prices and costs of living to make cross-country comparisons of real output, real income, and living standards.

Financial leverage is the process of taking on debt or borrowing funds to increase returns gained from an investment or a project.
What Is Financial Leverage?
Financial leverage is the practice of borrowing money, investing the funds, and planning for future returns to be greater than debt servicing costs. In this way, a company can use debt to generate more revenue, though at a risk. Leverage is often used when businesses invest in themselves for expansions, acquisitions, or other growth methods. It's also an investment strategy that uses various financial instruments or borrowed capital to increase the potential return on an investment.
Key Takeaways
Leverage refers to using debt or borrowed funds to amplify returns from an investment or project.
Companies can use leverage to invest in growth strategies.
Some investors use leverage to multiply their buying power in the market.
A range of financial leverage ratios gauge a company's financial strength with the most common being debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity.
Leverage is often associated with risk, as the higher levered a company is, the more financial risk they are taking on.
Investopedia / Lara Antal
How Financial Leverage Works
Leverage involves using
debt or borrowed
capital to undertake an investment or project. It's commonly used to boost an entity's equity base. The concept of leverage is used by both investors and companies:
Investors use leverage to significantly increase the returns that can be provided on an investment. They leverage their investments using various instruments including options, futures, and margin accounts.
Companies can use leverage to finance their assets. They can use debt financing to invest in business operations to influence growth instead of issuing stock to raise capital.
Investors who aren't comfortable using leverage directly can access leverage indirectly in a variety of ways. They can invest in companies that use leverage in the ordinary course of their business to finance or expand operations without increasing their outlay.
The point and result of financial leverage is to multiply the potential returns from a project. Leverage will also multiply the potential
downside risk
in case the investment doesn't pan out. It means that the item has more debt than equity when someone refers to a company, property, or investment as being ""highly leveraged.""

How to Calculate Financial Leverage
An entire suite of leverage financial ratios is used to calculate how much debt a company is leveraging in an attempt to maximize profits.
Debt Ratio
You can analyze a company's leverage by calculating its ratio of debt to assets. This ratio indicates how much debt it uses to generate its assets. A company has relied on leverage to finance its assets if the debt ratio is high. A ratio of 1.0 means that the company has $1 of debt for every $1 of assets. It has more assets than debt if it's lower than 1.0 and it has more debt than assets if it's higher than 1.0.
1
Debt Ratio
=
Total Debt
÷
Total Assets
\begin{aligned}&\textbf{Debt Ratio }\mathbf{=}\textbf{ Total Debt }\mathbf{\div}\textbf{ Total Assets}\end{aligned}
​
Debt Ratio
=
Total Debt
÷
Total Assets
​
You're using all debt, including short- and long-term debt vehicles when you calculate this ratio.
Debt-to-equity (D/E) Ratio
You can measure leverage by looking strictly at how assets have been financed instead of looking at what the company owns. The
debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio
is used to compare what the company has borrowed to what it has raised from private investors or shareholders.
Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
=
Total Debt
÷
Total Equity
\begin{aligned}&\textbf{Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio }\mathbf{=}\textbf{ Total Debt }\mathbf{\div}\textbf{ Total Equity}\end{aligned}
​
Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
=
Total Debt
÷
Total Equity
​
A D/E ratio greater than 1.0 means that a company has more debt than equity, but this doesn't necessarily mean that a company is highly leveraged.
Each company and industry typically operates in a specific way that may warrant a higher or lower ratio.
2
Startup technology companies might struggle to secure financing, and they must often turn to private investors. A debt-to-equity ratio of .5 or $1 of debt for every $2 of equity may therefore still be considered high for this industry.
Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio
You can also compare a company's debt to how much income it generates in a given period using its Earnings Before Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA). The debt-to-EBITDA ratio indicates how much income is available to pay down debt before these operating expenses are deducted from income.
A company with a high
debt-to-EBITDA
carries a great degree of debt compared to what the company earns. The higher the debt-to-EBITDA, the more leverage a company is carrying.
3
Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio
=
Debt
÷
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
\begin{aligned}&\textbf{Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio}\\&\qquad\mathbf{=}\textbf{Debt}\mathbf{\div}\textbf{Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization}\end{aligned}
​
Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio
=
Debt
÷
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
​
Important
An issue with using EBITDA is that it isn't an accurate reflection of earnings. It doesn't include expenses that must be accounted for. It's a non-GAAP measure that some companies use to create the appearance of higher profitability.
Equity Multiplier
Debt isn't directly considered in the
equity multiplier
but it's inherently included because total assets and total equity each have a direct relationship with total debt.
The equity multiplier attempts to understand the ownership weight of a company by analyzing how assets have been financed. A company with a low equity multiplier has financed a large portion of its assets with equity. It's not highly leveraged.
Equity Multiplier
=
Total Assets
÷
Total Equity
\begin{aligned}\textbf{Equity Multiplier }\mathbf{=}\textbf{ Total Assets }\mathbf{\div}\textbf{ Total Equity}\end{aligned}
Equity Multiplier
=
Total Assets
÷
Total Equity
​
DuPont analysis
uses the equity multiplier to measure financial leverage. You can calculate the equity multiplier by dividing a firm's total assets by its total equity. Then multiply the total financial leverage by the total asset turnover and the profit margin to produce the return on equity.
The equity multiplier is 2.0 or $500 million ÷ $250 million if a public company has total assets valued at $500 million and shareholder equity valued at $250 million. This shows that the company has financed half its total assets with equity.
4
Its equity multiplier would be 5.0, however, if it had $500 million in assets and equity of $100 million.
Larger equity multipliers
suggest that further investigation is needed because there might be more financial leverage used.
Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL)
Fundamental analysts can also use the
degree of financial leverage (DFL)
ratio. The DFL is calculated by dividing the percentage change of a company's earnings per share (EPS) by the percentage change in its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over a period.
Degree of Financial Leverage
=
%
Change in Earnings Per Share
÷
%
Change in EBIT
\begin{aligned}\textbf{Degree of Financial Leverage }&\mathbf{=\%}\textbf{ Change in Earnings Per Share}\\&\mathbf{\div\ \%}\textbf{ Change in EBIT}\end{aligned}
Degree of Financial Leverage
​
=
%
Change in Earnings Per Share
÷
%
Change in EBIT
​
The goal of DFL is to understand how sensitive a company's EPS is based on changes to operating income. A higher ratio indicates a higher degree of leverage and a company with a high DFL will likely have more volatile earnings.
5
Consumer Leverage Ratio
These formulas are used to evaluate a company's use of leverage for its operations but households can also use leverage by taking out debt and using personal income to cover interest charges.
Consumer leverage
is derived by dividing a household's debt by its disposable income. Households with a higher calculated consumer leverage have high degrees of debt compared to what they make and are therefore highly leveraged.
Consumer Leverage
=
Total Household Debt

Definition
Delivered-at-place (DAP) means that the seller in international trade takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location.
What Is Delivered-at-Place (DAP)?
The buyer is responsible for paying
import duties
and any applicable taxes, including clearance and local taxes, under the terms of a delivered-at-place (DAP) agreement. Payment comes due when the shipment has arrived at the cited destination. The phrase was introduced in the
International Chamber of Commerce's
(ICC) eighth publication of its Incoterms (international commercial terms) in 2010.
1
Key Takeaways
Delivered-at-place is an international trade term that was introduced in the International Chamber of Commerce's eighth publication of its Incoterms.
Under DAP, a seller agrees to pay all costs and suffer any potential losses of moving goods sold to a specific location.
In simpler terms, the seller takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location under DAP rules.
The buyer assumes all the risk and responsibility once the shipment arrives at the destination.
Incoterms help clear up any confusion concerning the rights and responsibilities of buyers and sellers of trade contracts.
How Delivered-at-Place (DAP) Works
Buyers and sellers often face complications when it comes to trade contracts, whether they are in the same country or not. As such, there are rules and regulations in place that clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each party in a financial contract. These are known as Incoterms—one of which is a delivered-at-place or DAP agreement.
DAP simply means that the seller takes on all the risks and costs of delivering goods to an agreed-upon location. This means they are responsible for anything associated with packaging, documentation, export approval, loading charges, and ultimate delivery. The buyer, in turn, takes over the
risk
and responsibility for unloading the goods and clearing them for
import
.
A delivered-at-place or DAP agreement is applicable for any form or combination of forms of transportation. It usually lists the point at which the buyer takes on financial responsibilities, such as “delivered-at-place, Port of Oakland.”
The term was introduced in 2010. At that time, DAP replaced the term
delivery duty unpaid
(DDU). While DDU may still be used colloquially, DAP is now the official term used in international trade.

The ICC sets out clear obligations for both buyers and sellers for each Incoterm. Below are the key responsibilities of each party.
Sellers
The seller is the one who bears most of the responsibilities when it comes to shipping under DAP contracts. This includes:
Documentation:
Under DAP rules, the seller must secure any documentation, including tallies of goods in the shipment, commercial invoicing as well as any packaging and marking related to the
export
of the shipment.
Licensing:
The seller must secure any licenses needed to export the goods and take care of any customs issues on their end.
Transport:
This category includes any pre-carriage of goods, the delivery to the port, loading onto the container, and main carriage/delivery to the destination.
Costs:
The seller must bear the cost of the shipment and must pay for any losses that may result during shipment.
Proof of Delivery:
This is provided by the seller to the buyer once the container arrives at the destination.
Buyers
While the seller does bear the brunt of the responsibilities under a DAP contract, there are certain things to which the buyer must adhere. These points include:
Payment:
The buyer must establish and pay the seller for the goods. They must also advise the seller of the destination.
Import:
Once the shipment arrives at the destination, the buyer must take care of any issues related to import. This includes any formalities, such as import forms.
Unloading:
The buyer must make arrangements to unload the cargo from the shipping vessel.
Costs:
The buyer bears the cost of import duties, taxes, and levies once the shipment arrives at its destination.
Transport:
Once unloaded, the buyer is responsible for transporting the goods from the destination/port to their next location. This can be a warehouse, storage facility, or retail location.

Importance of Incoterms
The ICC was founded in 1919. It established the
Incoterms
in 1936 as a way to facilitate domestic and international trade. Since then, the chamber released eight updates of these terms to remove obsolete terms. Delivered-at-place was one of those simplifications, as the definition applies regardless of the method of transport.
2
The main driver behind the ICC and the Incoterms is the need for a clear understanding of
counterparty
responsibilities in international contracts, particularly when it comes to who ships what and to where. With the ICC issuing concrete definitions, contracts can refer to the Incoterms, and the signing parties have a shared understanding of responsibilities.
Even with the clear guidelines for DAP arrangements, there are still situations that result in disputes, such as when the carrier of the goods incurs
demurrage
—a charge for failing to unload in time—as a result of not receiving the proper clearance from one of the parties.
In these cases, the fault usually lies with whichever party was amiss in providing timely documentation but determining that can be difficult, as documentation requirements are defined by the national and local authorities controlling ports and vary from country to country. Indeed, international trade law can be complex even with the benefit of defined contract terms.
What Does Delivered-at-Place Mean?
Delivered-at-place is one of the rules set out by the International Chamber of Commerce relating to international trade. Under this rule, the seller is responsible for preparing and transporting goods to the buyer's location and paying for the shipment as well as any losses that may result during transport. The buyer, on the other hand, must bear the cost of taxes, duties, and levies, and must unload the shipment upon arrival.
What Are Incoterms?
Incoterms are a set of rules for international trade. They are set up by the International Chamber of Commerce and outline the responsibilities of buyers and sellers of financial contracts in domestic and international markets. As such, they provide clarity when it comes to financial contracts between parties, especially when they are in different countries. Established in 1936, Incoterms are updated periodically. Examples of Incoterms include delivered-at-place, carriage and insurance paid to, and delivered duty paid.
2
What's the Difference Between DAP and DDP?
DAP and DDP are two Incoterms used in international trade. Under DAP or delivered-at-place, the buyer and seller share some of the responsibilities of the shipment of goods. The seller loads and ships goods to the buyer. They also bear the cost of transport and must pay for any losses that may result en route. Once the goods arrive at the destination, the buyer assumes control. This means they are responsible for any taxes, duties, or fees, and for unloading the cargo.
DDP or delivered duty paid works a little differently. Under this rule, the seller takes on all of the risk, responsibility, and costs associated with transport. This includes the cost of shipping, insurance, duties (import and export), and any other agreed-upon expenses with the buyer.
The Bottom Line
International trade can be very complicated and tricky. That's why the International Chamber of Commerce came up with Incoterms, which are a set of rules that are updated periodically. This list provides guidance to buyers and sellers on their rights and responsibilities when it comes to financial contracts.
Delivery-at-place is one such term. Under DAP, the seller bears much of the responsibility when it comes to the preparation and cost of shipping until the goods reach their destination. Upon arrival, the buyer takes over.

Investopedia,Ex-Dividend: Meaning and Date,"Close
Definition
The ex-dividend date is the deadline for investors to own a stock to receive a declared dividend.
What Is Ex-Dividend?
A dividend is a cash payment to shareholders as a reward for investing in company stock or
equity
shares. Ex-dividend means a company's dividend allocations have been specified. The ex-dividend date or ""ex-date"" is usually one business day before the record date.
Investors who purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after will not receive the next
dividend
payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. Investors only get dividends if they buy the stock before the ex-dividend date.
Key Takeaways
Ex-dividend means a company's dividend allocations have been specified.
The ex-dividend date is when the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.
Investors who purchase stock before the ex-dividend date are entitled to the next dividend payment, while those who purchase stock on or after the ex-dividend date are not.
Ex-Dividend Date
A stock trades ex-dividend on and after the ex-dividend date or
ex-date
. Investors who buy a stock on the ex-dividend date or after will not receive the next dividend payment. Since buyers aren't entitled to the next dividend payment on the ex-date, the stock will be priced lower by the amount of the dividend by the exchange.
1
Tip
Some
broker platforms might use an XD suffix
to the stock's ticker to indicate it is trading ex-dividend.
Declaring Dividends
When a company declares a dividend, its board of directors establishes a record date when investors must be on record as shareholders to receive the dividend payment. Once the record date is set, the ex-dividend date is also determined according to the exchange rules on which the stock is traded.
The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date. For example, if a company declares a dividend on March 3 with a record date of Monday, April 11, the ex-dividend date would be Friday, April 8, because it’s one business day before the record date.

The ex-dividend date is before the record date because of how stock trades are settled.

After a stock trade, the transaction isn't settled for one business day, known as the ""
T+1
"" settlement. Investors with stock on Thursday, April 7 that is sold on Friday, April 8 would still be the
shareholder of record
on Monday, April 11, because the trade hasn't settled. However, if the stock sold on Wednesday, April 6, the trade would be settled on Thursday, April 7, before the ex-dividend date of Friday, April 8, and the new buyer would be entitled to the dividend.
Investopedia / Julie Bang.
Stock Price and Ex-Dividend
On average, a stock price will drop slightly less than the dividend amount. Given that stock prices move daily, the fluctuation caused by small dividends may be difficult to detect. The effect on stocks from larger dividend payments can be easier to observe.
If a company issues a dividend in stock instead of cash or the
cash dividend
is 25% or more of the value of the stock, the ex-dividend date rules differ. With a stock or large cash dividend, the ex-dividend date is set on the first business day after the dividend is paid.
1
Important
Stock trades do not actually
settle
until the day after a transaction.
Key Dividend-Related Dates
Declaration date:
This is the date when a company's board of directors announces the dividend distribution. Any change in the expected dividend can cause the stock to rise or fall quickly as traders adjust their expectations. The ex-date and record date will occur after the declaration date.
Record date:
This is when the company reviews who the shareholders of record are. The record date is one business day after the ex-date.
Payment date:
Dividend checks are sent or credited to investor accounts.
Explain Like I'm Five
A dividend is when a company distributes part of its earnings to shareholders. Dividends are announced well in advance, and some investors buy stocks specifically to collect the dividend.
You must own a stock before the ex-dividend date to qualify for a dividend, meaning that you must buy it the day before or earlier. Investors who buy shares on or after the ex-date will not receive the dividend.
What Is an Example of a Dividend Payment?
Suppose Company XYZ pays a $0.53 per share dividend on June 2, 2024. The payment goes to shareholders who had purchased stock before the ex-date of May 5, 2024. The company declared the dividend on Feb. 19, 2024, and the record date was set as May 6, 2024. Only shareholders who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend date are entitled to the payment.
Why Does the Stock Price Fall on the Ex-Dividend Date?
The price of a stock tends to rise before an ex-dividend date, to reflect the additional value of the payout. After the ex-date, the share price tends to drop by a similar amount because there is no longer an expected payout.
How Does the Ex-Dividend Date Help Investors?
If an investing strategy is focused on income, knowing when the ex-date occurs helps investors plan their trade entries. However, because the stock's price drops by about the same value as the dividend,
buying a stock right before
the ex-date shouldn't result in any profits. The same applies if investors buy on or after the ex-date and get a ""discount"" for the dividend they won’t receive.
The Bottom Line
The ex-dividend date is one of four steps a company follows when paying dividends. The declaration date is when a company announces its plans for a dividend. The record date is when the company determines which shareholders are entitled to a dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually the day before the record date. The payment date is the day when dividend payments are made.
Correction—Nov. 28, 2023:
This article has been corrected to state the date when a new buyer would be entitled to a dividend.

Definition
Gross margin is the percentage of money a company keeps from its sales after covering the direct costs of producing its goods or services. It shows how efficiently a business turns revenue into profit before accounting for overhead and other expenses.
What Is Gross Margin?
Gross margin is the percentage of a company's revenue that's retained after direct expenses such as labor and materials have been subtracted. It's an important profitability measure that looks at a company's
gross profit
as compared to its revenue.
Gross profit is determined
by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue. The higher the gross margin, the more revenue a company retains. It can then use the revenue to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations.
Key Takeaways
Gross margin measures a company's gross profit compared to its revenues as a percentage.
A higher gross margin means a company retains more capital.
A company may cut labor costs or source cheaper suppliers if its gross margin drops.
Gross margin focuses on revenue and COGS, unlike the net profit margin, which takes all of a business's expenses into account.

Net Sales is the equivalent to revenue or the total amount of money generated from sales for the period. It can also be referred to as net sales because it can include discounts and deductions from returned merchandise. Revenue is typically called the top line because it appears at the top of the income statement. Costs are subtracted from revenue to calculate net income or the bottom line.
COGS stands for ""cost of goods sold."" The direct costs associated with producing goods include both direct labor costs and any costs of materials used in producing or manufacturing a company’s products.
Imagine that a business collects $200,000 in sales revenue. Let's assume that the cost of goods consists of the $100,000 it spends on manufacturing supplies. The gross profit is, therefore, $100,000 after subtracting its COGS from sales. The gross margin is 50% or ($200,000 - $100,000) ÷ $200,000.
What Gross Margin Can Tell You
A company's gross margin is the percentage of
revenue
after COGS. It's calculated by dividing a company's gross profit by its sales. Gross profit is a company's revenue less the cost of goods sold. A company's gross margin is 35% if it retains $0.35 from each dollar of revenue generated.

COGS has already been taken into account so those remaining funds can consequently be channeled toward paying debts, general and administrative expenses, interest fees, and dividend distributions to shareholders.
Companies use gross margin to measure how their production costs relate to their revenues. A company might strive to slash labor costs or source cheaper suppliers of materials if its gross margin is falling, or it may decide to increase prices as a revenue-increasing measure.
Gross profit margins can also be used to measure company efficiency or compare two companies with different market capitalizations.
Fast Fact
Gross margin may also be referred to as gross profit margin.
Gross Margin vs. Net Margin
Gross margin focuses solely on the relationship between revenue and COGS, but
net margin
or net profit margin is a little different. A company's net margin takes all of a business's expenses into account. It's the percentage of net income earned from revenues received.
Businesses subtract their COGS as well as ancillary expenses when calculating net margin and related margins. Some of these expenses include product distribution, sales representative wages, miscellaneous
operating expenses
, and taxes.
Gross margin helps a company assess the profitability of its manufacturing activities. Net profit margin helps the company assess its overall profitability. Companies and investors can determine whether the operating costs and overhead are in check and whether enough profit is generated from sales.
Gross Margin vs. Gross Profit
Gross margin and gross profit are among the metrics that companies can use to measure their profitability. Both of these figures can be found on corporate financial statements and specifically on a company's income statement. They're commonly used interchangeably, but these two figures are different.
Gross margin is a profitability measure that's expressed as a percentage. Gross profit is expressed as a dollar figure. Gross profit can be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from a company's revenue. It sheds light on how much money a company earns after factoring in
production
and sales costs.
How Do You Calculate Gross Margin?
Gross margin is expressed as a percentage. First, subtract the cost of goods sold from the company's revenue. This figure is the company's gross profit expressed as a dollar figure. Divide that figure by the total revenue and multiply it by 100 to get the gross margin.
What's the Difference Between Gross Margin and Gross Profit?
The terms gross margin and gross profit are often used interchangeably, but they're two separate metrics that companies use to measure and express their profitability. Both factor in a company's revenue and the cost of goods sold, but they're a little different. Gross profit is
revenue less the cost of goods sold
and is expressed as a dollar figure. A company's gross margin is the gross profit compared to its sales and is expressed as a percentage.
What Is a Good Gross Margin?
The gross margin varies by industry. Service-based industries tend to have higher gross margins and gross profit margins because they don't have large amounts of COGS. The gross margin for manufacturing companies will be lower because they have larger COGS.
The Bottom Line
Different metrics can be used to measure a company's profitability. Gross margin is just one of these figures. Gross margin may also be called gross profit margin. It looks at a company's gross profit compared to its revenue or sales and is expressed as a percentage.
This figure can help companies understand whether there are any inefficiencies and if cuts are required to address them and increase profits. The gross margin is also a way for investors to determine whether a company is a good investment.

Definition
Multilevel marketing is a business model where independent distributors sell products and recruit others, earning commissions on both personal sales and the sales of their network.
If you've ever wondered why your neighbor suddenly started selling essential oils or why your college roommate keeps inviting you to join ""exciting"" business opportunities, you'll want to know about multilevel marketing (MLM). It's a controversial industry whose annual valuation is subject to debate—figures range from $35 billion a year for the industry into the hundreds of billions—and where words like ""cult,"" ""scheme,"" and ""scam"" are often tossed around, even if particular enterprises are safely on this side of the law.
1

3
Companies like Amway Corporation, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd., and Mary Kay Inc., have become household names with millions of distributors worldwide. But the question remains: Is MLM a legitimate path to
entrepreneurship
or a predatory scheme targeting vulnerable individuals? This article dives into how to separate the legitimate forms of the business from the red flags that should send you running.
Key Takeaways
MLM is an industry worth at least tens of billions annually where independent distributors sell products directly to consumers and recruit others into their network, earning from both personal sales and their downline's performance.
According to U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data, at least 99% of MLM participants lose money or earn minimal income.
Legitimate MLMs focus primarily on product sales to genuine consumers, maintain reasonable startup costs, and provide transparent income disclosures.
More questionable MLMs emphasize recruitment over retail sales and may require significant purchases to maintain ""active"" status. Stay away from these.
What Is Multilevel Marketing?
MLM,
network marketing
, or direct selling is a business model in which independent distributors sell products or services directly to consumers while recruiting new distributors into their network. Under this model, distributors earn income from two primary sources—their personal sales and commissions based on the sales made by their recruits (known as their ""downline"").
4
This creates multiple levels of earnings potential, with those at higher ranks earning from many levels below them. That's why lay people often confuse MLMs with
pyramid schemes
. According to the Direct Selling Education Foundation, about 13 million people in the U.S. were MLM participants in 2023, and other studies have found that about one in 13 American adults has participated in an MLM organization at some point in their lives.
5
6
A 2024
Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
report that analyzed 70 income disclosure statements of dozens of MLMs found that most MLM participants make less than $1,000 per year. In addition, while most MLM income disclosure statements don't account for expenses incurred by participants, the FTC noted that these costs often outstrip the income for many involved.

The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.
The FTC also found that many firms' disclosure statements were ""misleading"" at best. A sampling of the report's subject headings gives an idea of why:
""Most Depict an Income Distribution that Excludes Some Participants Who Received Little or No Income""
""Most Income Figures Do Not Account for Expenses""
""Most Emphasize the High Income of a Small Number of Participants""
""Most Present Income Data in Potentially Confusing or Ambiguous Ways""
""Many Income Disclosure Statements Disclose Important Information Inconspicuously""
""Many Make Claims for Which the Basis of the Claim Is Not Immediately Apparent""
""Analysis of the Data and Fine Print Reveal that Many Participants Had No Reported Income or Only Limited Reported Income""
3
Warning
The key difference between legitimate and illegitimate MLMs is that the former focus primarily on selling actual products to end consumers while the latter are typically MLM pyramid schemes that emphasize recruitment with little regard for genuine retail sales.
How Multilevel Marketing Works
MLMs are a structured network of independent distributors who sell products and recruit new members. Here's how the MLM
business model
typically works:
1.
Company structure
: An MLM company develops products or services and establishes a compensation plan that rewards direct sales and recruitment activities.
2.
Distributor recruitment
: Individuals join as independent distributors (not employees) by buying starter kits or initial inventory. They pay membership fees and often commit to regular product purchases to remain ""active"" in the system.
3.
Dual income streams
: Distributors earn money through:
Direct sales
commissions
from selling products to customers
Commissions and bonuses based on the sales generated by people they recruit (their ""downline"")
4. Rank advancement
: Distributors advance through company-defined ranks (often with names like ""silver,"" ""gold,"" and ""diamond"") based on personal sales volume and the performance of their downline network.
3
5. Training and support
: Upline members typically train their recruits, focusing on product knowledge and recruitment techniques. Companies also often host motivational events and provide marketing materials.
6. Compensation plans
: These complex structures determine how commissions flow upward through multiple levels. The FTC has found that in many MLMs, significant income is only possible through building and maintaining a large downline, not through product sales alone.
3

7
Tip
Before participating in one, research specific MLMs through the FTC and Better Business Bureau to identify red flags. If in doubt, go elsewhere: there are plenty of ways to use your limited time and funds to earn legitimate income.
Examples of Multilevel Marketing
Several well-established companies use the multilevel marketing business model across various product categories. Here are some prominent examples:
Tupperware
, which filed for bankruptcy in 2024, is one of the most recognizable MLM companies, known for its plastic food storage containers. The company pioneered the ""home party"" sales model, where consultants demonstrate products in social settings.
8
Tupperware says that these parties occur frequently worldwide, with consultants earning commissions on direct sales while building their own sales teams.
9
Amway
, founded in 1959, is likely the largest network marketing company globally with annual revenue of about $1.5 billion.
10
11
The company offers health, beauty, and home care products. Its ""independent business owners"" (IBOs) buy products at wholesale prices for resale and can build downlines of other IBOs, earning from personal sales and their network's performance.
12
LuLaRoe
, a clothing MLM, has faced significant legal challenges. It was also the subject of a documentary on Amazon Prime, ""LuLaRich.""
13
In 2019, after the Washington state attorney general filed a lawsuit alleging the company operated as a pyramid scheme, LuLaRoe settled for $4.75 million and agreed to make significant changes to its business practices.
14
15
Herbalife Nutrition
's distributors often establish ""nutrition clubs"" to sell products and recruit new members.
16
In 2016, Herbalife agreed to pay $200 million in consumer redress and restructure its multilevel marketing operations to settle FTC charges, with the settlement requiring the company to base distributor compensation primarily on verifiable retail sales rather than recruitment.
17
Tip
""MLMs, like viruses, morph and adapt to their new regulatory environment to achieve facial compliance with federal and state laws,"" one recent study argued. They ""are the mighty morphing, antibiotic-resistant, Jason Voorhees iteration of the direct selling business model. Just like the killer demon, Jason, in the
Friday the 13th
horror movies, '[I]t doesn't matter if he's decapitated, cremated, or exploded—Jason always comes back,' and so too does the multilevel marketing business model.""
7
How To Identify Problem MLMs
Distinguishing between legitimate MLM businesses and predatory schemes requires careful evaluation:
Revenue focus
: Be wary if the emphasis is on recruitment rather than product sales to actual customers.
Income claims
: Be skeptical of promises of significant or easy income. According to FTC data, 99% of MLM participants earn little to no money, w",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multi-level-marketing.asp

by the U.S. Treasury to stabilize the country’s financial system, restore economic growth, and mitigate
foreclosures
in the wake of the
2008 financial crisis
. TARP sought to achieve these targets by purchasing troubled companies’ assets and stock.
Key Takeaways
The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was instituted by the U.S. Treasury following the 2008 financial crisis.
TARP stabilized the financial system by having the government buy mortgage-backed securities and bank stocks.
From 2008 to 2010, TARP invested $426.4 billion in firms and recouped $441.7 billion in return.
TARP was controversial at the time, and its effectiveness continues to be debated.
How the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Worked
Global credit markets came to a near standstill in September 2008 as several major financial institutions, such as
Fannie Mae
,
Freddie Mac
, and American International Group (AIG), experienced severe financial problems.
Lehman Brothers
went bankrupt, and investment companies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley changed their
charters
to become commercial banks in an attempt to stabilize their capital situations.

To prevent the situation from completely spiraling out of control, Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson
pioneered the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008, with the passage of the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
.

TARP's original purpose was to increase the liquidity of the money markets and
secondary mortgage markets
by purchasing the
mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
, and through that, reduce the potential losses of the institutions that owned them.
Later, TARP's aim was modified slightly to allow the government to buy equity in banks and other financial institutions. TARP initially gave the Treasury purchasing power of $700 billion; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (simply referred to as
Dodd-Frank
) later reduced the $700 billion authorization to $475 billion.
5
Important
TARP funds were used to purchase stock in banks, insurance companies, and auto-makers, and to loan funds to financial institutions and homeowners.
6
The U.S. government bought
preferred stock
in eight banks: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo. The banks were required to give the government a 5% dividend that would increase to 9% in 2013, encouraging banks to buy back the stock within five years.
7
From the program’s inception until October 3, 2010 (the deadline for extending funds), $245 billion was used to stabilize banks, $27 billion went to programs to increase credit availability, $80 billion went to the U.S. auto industry (specifically, GM and Chrysler), $68 billion was used to stabilize AIG, and $46 billion went to foreclosure-prevention programs, such as Making Home Affordable.
5
8
The provisions of TARP demanded that companies involved lose certain tax benefits and, in many cases, placed limits on executive compensation and forbade fund recipients from awarding bonuses to their top 25 highest-paid executives.
9
Even so, by 2009, bailed-out firms paid some $20 billion to key personnel—sardonically referred to as
TARP bonuses
.
10
The Legacy of TARP
When the Treasury wrapped up TARP, the government concluded that its investments had earned more than $11 billion for taxpayers by 2010.
11
To be more specific, TARP recovered funds totaling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested. The government also claimed that TARP prevented the American auto industry from failing and saved more than one million jobs, helped stabilize banks, and restored credit availability for individuals and businesses.
12
Fast Fact
TARP is still controversial. Advocates say it saved the U.S. financial system and shortened the financial crisis while critics charge the initiative just gave Wall Street an unnecessary boost.
Even so, economists, politicians, and financial professionals still debate TARP's merits and wonder if it had been necessary. Critics charge the program did little to help the housing markets, which remained depressed for years. Some say it did not go far enough—that the government should have insisted on an equity stake in the financial firms it was bailing out to control their future practices.
Instead, critics opine that TARP's no-strings loans essentially acted as a reward for bad behavior, sending a message of ""act irresponsibly and we'll help you out""—and establishing a dangerous precedent of dependency.
TARP also did not endear the government to the American public, which saw Wall Street reap benefits—including those notorious bonuses—and return to profitability, even as individuals struggled with debt, unemployment, and foreclosures in the wake of the Great Recession.

Definition
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method for determining whether differences in group means are statistically significant or likely due to random variation.
What Is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)?
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test used to assess the difference between the means of more than two groups. At its core, ANOVA allows you to simultaneously compare
arithmetic means
across groups. You can determine whether the differences observed are due to random chance or if they reflect genuine, meaningful differences.
A one-way ANOVA uses one independent variable. A two-way ANOVA uses two independent variables. Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable in a regression study.
While this can sound arcane to those new to statistics, the applications of ANOVA are as diverse as they are profound. From medical researchers investigating the efficacy of new treatments to marketers analyzing
consumer preferences
, ANOVA has become an indispensable tool for understanding complex systems and making data-driven decisions.
Key Takeaways
ANOVA is a statistical method that simultaneously compares means across several groups to determine if observed differences are due to chance or reflect genuine distinctions.
A one-way ANOVA uses one independent variable. A two-way ANOVA uses two independent variables.
By partitioning total variance into components, ANOVA unravels relationships between variables and identifies true sources of variation.
ANOVA can handle multiple factors and their interactions, providing a robust way to better understand intricate relationships.
Xiaojie Liu / Investopedia
How ANOVA Works
An ANOVA test can be applied when data needs to be experimental. Analysis of variance is employed if there is no access to statistical software, and ANOVA must be calculated by hand. It's simple to use and best suited for small samples involving subjects, test groups, and between and among groups.
ANOVA is like several two-sample
t-tests
. However, it results in fewer
type I errors
. ANOVA groups differences by comparing each group's means and includes spreading the variance into diverse sources.

Analysts use a one-way ANOVA with collected data about one independent variable and one dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA uses two independent variables. The independent variable should have at least three different groups or categories. ANOVA determines if the dependent variable changes according to the level of the independent variable.
Researchers might test students from several colleges to see if students from one of them consistently outperform students from the other schools. In a business application, a research and development researcher might test two ways of creating a product to see if one is better than the other in cost efficiency.
ANOVA's versatility and ability to handle multiple variables make it a valuable tool for researchers and analysts across various fields. By comparing means and partitioning variance, ANOVA provides a robust way to understand the relationships between variables and identify significant differences among groups.

History of ANOVA
The t- and
z-test methods
developed in the 20th century were used for statistical analysis. In 1918, Ronald Fisher created the analysis of variance method.
1
For this reason, ANOVA is also called the Fisher analysis of variance, and it's an extension of the t- and z-tests. The term became well-known in 1925 after appearing in Fisher's book, ""Statistical Methods for Research Workers."" It was first employed in experimental psychology and later expanded to other subjects.
2
The ANOVA test is the first step in analyzing factors that affect a given data set. Once the test is finished, an analyst performs further testing on the factors that measurably might be contributing to the data's inconsistency. The analyst utilizes the ANOVA test results in an F-test to generate further data that aligns with the proposed
regression
models.

Investopedia,Tenancy In Common (TIC): How It Works and Other Forms of Tenancy,"Close
What Is Tenancy in Common (TIC)?
Tenancy in common (TIC) is a legal arrangement in which two or more parties share ownership rights to real property. It comes with what might be a significant drawback, however: A TIC carries no rights of survivorship. Each independent owner can control an equal or different percentage of the total property during their lifetimes.
Tenancy in common is one of three types of shared ownership. The others are joint tenancy and tenancy by entirety.
Key Takeaways
Tenancy in common (TIC) is a legal arrangement in which two or more parties have ownership interests in a real estate property or a parcel of land.
Tenants in common can own different percentages of the property.
A tenancy in common doesn't carry survivorship rights.
1
Tenants in common can bequeath their share of the property to a named beneficiary upon their death.
Joint tenancy and tenancy by entirety are two other types of ownership agreements.
How Tenancy in Common (TIC) Works
Owners as tenants in common share interests and privileges in all areas of the property but each tenant can own a different percentage or proportional financial share.
Tenancy in common agreements can be created at any time. An additional individual can join as an interest in a property after the other members have already entered into a TIC arrangement. Each tenant can also independently sell or borrow against their portion of ownership.
Important
A tenant in common can't claim ownership to any specific part of the property even though the percentage of the property owned can vary.
A deceased tenant's or co-owner's share of the property passes to their estate when they die rather than to the other tenants or owners because this type of ownership doesn't include rights of survivorship. The tenant can name their co-owners as their
estate beneficiaries
for the property, however.
Dissolving Tenancy in Common
One or more tenants can buy out the other tenants to dissolve the tenancy in common by entering into a joint legal agreement. A partition action may take place that might be voluntary or court-ordered in cases where an understanding can't be reached.
A court will divide the property as a partition in kind in a legal proceeding, separating the property into parts that are individually owned and managed by each party. The court won't compel any of the tenants to sell their share of the property against their will.
The tenants may consider entering into a partition of the property by sale if they can't agree to work together. The holding is sold in this case and the proceeds are divided among the tenants according to their respective shares of the property.
Property Taxes Under Tenancy in Common
A tenancy in common agreement doesn't legally divide a parcel of land or property so most tax jurisdictions won't separately assign each owner a proportional property tax bill based on their ownership percentage. The tenants in common typically receive a single
property tax
bill.
A TIC agreement imposes joint-and-several liability on the tenants in many jurisdictions where each of the independent owners may be liable for the property tax up to the full amount of the assessment. The liability applies to each owner regardless of the level or percentage of ownership.
Tenants can deduct payments from their
income tax
filings. Each tenant can deduct the amount they contributed if the taxing jurisdiction follows joint-and-several liability. They can deduct a percentage of the total tax up to their level of ownership in counties that don't follow this procedure.
Other Forms of Tenancy
Two other forms of shared ownership are commonly used instead of tenancies in common: joint tenancy and tenancy by entirety.
Joint Tenancy
Tenants obtain equal shares of a property in a joint tenancy with the same deed at the same time. Each owns 50% if there are two tenants. The property must be sold and the proceeds distributed equally if one party wants to buy out the other.
The ownership portion passes to the individual's estate at death in a tenancy in common. The title of the property passes to the surviving owner in a joint tenancy. This type of ownership comes with rights of survivorship.
Some states set joint tenancy as the default property ownership for married couples. Others use the tenancy in common model.
Tenancy by Entirety
A third method that's used in some states is
tenancy by entirety
(TBE). The property is viewed as owned by one entity. Each spouse has an equal and undivided interest in the property under this legal arrangement if a married couple is in a TBE agreement.
Unmarried parties both have equal 100% interest in the property as if each is a full owner.
Fast Fact
Contract terms for tenancies in common are detailed in the
deed
,
title
, or other legally binding property ownership documents.
Pros and Cons of Tenancy in Common
Buying a home with a family member or a business partner can make it easier to enter the
real estate market
. Dividing deposits, payments, and maintenance make real estate investment less expensive.
All borrowers sign and agree to the loan agreement when mortgaging property as tenants in common, however. The lender may seize the holdings from all tenants in the case of
default
. The other borrowers are still responsible for the full payment of the loan if one or more borrowers stop paying their share of the mortgage loan payment.
Using a
will
or other estate plan to designate beneficiaries to the property gives a tenant control over their share but the remaining tenants may subsequently own the property with someone they don't know or with whom they don't agree. The heir may file a partition action, forcing the unwilling tenants to sell or divide the property.
Pros
Facilitates property purchases
The number of tenants can change
Different degrees of ownership are possible
Cons
No automatic survivorship rights
All tenants are equally liable for debt and taxes
One tenant can force the sale of property
Example of Tenancy in Common
California allows four types of ownership that include
community property
, partnership, joint tenancy, and tenancy in common. TIC is the default form among unmarried parties or other individuals who jointly acquire property. These owners have the status of tenants in common unless their agreement or contract expressly otherwise states that the arrangement is a partnership or a joint tenancy.
2
TIC is one of the most common types of homeownership in San Francisco, according to SirkinLaw, a San Francisco real estate law firm specializing in co-ownership. TIC conversions have become increasingly popular in other parts of California, too, including Oakland, Berkeley, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Laguna Beach, San Diego, and throughout Marin and Sonoma counties.
3
What Benefit Does Tenancy in Common Provide?
Tenancy in common (TIC) is a legal arrangement in which two or more parties jointly own a piece of real property such as a building or parcel of land. The key feature of a TIC is that a party can sell their share of the property while also reserving the right to pass on their share to their heirs.
What Happens When One of the Tenants in Common Dies?
The ownership share of the deceased tenant is passed on to that tenant’s estate and handled according to provisions in the deceased tenant’s will or other estate plan. Any surviving tenants would continue owning and occupying their shares of the property.
What Is a Common Dispute Among Tenants In Common?
TIC tenants share equal rights to use the entire property regardless of their ownership percentage. Maintenance and care are divided evenly despite ownership share. Problems can arise when a minority owner overuses or misuses the property.
The Bottom Line
Tenancy in Common is one of three types of ownership where two or more parties share interest in real estate or land. Owners as tenants in common share interests and privileges in all areas of the property regardless of each tenant's financial or proportional share. A tenancy in common doesn't carry rights of survivorship so one tenant's ownership doesn't automatically pass to the other tenants if one of them dies.

What Is Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)?
Days sales outstanding (DSO) is a measure of the average number of days that it takes a company to collect payment for a sale. DSO is often determined on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.
To compute DSO, divide the average accounts receivable during a given period by the total value of credit sales during the same period, and then multiply the result by the number of days in the period being measured.
Days sales outstanding is an element of the
cash conversion cycle
and may also be referred to as days receivables or
average collection period
.
Key Takeaways
Days sales outstanding (DSO) is the average number of days it takes a company to receive payment for a sale.
A high DSO number suggests that a company is experiencing delays in receiving payments, which can result in a cash flow problem.
A low DSO indicates that the company is getting its payments quickly. That money can be put back into the business to good effect.
Generally speaking, a DSO under 45 days is considered low.
Investopedia / Tara Anand
Understanding Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
Given the vital importance of cash flow in running a business, it is in a company's best interest to collect its outstanding
accounts receivables
as quickly as possible. Companies can expect, with relative certainty, that they will be paid their outstanding receivables. But because of the
time value of money
principle, time spent waiting to be paid is money lost.
That said, the definition of ""quickly"" depends on the business. In the financial industry, relatively long payment terms are common. In the agriculture and fuel industries, fast payment can be crucial. In general, small businesses rely more heavily on steady cash flow than large, diversified companies.

Tip
By quickly turning sales into cash, a company has a chance to put the cash to use again more quickly.
What the Numbers Tell You
A high DSO number shows that a company is selling its product to customers on credit and waiting a long time to collect the money. This can lead to cash flow problems. A low DSO value means that it takes a company fewer days to collect its accounts receivable. That company is promptly getting the money it needs to create new business.
In effect, determining the average length of time that a company’s outstanding balances are carried in receivables can reveal a great deal about the nature of the company’s cash flow.
It is important to remember that the formula for calculating DSO only accounts for credit sales. While cash sales may be considered to have a DSO of 0, they are not factored into DSO calculations. If they were factored into the calculation, they would decrease the DSO, and companies with a high proportion of cash sales would have lower DSOs than those with a high proportion of credit sales.
Applications of Days Sales Outstanding
Days sales outstanding can be analyzed in a wide variety of ways. It suggests how efficient the company's collections department is, and the degree to which the company is maintaining customer satisfaction. It also helps identify customers who are not creditworthy.
Looking at a DSO value for a company for a single period can provide a good benchmark for quickly assessing a company’s cash flow. However, trends in DSO over time are much more useful. They can act as an early warning sign of trouble.
Good and Bad DSO Numbers
If a company’s DSO is increasing, it's a warning sign that something is wrong. Customer satisfaction might be declining, or the salespeople may be offering longer terms of payment to drive increased sales. Perhaps the company may be allowing customers with poor credit to make purchases on credit.
A sharp increase in DSO can cause a company serious cash flow problems. If a company's ability to make its own payments in a timely fashion is disrupted, it may be forced to make drastic changes.
37.30
Average DSO for companies across various industries in the third quarter of 2022.

Generally, when looking at a given company’s cash flow, it is helpful to track that company’s DSO over time to determine if its DSO is trending up or down or if there are patterns in the company’s cash flow history.
DSO may vary consistently on a monthly basis, particularly if the company's product is seasonal. If a company has a volatile DSO, this may be cause for concern, but if its DSO regularly dips during a particular season each year, it could be no reason to worry.
Limitations of Days Sales Outstanding
As a metric attempting to gauge the efficiency of a business, days sales outstanding comes with a limitation that is important for any investor to consider.
When using DSO to compare the cash flows of a number of companies, you should compare companies within the same industry, with similar
business models
and revenue numbers. If you try to compare companies in different industries and of different sizes, the results you'll get will be misleading because they often have very different DSO benchmarks and targets.
When DSO Is Not As Relevant
DSO is not particularly useful in comparing companies with significant differences in the proportion of sales that are made on credit. The DSO of a company with a low proportion of credit sales does not indicate much about that company’s cash flow. Comparing such companies with those that have a high proportion of credit sales also says little.
In addition, DSO is not a perfect indicator of a company’s accounts receivable efficiency. Fluctuating sales volumes can affect DSO, with any increase in sales lowering the DSO value.
Delinquent Days Sales Outstanding (DDSO) is a good alternative for credit collection assessment or for use alongside DSO. Like any metric measuring a company’s performance, DSO should not be considered alone, but rather should be used with other metrics.
How Do You Calculate DSO?
Divide the total number of accounts receivable during a given period by the total dollar value of credit sales during the same period, then multiply the result by the number of days in the period being measured.
What Is a Good DSO Ratio?
A good or bad DSO ratio may vary according to the type of business and industry that the company operates in. That said, a number under 45 is considered to be good for most businesses.
3
It suggests that the company's cash is flowing in at a reasonably efficient rate, ready to be used to generate new business.
How Do You Calculate DSO for 3 Months?
During the last three months of the year, Company A made a total of $1,500,000 in credit sales and had $1,050,000 in accounts receivable. The time period covers 92 days. Company A’s DSO for that period is calculated as follows:
1,050,000 divided by 1,500,000 equals 0.7.
0.7 multiplied by 92 equals 64.4.
The DSO for this business in this period is 64.4.
Why Is DSO Important?
A high DSO number can indicate that the cash flow of the business is not ideal. It varies by business, but a number below 45 is considered good. It's best to track the number over time. If the number is climbing, there may be something wrong in the collections department, or the company may be selling to customers with less than optimal credit. In any case, the company's cash flow is at risk.
The debt collections experts at Atradius suggest that tracking DSO over time also creates an incentive for the payments department to stay on top of unpaid invoices.
1
Needless to say, a small business can use its days sales outstanding number to identify and flag customers that are weighing it down by not paying promptly.
The Bottom Line
In many businesses, the days sales outstanding number can be a valuable indicator of the efficiency of the business and the quality of its cash flow. If the number gets too high, it could even disrupt the normal operations of the business, causing its own outstanding payments to be delayed. In any case, cash delayed is cash lost to your business.

What Is the Nasdaq?
Nasdaq is a global electronic marketplace for buying and selling securities. Its name was originally an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. Nasdaq started as a subsidiary of the
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)
, now known as the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
.
Nasdaq was launched after the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
urged NASD to automate the market for securities not listed on an exchange. The result was the first electronic trading system. Nasdaq opened for business in 1971.

Key Takeaways
Nasdaq is an online global marketplace for buying and trading securities—the world's first electronic exchange.
It operates 29 markets, one clearinghouse, and five central securities depositories in the United States and Europe.
Most of the world's technology giants are listed on the Nasdaq.

Understanding the Nasdaq
As noted above, the Nasdaq is a stock exchange headquartered in New York. It began as a
subsidiary
of the NASD and officially opened for business on Feb. 8, 1971. It was the world's first automated stock exchange.
1
Nasdaq officially separated from the NASD and began to operate as a national securities exchange in 2006. In 2008, it combined with the Scandinavian exchanges group OMX to become the Nasdaq OMX Group.
2
The company changed its name to Nasdaq Inc. in 2015.
3
There are more than 5,000 companies that are listed and traded on the exchange on a daily basis. Many of these companies are major technology companies, such as Apple (
AAPL
) and Microsoft (
MSFT
).

The exchange operates 29 markets enabling the trading of stocks, derivatives, fixed income, and
commodities
in the U.S., Canada, Scandinavia, and the Baltics. The company also runs a
clearinghouse
and five central securities depositories in the United States and Europe.

Its trading technology is used by 100 exchanges in 50 countries.
Nasdaq Composite
The term Nasdaq is also used to refer to the
Nasdaq Composite

6
The Nasdaq Composite closed at a record high of 16,057.44 on Nov. 19, 2021. The index proceeded to drop more than 23% from that point through April 2022.
7
The Nasdaq Composite's 13.3% decline in April 2022 was its worst monthly drop since October 2008, when the index lost 17.4% amid the global financial crisis. It closed at 13,787.92 on June 30, 2023.
8
Important
Nasdaq Inc. is listed on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol
NDAQ
and has been part of the S&P 500 Index since 2008.
Nasdaq Trading System
The Nasdaq computerized trading system was initially devised as an
alternative to the inefficient specialist system
, which was the prevalent model for almost a century. The rapid evolution of technology has made Nasdaq’s electronic trading model the standard for markets worldwide.
It was only fitting for the world’s up-and-coming technology companies to list on an exchange using the latest technology. As the tech sector grew in prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, the Nasdaq Composite Index became its most widely quoted proxy.
That turned Nasdaq Composite into the index of the
dot-com boom
and bust. After rallying nearly 150% in the 16 months through March 2000, the Nasdaq Composite then slumped almost 80% by October 2002.
History of the Nasdaq
In November 2016,
chief operating officer (COO)
Adena Friedman was promoted to the role of
chief executive officer (CEO)
, becoming the first woman to run a major exchange in the United States.
9
Board Diversity Disclosure Rule
On Dec. 1, 2020, Nasdaq proposed a new rule requiring companies listed on the exchange to report on the diversity of their board of directors. The rule requires companies to include on their boards at least one female director and one who is a member of an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+, or to publicly explain why they have not done so. The SEC approved the board diversity disclosure rule on Aug. 6, 2021.

What Is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)?
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in December 1970 by the executive order of President Richard Nixon. It is an agency of the United States federal government whose mission is to protect human and environmental health. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the EPA is responsible for creating standards and laws promoting the health of individuals and the environment.
Key Takeaways
The Environmental Protection Agency is a United States federal government agency whose mission is to protect human and environmental health.
The EPA regulates the manufacturing, processing, distribution, and use of chemicals and other pollutants.
The agency enforces its findings through fines, sanctions, and other procedures.
It oversees programs to promote energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, sustainable growth, air and water quality, and pollution prevention.
Some of the areas that aren’t covered by the EPA include wildlife, wetlands, food safety, and nuclear waste.
Understanding the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Why was the EPA created? It was formed in response to widespread public environmental concerns that gained momentum in the 1950s and 1960s. From the EPA’s creation, it has sought to protect and conserve the natural environment and improve the health of humans by researching the effects of and mandating limits on the use of pollutants.
The EPA regulates the
manufacturing
, processing,
distribution
, and use of chemicals and other pollutants. Also, the EPA is charged with determining safe tolerance levels for chemicals and other pollutants in food, animal feed, and water.
The EPA enforces its findings through fines,
sanctions
, and other procedures. Under the Trump administration, the EPA’s regulations of carbon emissions from power plants, automobiles, and other contributors to climate change, instituted by President Obama, were significantly
rolled back
. The EPA’s size and influence have also been diminished, and criminal prosecutions for those who aren’t following regulations are at a 30-year low.
The EPA is led by the EPA administrator, a cabinet-level post nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. That position is currently held by
Michael Regan
, the first Black man to ever hold that position. He is expected to reverse many of the regulatory rollbacks of the Trump administration.

Examples of EPA Programs
The EPA oversees several programs intended to promote energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, sustainable growth, air and water quality, and pollution prevention. These programs include:
The EPA Safer Choice program
—formerly Design for the Environment—a product-labeling program that allows consumers to select the chemically safest products available, without sacrificing function or quality
The Energy Star program
, which helps consumers choose energy-efficient appliances
The Smart Growth program
, which supports sustainable community development
WaterSense
, which encourages efficiency in water use via high-efficiency toilets, faucets, and irrigation equipment
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
, which regulates the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters
Important
The EPA protects human health and the environment with programs such as Safer Choice and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
The EPA also runs programs to
Prevent, control, and respond to oil spills
Control air pollution and forecast air pollution levels
Foster the manufacturing of more fuel-efficient vehicles
How the EPA Enforces Laws
To protect communities and the environment, the EPA works to enforce laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the National Environmental Education Act, and the Clean Water Act, some of which predate the formation of the agency itself.
The EPA is also responsible for the detection and prevention of environmental crimes, monitoring pollution levels, and setting standards for the handling of hazardous chemicals and waste. As part of its strategic plan, when violations occur, the EPA investigates and pursues action against violators.
Environmental offenses are categorized as civil or criminal. Civil offenses arise when environmental violations occur and no consideration is given to whether the offender knew of their transgression.
1
﻿ Criminal offenses, which comprise most of what the EPA investigates, arise when a violation occurs and the offender knew that their action caused it. Because of the severity of charges and punishment, criminal convictions require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Violators can be held civilly and/or criminally responsible, with punishments for civil offenses ranging from monetary fines to repairing environmental damage and punishments for criminal offenses ranging from monetary relief to imprisonment.
$83.4 million
The largest civil penalty assessed for violating environmental law.
2
﻿
For civil violations, the EPA may enforce actions by issuing orders or seeking court rulings. Criminal violations are enforced by the EPA or the governing state, with punishments imposed by a judge.
Examples of What the EPA Doesn’t Do
Because of its name, there tends to be some confusion about what
the EPA does and doesn’t do
. It doesn’t handle every issue or concern that affects the environment. The agency suggests contacting local, state, or other federal agencies to find out who is responsible.
For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for the Endangered Species Act, while local and state wildlife officers are responsible for concerns about foxes, birds, rabbits, and other animals. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the agency that determines and issues permits for wetland areas. Food safety is the responsibility of the
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), while issues about nuclear waste are handled by the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management.
Criticism of the EPA
Not everyone supports the EPA. Some critics argue that the EPA's environmental regulations are too expensive and offer little benefits. Others claim that the EPA stifles the economy, contributes to unemployment rates, and adversely affects international trade.
These opponents believe that the associated costs for companies to remain in compliance with environmental laws and standards erode profits and cause widespread layoffs, contributing to unemployment. These absorbent costs also prevent companies from being competitive globally. They suggest that the costs are inflated and that those earmarked funds could be used for more productive ways to advance the economy and trade.
Some proponents for environmental regulation disfavor the EPA for not acting swiftly on matters that concern the environment. For example, in 2020, Congress and environmentalists criticized the EPA for moving slowly on limiting the use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances—toxic chemicals found to cause cancer, infertility, and other diseases.
3
﻿ Research shows that these toxins are contaminating the nation's drinking water and have been found in lifesaving equipment and household items. These critics claim that, in light of the research, the EPA is not doing enough or moving fast enough to protect public health.
The EPA responded with action plans to address how communities monitor and address PFAS contamination. However, critics argue that their plan lacks action and, as a result, is detrimental to the environment and the nation's citizens.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) FAQs
What Is the EPA and Why Was It Created?

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) creates and enforces laws designed to protect the environment and human health.
4
As part of their mission, they seek to ensure that Americans have a clean environment, including the air, water, and land they use and enjoy. In addition to creating and enforcing environmental laws, they provide education and guidance on protecting the environment, conduct research and development, issue grants to state programs, schools, and other non-profit organizations to further their mission, and more.
How Do I Get in Touch With the EPA?
You can contact the EPA online, by phone, or in writing. How to contact them depends on the nature of your concern or question. For more information, visit their website,
epa.gov
.
What Is an EPA Violation?
EPA violations consist of intentional and nonintentional violations of environmental laws. Common examples include illegal disposal of hazardous chemicals or products, illegal discharge of pollutants in bodies of water in the U.S., and tampering with water supplies.
5
﻿
The Bottom Line
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a federal government agency, created by the Nixon Administration, to protect human health and the environment. The EPA creates and enforces environmental laws, inspects the environment, and provides technical support to minimize threats and support recovery planning.
It consists of different programs—such as The Energy Star program, The Smart Growth Program, and Water Sense—that promote energy efficiency, environmental care, and pollution prevention. Not all concerns with the environment are handled by the EPA, however. For example, protecting endangered species falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and protecting our nation's wetlands is under the authority of the U.S",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-protection-agency.asp

What Is a 501(c)(3) Organization?
Section 501(c)(3) is a portion of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
and a specific tax category for
nonprofit organizations
. Organizations that meet Section 501(c)(3) requirements are exempt from federal income tax. The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
recognizes more than 30 types of nonprofit organizations but only those that qualify for 501(c)(3) status can say that donations made to them are
tax-deductible
.
1
Most of the organizations that may be eligible for 501(c)(3) status fall into one of three categories: charitable organizations, religious organizations, and private foundations.
2
Key Takeaways
501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations are tax-exempt.
Donations to 501(c)(3) nonprofits are tax-deductible.
To receive its favorable tax treatment, the nonprofit must not deviate from its purpose or mission.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
How a 501(c)(3) Organization Works
To qualify for
tax-exempt
status, a group must exist for one of these purposes: charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, preventing cruelty to children or animals, or fostering national or international amateur sports competition.
3
3
A 501(c)(3) nonprofit must remain true to its founding purpose to stay tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3). If the nonprofit decides to pursue a new mission, the organization must notify the IRS of the change. Failing to do so would result in the loss of its tax-exempt status.
4
In addition, an organization must not serve any private interests. These include the interests of the creator, the creator’s family, shareholders of the organization, and other designated individuals. None of the net earnings of the organization can be used to benefit any private shareholder or individual. All earnings must be used solely for the advancement of the organization's mission.
5
Some unrelated
business income
is allowed for a 501(c)(3) organization. However, the amount cannot be substantial. The majority of the nonprofits’s efforts must go toward its mission. Any unrelated business from sales of merchandise or rental properties must be limited, or the organization could lose its 501(c)(3) status.
6
Fast Fact
The IRS doesn’t specify exactly how much is too much unrelated business income, but the law firm of Hurwit & Associates, which specializes in representing nonprofits, estimates the amount at somewhere between 15% and 30%.
7
A 501(c)(3) organization cannot use its activities to influence legislation in a substantial way, including participating in any campaign activities to support or deny any particular political candidate. A 501(c)(3) nonprofit is typically cannot engage in
lobbying
except in instances when its expenditures are below a certain amount.
8
9
Organizations that meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) are exempt from federal income tax but they're required to
withhold federal income tax
from their employees’ paychecks as well as withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes.
10
People employed by the organization must be paid “reasonable compensation,” which is based on the
fair market value
that the job function requires.
11
Important
Once granted 501(c)(3) status, the 501(c)(3) designation remains for as long as the organization exists, unless it is revoked by the IRS.
12
Special Considerations
Organizations that meet the 501(c)(3) tax category requirements can be classified into two categories: public charities and
private foundations
. The
primary distinction
between these two categories is in how they get their financial support.
13
Public Charities
A public charity is a nonprofit organization that receives a substantial portion of its income or revenue from the general public or the government. At least one-third of its income must be received from donations from the general public, including individuals, corporations, and other nonprofit organizations.
14
Individuals who donate to an organization that the IRS considers to be a public charity may qualify for certain tax deductions that can help them lower their taxable income. The total amount of donations to a tax-exempt public charity that an individual can claim is generally limited to 60% of their
adjusted gross income (AGI)
as of 2025.
15
Private Foundations
A
private foundation
is typically held by an individual, a family, or a corporation. It typically receives most of its income from a small group of donors.
All 501(c)(3) organizations are automatically classified as private foundations unless they can prove that they meet the IRS standards to be considered a public charity.
16
The deductibility of contributions to a private foundation is more limited than donations made to a public charity.
15
Most nonprofit organizations are required to file Form 1023 or Form 1023-EZ within 27 months from their date of incorporation to apply for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3).
17
The charitable organization must include its
articles of incorporation
and provide documents that prove that the organization's mission qualifies it for tax-exempt status.
13
However, not all organizations that qualify for the tax category must submit Form 1023. Public charities that earn less than $5,000 in revenue per year are exempt from filing this form. But they may still choose to file the form even though it's not required so they can ensure that donations made to their organization will be tax deductible for donors.
18
Strengths and Challenges of 501(c)(3) Organizations
The 501(c)(3) status offers myriad benefits to the designated organizations and the people they serve. These organizations are exempt from paying federal income and unemployment taxes and patrons who donate to them are allowed to claim a tax deduction for their contributions.
These organizations are eligible to receive government and private grants to help with funding and to further their mission. These organizations also often receive discounts from retailers, free advertising by way of public service announcements, and food and supplies from other nonprofit organizations designed to help in times of need.
A 501(c)(3) organization must operate within the confines of the law pertaining to 501(c)(3) organizations to maintain its favorable tax treatment.
Because the organization serves the public, it must operate with full transparency. Its finances, including salaries, are available to members of the public.
19
Pros
Exempt from federal taxes
Contributions are tax-deductible
Eligible for governmental funding and private grants
Cons
Does not belong to those who created it
Restricted to specific operations to receive tax exemptions
Financial information is publicly accessible
Example of a 501(c)(3) Organization
The American Red Cross, established in 1881 and congressionally chartered in 1900, is one of the United States’ oldest nonprofit organizations.
20
Its mission statement states that the organization “prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.” Since its inception, its goal has been to serve members of the armed forces and provide aid during disasters.
21
The Red Cross is located in 192 countries and operates the largest network of volunteers in the world. This 501(c)(3) organization is segmented into three divisions: the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
22
The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies include the American Red Cross. They aim to relieve human suffering globally by empowering subordinate organizations to operate within their nation’s borders to provide disaster relief, education, and other related services.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provides global humanitarian aid during peacetime, such as assisting refugees. The International Committee of the Red Cross provides humanitarian relief for people who are affected by war or other armed conflicts.
22
Individuals who itemize their tax deductions can contribute to the Red Cross and claim the amount donated as a deduction.

What Is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?
The compound annual growth rate is the
rate of return
that an investment would need to have every year in order to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, over a given time interval. The CAGR assumes that any profits were reinvested at the end of each period of the investment’s life span.
Key Takeaways
The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time.
It measures a smoothed rate of return.
Investors can compare the CAGR of two or more alternatives to evaluate how well one stock performed against other stocks in a peer group or a market index.
CAGR is thus a good way to evaluate how different investments have performed over time, or against a benchmark.
The CAGR does not, however, reflect investment risk.

To calculate the CAGR of an investment:
Divide the value of an investment at the end of the period by its value at the beginning of that period.
Raise the result to an exponent of one divided by the number of years.
Subtract one from the subsequent result.
Multiply by 100 to convert the answer into a percentage.
The CAGR formula gives an annualized rate of return, which is useful for comparing the performance of different investments over time.
What the CAGR Can Tell You
The compound annual growth rate isn’t a true return rate, but rather a representational figure. It is essentially a number that describes the rate at which an investment would have grown if it had grown at the same rate every year and the profits were reinvested at the end of each year. For stock market investors, this can be particularly useful in comparing the performance of different stocks. The CAGR does not take into account the discount rate, which is critical in assessing the present value of future returns.
In reality, this sort of performance is unlikely. However, the CAGR can be used to smooth returns so that they may be more easily understood and compared to alternative methods.

Example of How to Use CAGR
Imagine you invested $10,000 in a portfolio with the returns outlined below:
From Jan. 1, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2019, your portfolio grew to $13,000 (or 30% in year one).
On Jan. 1, 2020, the portfolio was $14,000 (or 7.69% from January 2019 to January 2020).
On Jan. 1, 2021, the portfolio ended with $19,000 (or 35.71% from January 2020 to January 2021).
We can see that on an annual basis, the year-to-year growth rates of the investment portfolio were quite different as shown in the parentheses.
On the other hand, the compound annual growth rate smooths the investment’s performance and ignores the fact that 2018 and 2020 were vastly different from 2019. The CAGR over that period was 23.86% and can be calculated as follows:

The CAGR of 23.86% over the three-year investment period can help an investor compare alternatives for their capital or make forecasts of future values. For example, imagine an investor is comparing the performance of two uncorrelated investments.
In any given year during the period, one investment may be rising while the other falls. This could be the case when comparing high-yield
bonds
to
stocks
, or a real estate investment to emerging markets. Using CAGR would smooth the annual return over the period so the two alternatives would be easier to compare.
As another example, let’s say an investor bought 55 shares of Amazon.com (
AMZN
) stock in December 2017 at $1,180 per share, for a total investment of $64,900. After three years, in December 2020, the stock has risen to $3,200 per share, and the investor’s investment is now worth $176,000.
1
What is the CAGR?
Using the CAGR formula, we know that we need the:
Ending Balance: $176,000
Beginning Balance: $64,900
Number of Years: 3
So to calculate the CAGR for this simple example, we would enter that data into the formula as follows: [($176,000 / $64,900) ^ (1/3)] - 1 = 39.5%.
Additional CAGR Uses
The CAGR can be used to calculate the average growth of a single investment. As we saw in our example above, due to market
volatility
, the year-to-year growth of an investment will likely appear erratic and uneven.
For example, an investment may increase in value by 8% in one year, decrease in value by -2% the following year, and increase in value by 5% in the next. CAGR helps smooth returns when growth rates are expected to be volatile and inconsistent.
Comparing Investments
The CAGR produces a
geometric mean
which can be used to compare different investment types with one another. For example, suppose that in 2015, an investor placed $10,000 into an account for five years with a fixed annual
interest rate
of 1% and another $10,000 into a stock
mutual fund
. The rate of return in the stock fund will be uneven over the next few years, so a comparison between the two investments would be difficult.
Assume that at the end of the five-year period, the savings account’s balance is $10,510.10 and, although the other investment has grown unevenly, the ending balance in the stock fund was $15,348.52. Using the CAGR to compare the two investments can help an investor understand the difference in returns:

On the surface, the stock fund may look like a better investment, with nearly nine times the return of the savings account. On the other hand, one of the drawbacks of the CAGR is that by smoothing the returns, the CAGR cannot tell an investor how volatile or risky the stock fund was. However, the CAGR can be used in the
MAR ratio
, which adjusts for risk. Using the CAGR alongside metrics like net present value (NPV) provides a more comprehensive view of an investment’s potential.
Track Performance
The CAGR can also be used to track the performance of various business measures of one or multiple companies alongside one another. For example, over a five-year period, Big-Sale Stores’ market share CAGR was 1.82%, but its customer satisfaction CAGR over the same period was -0.58%. In this way, comparing the CAGRs of measures within a company reveals strengths and weaknesses.
Detect Weaknesses and Strengths
Comparing the CAGRs of business activities across similar companies will help evaluate competitive weaknesses and strengths. For example, Big-Sale’s customer satisfaction CAGR might not seem so low compared with SuperFast Cable’s customer satisfaction CAGR of -6.31% during the same period.
How Investors Use the CAGR
Understanding the formula used to calculate CAGR is an introduction to many other ways that investors evaluate past returns or estimate future profits. The formula can be manipulated algebraically into a formula to find the present value or future value of money, or to calculate a
hurdle rate
of return.
For example, imagine that an investor knows that they need $50,000 for a child’s college education in 18 years and they have $15,000 to invest today. How much does the average rate of return need to be to reach that",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp

What Is a J-Curve?
A J-curve is a trendline that shows an initial loss immediately followed by a dramatic gain. In a chart, this pattern of activity would follow the shape of a capital ""J"".
The J-curve effect is often cited in economics to illustrate the way that a country’s
balance of trade
initially worsens following a devaluation of its currency, then quickly recovers and finally surpasses its previous performance.
J-curves are observed in other fields including medicine and political science. In each case, an initial loss is followed by a significant gain to a level that exceeds the starting point.
Key Takeaways
A J-curve depicts a trend that starts with a sharp drop and is followed by a dramatic rise.
The trendline ends in an improvement from the starting point.
In economics, the J-curve shows how a currency depreciation causes a severe worsening of a trade imbalance followed by a substantial improvement.
In private equity investing, it is seen as an inevitable consequence of a company turnaround: a period of increased losses followed by an upward swing as the turnaround takes hold.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding the J-Curve
The J-curve is useful to demonstrate the effects of an event or action over a set period of time. Put bluntly, it shows that things are going to get worse before they get better.
In economics, it is often used to observe the effects of a weaker currency on trade balances. The pattern is as follows:
Immediately after a nation's currency is devalued, imports get more expensive and exports get cheaper, creating a worsening
trade deficit
(or at least a smaller trade surplus).
Shortly thereafter, the sales volume of the nation's exports begins to rise steadily, thanks to their relatively cheap prices in foreign markets.
At the same time, consumers at home begin to buy more locally-produced goods because they have become relatively affordable compared to imports.
Over time, the trade balance between the nation and its partners bounces back and even exceeds pre-devaluation times.
The devaluation of the nation's currency had an immediate negative effect because of an inevitable lag in satisfying greater demand for the country's products.
When a
country’s currency appreciates
, economists note, a reverse J-curve may occur. The country’s exports abruptly become more expensive for importing countries. If exports from other countries can fill the demand for a lower price, the stronger currency will reduce its export competitiveness. Local consumers may switch to imports, too, because they have become more competitive with locally produced goods.
The J-Curve in Private Equity
The term J-curve is used to describe the typical trajectory of investments made by a private equity firm.
Important
The J-curve is a visual representation of the plain fact that sometimes things get worse before they get better.
Private equity firms have a different path to profitability than public companies or the funds that invest in them.
Their portfolios, by design, are made up of companies that were performing poorly when they were purchased. The firm then spends substantial amounts of money retooling the company's operations before spinning it off as a renewed company.
That means an initial decline in performance followed, at least theoretically, by a steep improvement in performance.
What Is a Reverse J-Curve?
To an economist, a reverse J-curve may occur when a currency gains in value against the values of the currencies of its competitors. That is, a short spurt of growth is followed by an sharp downward trend. The cause, as in a normal J-curve trend, is the lag between the change in currency value and its full impact on consumer behavior. It takes time for suppliers and consumers to switch to cheaper choices and for competitors to take advantage of the new opportunity.
What Is an Example of a J-Curve in Medicine?
One highly-debated example of a J-curve in medicine is in research that suggests that there is a J-curve effect in the treatment of blood pressure. It maintains that blood pressure should be reduced only to a ""normal"" point, below which it reaches a level that could be dangerous to the patient. This unresolved issue has major implications for the medical community given the clear dangers posed by high blood pressure.
1
Is There a J-Curve Effect in Investing?
In investing, the J-curve is cited as the usual trajectory of a private equity investment. These deep-pocketed investors are willing to put up with initial losses while spending substantial amounts of money to return an ailing company to profitability.
The J-curve, if successful, is expected to emerge in five to eight years from the purchase of the company.
2
The Bottom Line
The J-curve effect is most often used in economics, to describe the effects of a currency devaluation, and in private equity, to describe the trajectory of a long-term investment.
It could be relevant in many other instances when used to illustrate an outcome that starts with a negative impact but is quickly followed by a sharply positive impact.

What Is Mercantilism?
Mercantilism was an economic system of trade that spanned the 16th century to the 18th century. Mercantilism was based on the principle that the world's wealth was static, and consequently, governments had to regulate trade to build their wealth and national power. Many European nations attempted to accumulate the largest possible share of that wealth by maximizing their exports and limiting their imports via
tariffs
.
1
Key Takeaways
Mercantilism was the dominant economic system from the 16th century to the 18th century.
Mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation's wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and reducing imports.
It's characterized by the belief that global wealth was static and that a nation's economic health relied heavily on its supply of capital.
Due to the nationalistic nature of mercantilism, nations frequently used military might to protect local markets and supply sources.
Mercantilism was replaced by free-trade economic theory in the mid-18th century.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
Understanding Mercantilism
Mercantilism was a form of economic nationalism that sought to increase the prosperity and power of a nation through restrictive trade practices. Its goal was to increase the supply of a state's
gold
and
silver
with exports rather than to deplete it through imports.
1
It also sought to support domestic employment.
Mercantilism centered on the interests of merchants and producers (such as England's East India Company and the Dutch East India Company) and protected their activities as necessary.
2
3
Mercantilism had several noteworthy characteristics.
1. The Belief in the Static Nature of Wealth

Financial wealth was considered limited (due to the rarity of precious metals). Nations that sought prosperity and power needed to secure as much wealth as possible, at the expense of other nations.
2. The Need to Increase the Supply of Gold
Gold represented wealth and power. It could pay for soldiers, seafaring exploration for natural resources, and expanding empires. It could also protect against invasion. A lack of gold meant the downfall of a nation.
3. The Need to Maintain a Trade Surplus
This was integral to building wealth. Nations needed to focus on selling their exports (and collecting the associated revenue) more than on spending on imports (and sending gold out of countries).
4. The Importance of a Large Population
Large populations represented wealth. Increasing a nation's population was integral to supplying a labor force, supporting domestic commerce, and maintaining armies.
5. The Use of Colonies to Support Wealth
Some nations needed colonies for raw materials, a labor supply, and a way to keep wealth within its control (by selling colonies the products their raw materials helped to produce). Essentially, colonies increased a nation's wealth-building power and national security.
6. The Use of Protectionism
Protecting a nation's ability to build and maintain trade surpluses encompassed prohibiting colonies from trading with other nations and imposing tariffs on imported goods.
History of Mercantilism
First seen in Europe during the 1500s, mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation's wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and limiting imports.
Mercantilism replaced the feudal economic system in Western Europe.
4
At the time, England was the epicenter of the British Empire but had relatively few natural resources.
To grow its wealth, England introduced
fiscal policies
that discouraged colonists from buying foreign products and created incentives to buy only British goods. For example, the Sugar Act of 1764 raised duties on foreign refined sugar and molasses imported by the colonies. This increased taxation was meant to give British sugar growers in the West Indies a monopoly on the colonial market.
5
Similarly, the Navigation Act of 1651 forbade foreign vessels from trading along the British coast and required colonial exports to first pass through British control before being redistributed throughout Europe.
6
Programs like these resulted in a favorable
balance of trade
that increased Great Britain's national wealth.
Under mercantilism, nations frequently engaged their military might to ensure that local markets and supply sources were protected. Mercantilists also believed that a nation's economic health could be measured by its ownership of precious metals, such as gold or silver. Their levels tended to rise with increased new home construction, increased agricultural output, and a strong merchant fleet that serviced additional markets with goods and raw materials.
French Mercantilism
Arguably the most influential proponent of mercantilism, French Controller General of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683) studied foreign-trade economic theories. He was uniquely positioned to execute on mercantilist ideas.
7
A devout monarchist, Colbert called for an economic strategy that protected the French crown from a rising Dutch mercantile class.
8
Colbert also increased the size of the French navy, on the belief that France had to control its trade routes to increase its wealth.
9
Although his practices ultimately proved unsuccessful, his ideas were hugely popular. Ultimately, they became overshadowed by the theory of free-market economics.
British Colonial Mercantilism
The British colonies were subject to the direct and indirect effects of mercantilist policy at home. Here are several examples:
Controlled production and trade
: Mercantilism led to the adoption of far-reaching
trade restrictions
, which stunted the growth and freedom of colonial businesses.
The expansion of the slave trade
: Trade became triangulated between the British Empire, its colonies, and foreign markets. This fostered the development of the slave trade in many colonies, including America. The colonies provided rum, cotton, and other products demanded by African imperialists. In turn, slaves were returned to America or the West Indies and traded for sugar and molasses.
10
Inflation and taxation
: The British government demanded that trading be conducted using gold and silver bullion, ever seeking a positive balance of trade. The colonies often had insufficient bullion left over to circulate in their own markets, so they issued
paper currency

Mismanagement of printed currency resulted in inflationary periods. Additionally, since Great Britain was in a near-constant state of war, heavy taxation was needed to prop up its army and navy. The combination of taxes and inflation caused
great colonial discontent
.
Colonial American Mercantilism
Defenders of mercantilism argued that it created stronger economies by marrying the concerns of colonies with those of their founding countries. In theory, when British colonists created their own products and obtained others by trading with their founding nation, they remained independent from the influence of hostile nations.
Meanwhile, Great Britain benefited from receiving large amounts of raw material from the colonists that was necessary for a productive manufacturing sector.
Critics of mercantilism believed the restriction on
international trade
increased expenses, because all imports, regardless of product origin, had to be shipped by British ships. This radically spiked the costs of goods for the colonists, who believed the disadvantages of this system outweighed the benefits of affiliating with Great Britain.
After a costly war with France, the British Empire, hungry to replenish revenue, raised taxes on colonists, who rebelled by boycotting British products, consequently slashing imports by a full one-third. This was followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, where Boston colonists disguised as Indians raided three British ships. They emptied several hundred chests of tea into the harbor to protest British taxes on tea and the monopoly granted to the East India Company. To reinforce its mercantilist control, Great Britain pushed harder against the colonies. This resulted in the Revolutionary War.

Merchants and Mercantilism
By the early 16th century, European financial theorists understood the importance of the merchant class in generating wealth. Cities and countries with goods to sell thrived in the late middle ages.

Definition
Indemnity insurance is a type of policy that compensates professionals and business owners for certain unexpected damages or losses, typically covering legal costs and settlements when they are found at fault for a specific event.
What Is Indemnity Insurance?
The term indemnity insurance refers to an
insurance
policy that compensates an insured party for certain unexpected damages or losses up to a certain limit—usually the amount of the loss itself. Insurance companies provide coverage in exchange for
premiums
paid by the insured parties.
These policies are commonly designed to protect professionals and business owners when they are found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment or malpractice. They generally take the form of a
letter of indemnity
.
Key Takeaways
Indemnity insurance is a type of insurance policy where the insurance company guarantees compensation for losses or damages sustained by a policyholder.
Indemnity insurance is designed to protect professionals and business owners when found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment.
Certain professionals must carry indemnity insurance including those involved in financial and legal services, such as financial advisors, insurance agents, accountants, mortgage brokers, and attorneys.
Medical malpractice, professional liability, and errors and omissions insurance are examples of indemnity insurance.
Investopedia / NoNo Flores
How Indemnity Insurance Works
Indemnity
is a comprehensive form of insurance compensation for damages or loss. In a legal sense, it may also refer to an
exemption
from
liability
for damages. The insurer promises to make the insured party whole again for any covered loss in exchange for premiums the policyholder pays.
Indemnity insurance is a supplemental form of
liability insurance
specific to certain professionals or service providers. Insurance professionals provide counsel, expertise, or specialized services. Also referred to as
professional liability insurance
, indemnity insurance is nothing like general liability or other forms of commercial liability insurance that protect businesses against claims of bodily harm or property damage.
Indemnity insurance protects against
claims
arising from possible negligence or failure to perform that result in a client’s financial loss or legal entanglement. A client who suffers a loss can file a civil claim. In response, the professional’s indemnity insurance will pay litigation costs as well as any damages awarded by the court.
As with any other form of insurance, indemnity insurance covers the costs of an indemnity claim including but not limited to court costs,
fees
, and settlements. The amount covered by insurance depends on the specific agreement, and the cost of the insurance depends on many factors including the history of indemnity claims.
Typical examples of indemnity insurance include professional insurance policies like
malpractice insurance
and errors and omissions insurance (E&O). These special insurance policies indemnify or reimburse professionals against claims made as they conduct their business.
Special Considerations
Certain professionals are strongly advised to carry indemnity insurance. These professionals include those involved in financial and legal services, such as
financial advisors
, insurance agents, accountants,
mortgage brokers
, and attorneys. When dispensing financial or legal advice, these professionals are potentially liable for negligence or inadequate performance despite the intent of goodwill.
In the financial industry, a professional who provides financial advice that results in the purchase of an insurance or investment product can purchase
errors and omissions insurance
, to protect themselves, if the advice given causes damages. For example, accountants may be found negligent for advising a client on tax matters that in turn result in a penalty or additional taxes.
Important
Indemnity insurance also covers court costs, fees, and settlements in addition to an indemnity claim.
In the medical field,
malpractice insurance
is a form of professional indemnity insurance. Malpractice insurance protects medical practitioners from civil claims arising from negligence that results in physical or mental harm to patients. Medical malpractice insurance is required in some states, but optional in most.
Many executives purchase indemnity insurance to protect their deferred compensation plans against company claims or
bankruptcy
. Other professions, such as contractors, consultants, and maintenance professionals, carry indemnity insurance as a practical matter due to their exposure to failure to perform claims.
Professional indemnity insurance provides a critical layer of protection for service providers. Often these professionals might also need other forms of liability coverage such as general liability insurance or product liability coverage. Those purchasing indemnity policies can also add
endorsements
. An endorsement is an add-on that expands or enhances the coverage in some way.
Indemnity Insurance vs. Life Insurance
Both indemnity and life insurance policies provide coverage for losses to an insured party in exchange for premiums up to a certain limit.
Life insurance
, though, provides a
lump-sum
payout to the named
beneficiaries
when an insured party dies. Unlike indemnity insurance, the payout, referred to as a
death benefit
, is the full amount of the policy—not for the amount of a claim itself.
Here's a simple example of how life insurance works. Let's say Mr. Brown takes out a life $250,000 life insurance policy and names his wife as the beneficiary. He pays monthly premiums on the policy to the insurance company. A decade later, Mr. Brown dies in a car accident.
After processing the paperwork, the insurance company issues Mr. Brown's wife a
payout
for the policy amount—$250,000. She may also receive extra money since he died in an accident if the policy has a clause with an
accidental death benefit
, or if a rider for one was added.
What Is Professional Indemnity Insurance?
Professional indemnity insurance is a type of insurance that protects a business owner or professional if a client alleges that the business behaved negligently or failed to perform work adequately. This is different from
general liability insurance
, the type of insurance that protects a business in the event of an accidental injury on its premises.
What Is Hospital Indemnity Insurance?
Hospital indemnity insurance is a type of supplemental insurance that pays for hospitalization costs that are not covered by other insurance. This type of insurance is frequently taken out by businesses in case their employees are injured on the job.
What Is a Fixed Indemnity Insurance Plan?
Fixed indemnity insurance is a type of health insurance that pays out a fixed benefit for each healthcare event, regardless of the actual costs insured. A fixed indemnity plan might pay a certain amount of money for each hospital admission, or a certain amount for each day of hospitalization. These plans are exempt from the Affordable Care Act.
The Bottom Line
Indemnity insurance represents an important protection for businesses and professionals. In the event that a customer is dissatisfied with the company's work, this type of insurance will pay for the insured's legal defense and defray any settlement costs. This type of insurance is frequently used by doctors, lawyers, and other experts to protect against claims of negligence or malpractice.

7 Reasons You Haven’t Received Your Tax Refund

Definition
Turnover describes how quickly assets in a company are replaced within a specific period.
What Is Turnover?
Turnover is the pace that a company replaces assets within a certain period. It can include selling inventory, collecting receivables, or replacing employees. It can also represent the percentage of an investment portfolio that is replaced.
Turnover might also mean something different, depending on the area you’re in. For instance, in Europe and Asia,
overall turnover
is a synonym for a company’s total
revenues
.
Key Takeaways
The most common measures of corporate turnover look at accounts receivable and inventories.
Accounts receivable turnover shows how quickly payments are being collected compared to credit sales during a set period.
Inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory, showing how fast a company sells its inventory in a given period.
In the investment industry, turnover is the percentage of a portfolio that is sold in a particular month or year.
A high turnover indicates strong sales performance and operational efficiency.
Zoe Hansen / Investopedia
Why Turnover Matters
Turnover ratios
calculate how quickly a business conducts operations. This measures efficiency and how well it is using its resources.
Two of the largest assets owned by a business are usually accounts receivable and inventory, if any is kept. Both of these accounts require a significant cash investment, and it is important to measure how quickly a business collects cash. Turnover ratios are used by fundamental analysts and investors to assist them in determining if a company is managing its finances and assets correctly.
Common types of turnover ratios include:
Accounts receivable turnover
Inventory turnover
Portfolio turnover
Working capital turnover
Companies can better assess the efficiency of their operations by looking at a range of these ratios. Good turnover ratios can be high, midrange, or low, depending on what a company is measuring. For instance, a low accounts receivable turnover ratio means a company’s collection procedures or credit-issuing policies might need to be fixed. However, the same company might be a retailer with a high inventory turnover ratio, which can indicate strong sales.
What Is Accounts Receivable Turnover?
Accounts receivable represents the total dollar amount of unpaid customer invoices at any point in time. Assuming that credit sales are sales not immediately paid in cash, the
accounts receivable turnover
formula is credit sales divided by average accounts receivable. The average
accounts receivable
is simply the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable balances for a particular period, such as a month or year.
The accounts receivable turnover formula tells you how quickly you collect payments compared to your credit sales. For example, if credit sales for the month total $300,000 and the accounts receivable balance is $50,000, then the turnover rate is six. The goal is to maximize sales, minimize the receivable balance, and generate a large turnover rate.
Important
Accounts payable turnover
(sales divided by average payables) is a short-term
liquidity
measure that measures the rate at which a company pays back its suppliers and vendors.
What Is Inventory Turnover?
The
inventory turnover
formula, which is stated as the
cost of goods sold (COGS)
divided by average inventory, is similar to the accounts receivable formula.
When you sell inventory, the balance is moved to the cost of sales, which is an expense account. The goal as a business owner is to maximize the amount of
inventory
sold while minimizing the inventory that is kept on hand. For example, if the cost of sales for the month totals $400,000 and you carry $100,000 in inventory, your turnover rate is four, which indicates that you sold your entire inventory four times that month.
Inventory turnover, also known as sales turnover, helps investors determine the level of risk that they will face if providing operating capital to a company. Retailers tend to have the
highest inventory turnover
. The speed can be a factor of the industry in general or indicate a well-run company.
Fast Fact
The reciprocal of the inventory turnover ratio (1/inventory turnover) is the
days’ sales of inventory (DSI)
. This tells you how many days it takes, on average, to completely sell and replace a company’s inventory.
What Is Portfolio Turnover?
Turnover is a term that is also used for investments. In this context, turnover measures the percentage of an investment portfolio that is sold in a set period.
For instance, assume a
mutual fund
has $100 million in assets under management, and the portfolio manager sells $20 million in securities during the year. The rate of turnover is $20 million divided by $100 million, or 20%. A 20%
portfolio turnover
ratio could be interpreted to mean that the value of the trades represented one-fifth of the assets in the fund. However, it might also indicate a need to investigate further and determine why the mutual fund needed to replace 20% of its holdings in one year. In some cases, the fund’s manager might be churning the portfolio, or replacing holdings to generate commissions.
Portfolios that are actively managed should have a higher rate of turnover, while a passively managed portfolio may have fewer trades during the year. The actively managed portfolio will generate more trading costs, which reduce the
rate of return
on the portfolio. Investment funds with excessive turnover are often considered to be low quality.
What Is Asset Turnover?
The
asset turnover
ratio measures how well a company generates revenue from its
assets
during the year.

Total Sales
Beginning Assets
+
Ending Assets
2
where:

Ending Assets
=
Assets at end of year
\begin{aligned} &\text{Asset Turnover} = \frac{ \text{Total Sales} }{ \frac { \text{Beginning Assets}\ +\ \text{Ending Assets} }{ 2 } } \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{Total Sales} = \text{Annual sales total} \\ &\text{Beginning Assets} = \text{Assets at start of year} \\ &\text{Ending Assets} = \text{Assets at end of year} \\ \end{aligned}
​

​
where:
Total Sales
=
Annual sales total
Beginning Assets
=
Assets at start of year
Ending Assets
=
Assets at end of year
​
You can also use just the assets at the end of the period instead of the average for the year to calculate the ratio. Investors use this ratio to compare similar companies in the same sector or group.
Explain Like I’m 5 Years Old
Turnover is how fast something is replaced. Employee turnover, for example, is how fast employees leave the company and are then replaced by new employees. (As a company, you typically want to have low employee turnover.)
What Is the Meaning of Turnover in Business?
There are several different business turnover ratios, including accounts receivable, inventory, asset, portfolio, and working capital. These turnover ratios indicate how quickly the company replaces them.
What Is Turnover in the Workplace?
Workplace turnover generally refers to the rate at which employees leave and join a company. It is commonly called the employee turnover ratio and is generally an indicator of employee morale. It is also associated with the high costs of replacing exiting employees.
Is Turnover Your Profit?
Profit
refers to a company’s total revenues minus its expenses. Turnover is how quickly a company has sold its inventory, collected payments compared with sales, or replaced assets over a specific period. Generally speaking, turnover looks at the speed and efficiency of a company’s operations. Profit looks at how much money the company makes after expenses.
The Bottom Line
Turnover can be either an accounting concept or an investing concept. In accounting, it measures how quickly a business conducts its operations. In investing, it looks at what percentage of a portfolio is sold in a set period.
A business will have many types of turnover to measure, but the most common are
inventory and accounts receivable
. Accounts receivable turnover shows how quickly a business collects payments. Inventory turnover shows how fast a company sells its entire inventory. Investors can look at both types of turnover to assess how efficiently a company is run.

Investopedia,Zombies: Financial Term for Distressed Companies,"Close
What Are Zombies?
Zombies are companies that earn just enough money to continue operating and service
debt
but are unable to pay off their debt. Such companies, given that they just scrape by meeting
overheads
(wages, rent, interest payments on debt, for example), have no excess
capital
to invest to spur growth. Zombie companies are typically subject to higher borrowing costs and may be one just event—
market disruption
or a poor quarter performance—away from
insolvency
or a bailout. Zombies are especially dependent on banks for financing, which is fundamentally their life support. Zombie companies are also known as the ""living dead"" or ""zombie stocks.""
Key Takeaways:
Zombies are companies that earn just enough money to continue operating and service their debt.
Zombie companies have no excess capital to spur growth and are considered close to insolvency.
In rare cases, a zombie company might stretch itself financially, produce a lucrative product, and reduce its liabilities.
Zombies are high-risk investments, and not for the faint-hearted.
Understanding Zombies
Zombies often fail, falling victim to the high costs associated with debt or certain operations, such as research and development. They may lack the resources for capital investment, which would create growth. If a zombie company employed so many people that its failure would become a political issue, it may be deemed ""
too big to fail
,"" as was the case with many financial institutions during the 2008 financial crisis. Given that many analysts expect that zombies will eventually be unable to meet their financial obligations, such companies are considered riskier investments and will, therefore, see their share prices suppressed.
Zombies were first spoken of in reference to companies in Japan during the country's ""
Lost Decade
"" of the 1990s following the bursting of its
asset price bubble
. During this period, companies were dependent on bank backing to remain in operation, even though they were bloated, inefficient, or failing. Economists argue that the economy would have been better served by allowing such poorly performing companies to fail. The term ""zombies"" was picked up again in 2008 in response to U.S. government bailouts that were part of the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
.
While the ranks of zombie companies are small, years of loose
monetary policy
highlighted by
quantitative easing
, high leverage and historically low interest rates, have contributed to their growth. Economists argue that such policies preserve inefficiencies while stifling productivity, growth, and innovation. When the market shifts, zombies will be the first to fall victim, unable to meet their basic obligations as rising interest rates make their debt more expensive to service. Meanwhile, successful companies, which are less able to build on their success because of tight credit, may feel any downturn more than they should.
While keeping zombies on life support may preserve jobs, economists note that using such resources is misguided because it impedes growth at successful firms and, therefore, inhibits job creation.
Special Considerations
Zombie Investors
Because a zombie's life expectancy tends to be highly unpredictable, zombie stocks are extremely risky and are not suitable for all investors. For example, a small biotech firm may stretch its funds extremely thin by concentrating its efforts in research and development in the hope of creating a blockbuster drug. If the drug fails, the company can go
bankrupt
within days of the announcement. On the other hand, if the drug is successful, the company could profit and reduce its liabilities. In most cases, however, zombie stocks are unable to overcome the financial burdens of their high burn rates and most eventually dissolve.
Given the lack of attention paid to this group, there are often interesting opportunities for investors who have a high risk tolerance and are seeking speculative opportunities.

Definition
Alpha is a measure of an investment's performance that indicates its ability to generate returns in excess of its benchmark.
What Is Alpha?
Alpha (α) is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy’s ability to beat the market, or its “edge.” Alpha is thus also often referred to as
excess return
or the
abnormal rate of return
in relation to a benchmark, when adjusted for risk.
Alpha is often used in conjunction with
beta
(the Greek letter β), which measures the broad market’s overall
volatility
or risk, known as
systematic market risk
.
Alpha is used in finance as a measure of
performance
, indicating when a strategy, trader, or portfolio manager has managed to beat the market return or other benchmark over some period. Alpha, often considered the
active return
on an investment, gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market’s movement as a whole.
The excess return of an investment relative to the
return
of a benchmark index is the investment’s alpha. Alpha may be positive or negative and is the result of active investing. Beta, on the other hand, can be earned through passive
index investing
.
Key Takeaways
Alpha refers to excess returns earned on an investment above the benchmark return when adjusted for risk.
Active portfolio managers seek to generate alpha in diversified portfolios, with diversification intended to eliminate unsystematic risk.
Because alpha represents the performance of a portfolio relative to a benchmark, it is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund’s return.
Jensen’s alpha takes into consideration the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and includes a risk-adjusted component in its calculation.
Sydney Saporito / Investopedia
Understanding Alpha
Alpha is one of five popular technical investment
risk ratios
. The others are beta,
standard deviation
,
R-squared
, and the
Sharpe ratio
. These are all statistical measurements used in
modern portfolio theory (MPT)
. All of these indicators are intended to help investors determine the risk-return profile of an investment.

Active portfolio managers seek to generate alpha in diversified portfolios, with
diversification
intended to eliminate
unsystematic risk
. Because alpha represents the performance of a
portfolio
relative to a benchmark, it is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund’s return.
In other words, alpha is the return on an investment that is not a result of a general movement in the greater market. As such, an alpha of zero would indicate that the portfolio or fund is tracking perfectly with the benchmark index and that the manager has not added or lost any additional value compared to the broad market.
Applying Alpha to Investing
The concept of alpha became more popular with the advent of
smart beta
index funds tied to indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. These funds attempt to enhance the performance of a portfolio that tracks a targeted subset of the market.
Despite the considerable desirability of alpha in a portfolio, many index benchmarks manage to beat asset managers the vast majority of the time. Due in part to a growing lack of faith in traditional financial advising brought about by this trend, more and more investors are switching to low-cost,
passive
online advisors (often called
robo-advisors
​) who exclusively or almost exclusively invest clients’ capital into index-tracking funds, the rationale being that if they
cannot beat the market
, they may as well join it.
Moreover, because most traditional financial advisors charge a fee, when one manages a portfolio and nets an alpha of zero, it actually represents a slight
net loss
for the investor. For example, suppose that Jim, a financial advisor, charges 1% of a portfolio’s value for his services and that during a 12-month period, Jim managed to produce an alpha of 0.75 for the portfolio of one of his clients, Frank.
While Jim has indeed helped the performance of Frank’s portfolio, the fee that Jim charges is in excess of the alpha he has generated, so Frank’s portfolio has experienced a net loss. For investors, the example highlights the importance of considering fees in conjunction with performance returns and alpha.
Efficient Market Hypothesis
The
efficient market hypothesis (EMH)
postulates that market prices incorporate all available information at all times, so securities are always properly priced (the market is efficient). Therefore, according to the EMH, there is no way to systematically identify and take advantage of mispricings in the market because they do not exist.
If mispricings are identified, they are quickly
arbitraged
away, so persistent patterns of market anomalies that can be taken advantage of tend to be few and far between.
Empirical evidence comparing historical returns of active mutual funds relative to their passive benchmarks indicates that fewer than 10% of all active funds are able to earn a positive alpha over a 10-plus-year time period, and this percentage falls once taxes and fees are taken into consideration. In other words, alpha is hard to come by, especially after taxes and fees.
Because beta risk can be isolated by diversifying and
hedging
various risks (which comes with various transaction costs), some have proposed that alpha does not really exist, but simply represents the compensation for taking some unhedged risk that hadn’t been identified or was overlooked.
Seeking Investment Alpha
Alpha is commonly used to rank active mutual funds as well as all other types of investments. It is often represented as a single number (like +3.0 or -5.0) and typically refers to a percentage measuring how the portfolio or fund performed compared to the referenced benchmark index (i.e., 3% better or 5% worse).
A deeper analysis of alpha may also include
Jensen’s alpha
. Jensen’s alpha takes into consideration the
capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
market theory and includes a risk-adjusted component in its calculation. Beta (or the beta coefficient) is used in the CAPM, which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its own particular beta and the expected market returns.
Alpha and beta
are used together by investment managers to calculate, compare, and analyze returns.
The entire investing universe offers a broad range of securities, investment products, and advisory options for investors to consider. Different market cycles also have an influence on the alpha of investments across different asset classes. This is why risk-return metrics are important to consider in conjunction with alpha.
Example of Alpha
Alpha is illustrated in the following two historical examples of a fixed-income
exchange-traded fund (ETF)
and an equity ETF:
The
iShares
Convertible Bond ETF (
ICVT
) is a fixed-income investment with low risk. It tracks a customized index called the Bloomberg U.S. Convertible Cash Pay Bond > $250MM Index. The three-year standard deviation was 18.94% as of Feb. 28, 2022. The year-to-date return, as of Feb. 28, 2022, was -6.67%. The Bloomberg U.S. Convertible Cash Pay Bond > $250MM Index had a return of -13.17% over the same period. Therefore, the alpha for ICVT was 6.5% compared to the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index and a three-year standard deviation of 18.97%.
1
However, since the aggregate bond index is not the proper benchmark for ICVT (it should be the Bloomberg Convertible index), this alpha may not be as large as initially thought; in fact, it may be misattributed since
convertible bonds
have far riskier profiles than plain vanilla bonds.
The WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (
DGRW
) is an equity investment with higher market risk that seeks to invest in dividend growth equities. Its holdings track a customized index called the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Index. It had a three-year annualized standard deviation of 10.58%, higher than ICVT.
2
As of Feb. 28, 2022, DGRW’s annualized return was 18.1%, which was also higher than the S&P 500 at 16.4%, so it had an alpha of 1.7% compared to the S&P 500. But again, the S&P 500 may not be the correct benchma",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp

A limit order is a buy or sell order for a stock or other asset that is executed automatically when the price reaches or exceeds a specified level.
What Is a Limit Order?
A limit order in the financial markets is an instruction to purchase or sell a stock or other security at a specified price or better. A limit can be placed on either a buy or a sell order:
A buy limit order will be executed only at the limit price or lower.
A sell limit order will be executed only at the limit price or higher.
Limit orders will be executed only if the price meets the order qualifications.
The alternative to a limit order is a market order, which calls for a trade to be executed at the prevailing market price without any price limit specified.
Key Takeaways
A limit order guarantees that an order will be filled at the specified price or better.
Limit orders are used with stop orders to prevent large downside losses.
A limit order can be valid for a number of days, until the order is filled, or until the trader cancels the order.
Investopedia / Joules Garcia
How Limit Orders Work
A limit order allows traders to set a pre-determined price to buy or sell a
security
. For example, imagine a trader who wants to buy stock in XYZ company, currently trading for $17.00. If the trader sets a limit buy order at $14.50, they will only buy the stock if the share price falls to $14.50 or lower.

Conversely, the trader might have shares of XYZ’s stock and want to sell them if the price increases. The trader might set a limit sell order at $20, which will only sell the shares if the price rises to $20 or higher.
By
using a buy limit order
, the investor is guaranteed to pay the buy limit order price or better, but it is not guaranteed that the order will be filled. A limit order gives a trader more control over the
execution
price of a security, especially if they are fearful of using a
market order
during periods of heightened
volatility
.
Limit orders are useful when prices are rising or falling quickly, and the trader is worried about getting a bad fill from a market order. Additionally, a limit order can be useful if a trader is not watching a stock and has a specific price in mind at which they would be happy to buy or sell that security. Limit orders can also be left open with an expiration date.
Limit Order Example
Imagine a portfolio manager who wants to buy Tesla Inc.'s (
TSLA
) stock but believes its current valuation at roughly $750 per share is too high. The manager would prefer to buy the stock at a lower price.
The PM instructs his traders to buy 10,000 shares of Tesla should the price fall below $650,
good 'til canceled
. The trader then places an order to buy 10,000 shares with a $650 limit. If the stock falls below that price, the limit order will automatically execute and buy up to 10,000 shares for $650 per share or lower. The order will remain open until the stock reaches the PM’s limit or the PM cancels the order.
Additionally, the PM would like to sell Amazon.com Inc.'s (
AMZN
) stock but feels its current price of roughly $2,300 is too low. The PM instructs his trader to sell 5,000 shares should the price rise above $2,750, good until canceled. The trader will then place a limit sell order for 5,000 shares with a $2,750 limit.
Fast Fact
Brokerage firms may not allow limit orders if they are illogical (i.e. if a limit to buy is placed at greater than price), Brokerage firms may also offer this service to investors for free.
Limit Orders vs. Market Orders
When an investor places an order to buy or sell a stock, there are two main execution options in terms of price: place the order ""at the market"" or ""at the limit."" Market orders are transactions meant to be executed as quickly as possible at the present or market price. Conversely, a limit order sets the maximum or minimum price to buy or sell an asset. Brokers will
frequently set higher fees
for completing the more complicated limit order.
Buying stocks can be thought of as an analogy to buying a car. With a car, you can pay the dealer’s sticker price and get the car, or you can negotiate a price and refuse to finalize the deal unless the dealer meets your price. The stock market can be thought of as working in a similar way.
A market order deals with the execution of the order; The price is secondary to the speed of completing the trade. Limit orders deal primarily with the price. If the security's value is currently outside of the parameters set in the limit order, the transaction does not occur.
Explain Like I'm Five
Traders use limit orders to set their prices for buying or selling an asset. Instead of having to constantly watch the market for price changes, they can set a limit order that automatically executes when the price reaches the desired level.
A limit order will only execute at the limit price or better. If you set a limit buy order of $5, it will only buy the asset if the price falls to $5 or lower. If you set a limit sell order of $10, it will sell the asset if the price reaches $10 or higher.
What Is a Limit Order?
A limit order is an instruction to a broker to buy or sell an asset at a specific price or better. It allows traders to execute trades at a desired price without having to constantly monitor markets. It is also a way to hedge risk and ensure losses are minimized by capturing sale prices at certain levels.
How Does a Limit Order Work?
A limit order is placed with your broker. That limit order states the security, the quantity, the price, and whether you are in a buy or sell position. The order is not triggered until the specific desired market price is achieved. Even then, execution of the limit order is not guaranteed, especially in highly volatile markets or regarding highly volatile securities with low liquidity.
What Is the Difference Between a Limit Order and a Stop-Limit Order?
A limit order is an order requesting the purchase or sale of securities should a specific price be met. A stop-limit order builds one additional layer that requires a specific price be met that is different than the sale price. For example, a limit order to sell your security for $15 will likely execute when the market price reaches $15. Alternatively, a stop-limit order can be placed to sell your security for $15 only if the share price has dropped from $20 to $16.
How Long Does a Limit Order Last?
The term of the limit order will depend on your specification and your broker’s policy. Many brokers default limit orders to day-only trades; any unfilled orders at market close are canceled without execution. Other brokers may offer a specific number of days, often in intervals of 30 (i.e. 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days). Last, some brokers offer limit orders that are considered good until filled; the limit order will remain valid until it is filled or deliberately canceled by the trader.
Why Did My Limit Order Not Get Filled?
A limit order may not get filled for a few reasons. First, your limit order will only trigger when market prices reach the limit price. If a security is trading above your buy price or below your sell price, it will likely not fill until there is price action on your security.
A limit order can only fill if a security has liquidity. If the security does not have enough shares trading at the specific price you placed, your order may not fill. This is most common for larger orders placed on low-volume securities. If you place a limit buy order for 100 shares, but only 50 shares are offered at the limit price, your order will only be partially filled.
The Bottom Line
A limit order is one of several order types that traders can choose from when buying or selling assets. While market orders are executed immediately, a limit order is only executed if the price reaches a certain level or better. This allows investors to automate their trades, instead of constantly watching the market for price changes.

Investopedia,The Rise and Fall of WorldCom: Story of a Scandal,"Close
Definition
WorldCom was a major telecom company and one of the largest long-distance providers in the U.S. until its collapse in 2006 due to an accounting fraud scandal and subsequent bankruptcy.
What Was WorldCom?
WorldCom was an American telecom company. At its height, WorldCom was one of the largest long-distance providers in the United States. The company is best known for being embroiled in one of the largest accounting scandals in the country, which came on the heels of the Enron and
Tyco
frauds. This came after it was revealed the company
cooked its books
.
WorldCom was also involved in one of the largest
bankruptcies
of all time. The company came out of bankruptcy, rebranded itself, and its network assets were sold to Verizon.
Key Takeaways
WorldCom was a telecommunications company that was established in 1983 by Murray Waldron, William Rector, and Bernard Ebbers.
The company provided discount long-distance services to its customers and pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy that propelled it to the largest company of its kind in the U.S.
WorldCom was in financial trouble and used fraudulent accounting techniques to hide its losses from investors and others.
The company filed for bankruptcy because of the scandal, and several key figures were punished, including its CEO and CFO.
WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy, restructured, and was purchased by Verizon.
A Brief History of WorldCom's Accounting Fraud Scandal
WorldCom is now a byword for
accounting fraud
and a warning to investors that when things seem too good to be true, they just might be. The company was founded in 1983 as Long Distance Discount Service.
1
It was established after the breakup of AT&T by Murray Waldron, William Rector, early investor Bernard Ebbers, and their business partners. The group secured a $650,000 loan, which allowed them to buy the technology to route long-distance calls.
2
3
Since courts ordered AT&T to lease its phone lines to new companies at cheap rates, Ebbers, who was the company’s
chief executive officer (CEO)
, could offer his customers very low rates. This allowed him to build the company into one of America’s leading long-distance phone companies by acquiring as many as 30 competing telecom companies. At the peak of the
dotcom bubble
, WorldCom’s
market capitalization
grew to $186 billion.
4
When the tech boom turned to bust, and companies slashed spending on telecom services and equipment, WorldCom resorted to accounting tricks to maintain the appearance of ever-growing profitability. By then, many investors became suspicious of Ebbers’ story—especially after the
Enron
scandal broke in the summer of 2001.
5
6
In 2002, it was revealed that Ebbers borrowed $408 million from WorldCom’s board of directors to cover
margin calls
on loans secured by company stock. At the same time, the company’s accounting fraud and real financial situation were coming to light as the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
began to investigate. As a result, Ebbers met his downfall and resigned as CEO on April 30, 2002. In 2005, he was convicted of
securities fraud
, conspiracy, and making false filings, and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
7
Fast Fact
Ebbers was a larger-than-life figure whose trademark was a 10-gallon hat and cowboy boots.
Cooking the Books
There were several factors that pushed WorldCom into a loss. The company pursued acquisitions aggressively, buying up rival companies in an attempt to gain
market share
. This, coupled with a major drop in revenue and rates, pushed the company further into the
red
. Executives needed a way to prove WorldCom was still financially viable to its board and shareholders.
WorldCom used a series of questionable
accounting
techniques to hide its financial position, which inflated its profits. This amounted to billions in capital expenditures being improperly recorded on the books. But this was hardly a sophisticated fraud.
To hide its falling profitability, WorldCom inflated net income and cash flow by recording expenses as investments. By
capitalizing
expenses, it exaggerated income by $3.8 billion, including $3.055 billion in 2001 and $797 million in the first quarter of 2002, reporting a net profit of $1.38 billion instead of a
net loss
.

Important
To hide its falling profitability, WorldCom inflated its net income and cash flow by recording expenses as investments, reporting a profit of $1.38 billion—instead of a net loss.
8
The Whistleblowers
Several individuals played a key role in exposing the fraud at WorldCom. These people included Cynthia Cooper, who was vice president of WorldCom’s
internal audit
department, and Gene Morse, another auditor. They became concerned about several inconsistencies in the company’s financial records, including:
The use of
reserves
to boost the company’s income
The company’s
capital expenditures
, which another employee questioned and was fired over
Complicated accounting terms (such as prepaid capacity), which were used to hide the movement of
capital
The lack of evidence to substantiate certain financial
transactions
, including a $500 million capital expenditure
Cooper and Morse conducted investigations on their own as well as an audit. They were challenged by the company’s
chief financial officer (CFO)
, Scott Sullivan, who requested that the process be delayed. They contacted KPMG, the external auditor that replaced Arthur Andersen, as well as WorldCom’s audit committee.
10
As a result of her diligence, Cooper was named a Person of the Year by Time and was featured on the magazine’s cover in 2002.
11
She is now an author, consultant, and internationally recognized speaker.
12
WorldCom Bankruptcy
The company could no longer keep up once things started to unravel. In fact, WorldCom had to
adjust its earnings
for the period from 1999 to 2002 by $11 billion, and the fraud was estimated to be in the neighborhood of $79.5 billion.
Bankruptcy was the only option. WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 21, 2002, only a month after its now-former auditor, Arthur Andersen, had been found guilty in court and lost its license to practice accounting.
13
By this time, the company was indebted to its creditors by as much as $7.7 billion. In its filing, the company noted $107 billion in
assets
and $41 billion worth of
debt
.
14
The filing allowed WorldCom to provide some restitution. Doing so allowed existing customers to continue receiving services. WorldCom was also able to pay its employees and keep its assets. It also provided some much-needed time to
restructure
even though it lost its luster within the corporate marketplace.
Fallout and Aftermath
Some of the key personnel involved in the firm’s accounting scandal received harsh punishment for their roles, including:
Bernard Ebbers was convicted on one count of securities fraud, one count of conspiracy, and seven counts of fraud related to false SEC filings. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2005.
15
Ebbers was granted early release from prison on Dec. 18, 2019, for health reasons after serving about 13 years of his sentence.
16
He died in 2020, shortly after his release.
17
Former CFO Scott Sullivan received a five-year jail sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against Ebbers.
15
Debtor-in-possession financing
from Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and GE Capital allowed the company to survive.
18
It emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 and rebranded itself as MCI—a telecom company WorldCom acquired in 1997.
19
Verizon purchased MCI and its assets in 2006.
1
WorldCom’s former banks settled lawsuits with creditors for $6 billion without admitting liability. Around $5 billion went to the bondholders, with the balance going to former shareholders.
20
In a settlement with the SEC, the newly formed MCI agreed to pay shareholders and bondholders $500 million in cash and 10 million shares of MCI.
21
This spate of corporate crime led to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
in July 2002, which strengthened disclosure requirements and the penalties for fraudulent accounting.
22
In the aftermath, WorldCom left a stain on the reputation of accounting firms, investment banks, and credit rating agencies that had never quite been removed.
Who Was to Blame?
Although no one actually admitted their part in the scandal, there were several players who were at fault—some within the company and others who weren’t even employed by WorldCom.
Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that audited WorldCom’s 2001
financial statements
and reviewed WorldCom’s books for Q1 2002, was found to have ignored memos from WorldCom executives informing them that the company was inflating profits by improperly accounting for expenses.
Key management personnel, including WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers and CFO Scott Sullivan, the company’s board of directors, and its internal audit team, were also singled out for their lack of oversight, ignoring of
accounting principles
, and committing fraud. Ebbers and his lawyer initially denied any involvement or knowledge of the fraud. These claims were refuted by a
Wall Street Journal
report, which cited internal communications to the contrary.
Wall Street
analyst Jack Grubman gave the company consistently high ratings even though the company (along with other telecoms) performed poorly. Grubman was fired from his job at Salomon Smith Barney and was fined $15 million by the SEC. He was also banned from any activity in securities exchanges.
23
What Happened to WorldCom?
WorldCom was a telecommunications company that provided discount long-distance services to its customers. The company was embroiled in one of the largest accounting scandals in the United States, which led to an equally large bankruptcy filing. The company used fraudulent accounting practices to cover up its losses by making itself look more profitable than it was.

Investopedia,Triple Bottom Line,"Close
Definition
The triple bottom line (TBL) concept states that company performance should be measured on social issues and environmental sustainability as much as on company profits.
What Is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)?
The concept of the triple bottom line (TBL) maintains that company performance should be measured equally on social issues, environmental goals, and corporate profits. TBL theory posits that instead of one bottom line, there should be three: profit, people, and the planet.
TBL was developed in 1994 by John Elkington, a British management consultant and sustainability guru. The idea is that a company should be judged not only by how much money it makes but by whether it improves people's lives and the well-being of the planet.
1
Key Takeaways
The triple bottom line aims to measure the financial, social, and environmental performance of a company over time.
Some performance measures include employee retention, increased external investments, and higher sales from customers committed to social and environmental goals.
Some criticize TBL as difficult to measure, costly to implement, and conducive to competing strategies across its components.
Understanding the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)
In finance, when speaking of a company's
bottom line
, we usually mean its profits. Elkington's TBL framework advances the goal of sustainability in business practices, in which companies look beyond profits to include social and environmental issues to measure the
full cost of doing business. Triple-bottom-line theory says that companies should focus as much attention on social and environmental issues as they do on financial issues.
TBL theory also says that if a company focuses on finances only and does not
examine how it interacts socially, it is not able to see the whole picture and therefore cannot account for the full cost of doing business.
The 3 Ps of the Triple Bottom Line
According to TBL theory, companies should be working simultaneously on these three bottom lines:

Profit
:
This is the traditional measure of corporate profit—the
profit and loss
(P&L) account.
People
: This measures how socially responsible an organization has been throughout its history.
Planet
:
This measures how environmentally responsible a firm has been.
2
Profit
In the context of the triple bottom line, profit can mean more than just how much money a company makes. A company must ensure it earns its income in ethical, fair manners. This includes soliciting business partners and vendors with which it aligns philanthropically. It also defines how a company develops its strategy or
financial operating plan
. For instance, profit also ties to a company's responsibility to pay its lenders, creditors, and employees what is due to them and to have a sense of financial responsibility for these obligations.
Some users of the triple bottom line may also say profit refers to not only a company's profit but the profit of those around the company. This specifically refers to the community in which the business operates. This may include:
Ensuring the company is paying its fair share of local, state, or federal income taxes on a timely basis
Making sure the company is fostering economic wealth within its community by shopping local or utilizing small businesses.
Committing to financially investing in the community through partnerships, developments, or
corporate sponsorships
.
People
In the context of triple bottom line, people refers to every individual that is in touch with a company. This includes but is not limited to:
Employees.
This means ensuring workers receive a fair wage in a safe environment that encourages professional development.
Vendors.
This means ensuring a diverse set of suppliers are used and prioritizing small businesses or minority-owners when appropriate.
Customers.
This means ensuring customers have fair access to products and their feedback regarding equity or safety are considered.
Traditionally, a company would prioritize investors or shareholders. Triple bottom line shifts the focus to individuals potentially not financially invested in the company but still tangentially involved with its operations. Now, instead of attempting to create value by only increasing investor returns, triple bottom line strives to create value by encouraging volunteerism of its employees or support or business success of small suppliers, for example.
Planet
The largest deviation from purely financial reporting relates to reporting on environmental impacts. Often, a company must be forced between a lower-cost option or a more environmentally-friendly alternative. A company may also choose between a less favorable alternative; for example, eco-friendly transit will likely be slower than aircraft.
Instead of reporting a company's positive changes to the planet, it is often much easier to assess the impacts of the alternatives elected by the company. Imagine a company that redesigned its distribution channels to reduce its energy use; such an activity would be reported as saving a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
Important
Some users of triple bottom line may replace 'profit' with 'prosperity'; both terms are meant to be interchangeable and refer to the long-term health of the company and its programs.
How to Measure the Triple Bottom Line
Companies may need to get creative when
measuring the triple bottom line
. Traditional accounting rules provide very strong guidance on how a company must record its accounting profit. Alternatively, there may be minimal to no structure in place on how a company must measure its triple bottom line, especially considering there may be no external reporting requirement to do so.
Measuring Profit
A company will still usually report company-wide net income as part of its triple bottom line. For this reason, profit is the easiest component of triple bottom line to report as it already has strong guidance. However, it may also report or call out several other profitability or
financial metrics
such as:
Gross margin by geographical region to demonstrate consistent or equitable pricing across different demographic groups.
Historical federal income tax payments, demonstrating its effective rate.
Historical information (or lack of) late payments or penalties as a demonstration of financial responsibility.
Measuring People
Also referred to as social measures or social metrics, the people component of triple bottom line may contain financial or non-financial measurements. Again, some may be stipulated by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or other reporting rules, while others may be internally-sourced data. Examples of measurements of people include:
Average employee payroll to demonstrate livable wages that exceed local expectations for pay.
Average
employee benefits
per employee beyond pay to demonstrate the full benefit package per worker.
Average number of vacation hours earned and used per employee to ensure workers can and have been stepping away from work.
Employment demographics such as proportion of employees in different age, race, sexual orientation, or religious groups. Note that some of this information may be sensitive and must be provided voluntarily by employees (as employers are not entitled to some demographic information.
Vendor demographics such as businesses identifying as small businesses, LGBTQ-owned, Veteran-owned, or
minority-owned
.
Number of product returns by geographical regions to ensure certain demographics are still receiving quality products.
Measuring Planet
Perhaps the most difficult triple bottom line component to measure is planet. As a company may need to know its existing impact as well as its ""eco-friendly"" impact, measuring impacts to the planet may require the most expertise or effort. However, there are very common environmental measurements such as:
Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions based on the difference between former processes and forecasted changes in new processes.
Amount of waste generated in pounds; this may also include amount of recycled product over a period of time.
Amount of energy consumption, adjusted for seasonality.
Amount of fossil fuel consumption (may be adjusted for per-employee or per-sales lead should the company be growing).
Proportion of
raw materials
sourced ethically.
Fast Fact
To promote each category as being equally important to one another, a true triple bottom report will have a consistent number of measurements for profit, people, and planet.
Advantages and Disadvantages of the Triple Bottom Line
Advantages of Applying the Triple Bottom Line
The obvious reason to apply the triple bottom line is to have a greater positive impact on the world. Instead of focusing on paper profit, companies can quantifiably determine how the business is favorably changing the world and the people it engages with.
Having a greater philanthropic presence may encourage employee retention and decrease
attrition
. Workers may be more likely to commit to a company if its environmental impacts are communicated. In addition, favorable working conditions including competitive wages, training, and time off to volunteer may keep employees around; this may reduce recruiting, training, onboarding, and general costs of new employees.
A greater triple bottom line plan may also entice customers and
consciously capitalistic investors
interested in prioritizing certain non-financial metrics over financial metrics. Some customers may be torn between two similar products; the deciding factor may be the ESG prioritization of the companies. In addition, investors may actively seek to put their money into a company that has social and environmental plans.

A journal is a detailed running record of all of a business's financial transactions. It is used to reconcile accounts and is transferred to other accounting records, such as the
general ledger
. The journal includes information like the transaction date, the accounts affected, and the dollar amounts. Most journal entries are composed in a double-entry bookkeeping method.
Key Takeaways
A journal is a detailed record of all transactions done by a business used to reconcile accounts.
Entries are usually recorded using a double-entry method.
Entries identify the account affected with a debit or credit—the totals of which must be equal.
Single-entry bookkeeping is rarely used.
In the investing world, a journal is a running list of trades made by an investor and why.
Understanding a Journal
For
accounting
purposes, a journal may be a physical record or a digital document stored as a book, a spreadsheet, or data entered into accounting software. When a transaction is made, a bookkeeper records it as a journal entry. If the expense or income affects one or more business accounts, the journal entry will detail that as well.
Journaling is an essential part of objective accounting and record-keeping. Journals are easy to review and can be easily transferred later in the accounting process. In addition to the general ledger, journals are often reviewed as part of a trade or audit process.
Information recorded in a journal may include sales, expenses, movements of cash, inventory, and
debt
. The information is best recorded immediately for the sake of accuracy. An accurate journal is critical to business planning,
budgeting
, and
tax preparation
.
Types of Journal Entries
The following are the key journal entries that are used in accounting—all of which highlight a company's health and well-being.
Opening entry:
This entry carries over the closing balance from the previous accounting period and becomes the opening balance.
Adjusting entry:
This entry adjusts any errors or makes changes to any entries that weren't previously accounted for, and are inputted into the general ledger at the end of the accounting period.
Reversing entry:
This type of entry is done at the beginning of the accounting period and makes adjustments to adjusting entries made in the last period.
Compound entry:
A compound entry documents multiple transactions with debits and credits. The rule of thumb is that the debit column must equal the credit column.
Closing entry:
A closing entry is the final balance in the journal, appearing at the end of the accounting period. It becomes the opening entry in the next period.
Using Double-Entry Bookkeeping in Journals
Double-entry bookkeeping
is the most common system of accounting. Every business transaction is made up of an exchange between two accounts. Thus, every journal entry is recorded with two columns.
For example, if a business owner purchases $1,000 worth of
inventory
using cash, the bookkeeper records two transactions in a journal entry. The
cash account
will show a credit of $1,000, and the inventory account, which is a current asset, will show a debit of $1,000.
Important
One of the primary rules for double-entry journal entries is to debit what comes in and credit what goes out for real accounts.
Using Single-Entry Bookkeeping in Journals
Single-entry bookkeeping is rarely used in accounting and business. It is the most basic form of accounting and is set up like a checkbook, in that only a single account is used for each journal entry. It is a simple running total of
cash inflows
and cash outflows.
For example, if a business owner purchases $1,000 worth of inventory with cash, the single-entry system records a $1,000 reduction in cash, with the total ending balance below it. Separately, another line indicates that $1,000 has been deducted from the cash account.
It is possible to separate income and expenses into two columns so a business can track total income and total expenses, and not just the aggregate ending balance.
The Journal in Investing and Trading
A journal is also used by those in the investment finance sector. For an individual investor or professional money manager, a journal is a comprehensive and detailed record of trades in the investor's accounts and can be used for tax, evaluation, and
auditing
purposes.
Traders use journals
to keep a chronicle of their trading activities and to learn from past successes and failures. Over time, a trader can sometimes spot the errors, emotional decisions, or divergence from an investing strategy that caused a loss.
The investor's journal typically has a record of profitable trades, unprofitable trades, watch lists, pre- and post-market records, and notes on why an investment was purchased or sold.
What Information Must Be Recorded in a Business Journal?
Every entry in a business journal must contain all critical information about a transaction. In double-entry accounting, this means the date of the transaction, the amount to be credited and debited, a brief description of the transaction, and the business accounts that are affected by it.
Depending on the business, the journal may make room for other entries, such as the tax implications or the impact on a subsidiary.
What Are the Types of Journals?
The word journal has different meanings, but all of them refer to a running record of events:
A personal journal is to record and reflect on events in a person's life over time.
A published journal is devoted to reporting news and events. Some are specialized publications devoted to scientific, medical, professional, or trade interests.
A business journal is used to record business transactions as they occur.
What's the Difference Between a Journal and a Diary?
The terms are virtually interchangeable. However, the word diary implies a personal record of daily activities and events, while a journal is often used to explore thoughts and ideas in depth.
The Bottom Line
Every business needs a journal. This running account of transactions is critical for recording the day-to-day activities of the business. It is used to reconcile other records and ensure that management has an accurate picture of business activities. The journal is also used for other reasons, such as evaluating business successes and missteps to preparing taxes or withstanding an audit.
Correction—Jan. 30, 2023:
This article was edited to reflect that in the double-entry system, transactions are recorded in terms of debits and credits, not increases and decreases. Debits do not always equate to increases, and credits do not always equate to decreases.

What Was the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)?
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented to promote trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The agreement, which eliminated most tariffs on trade among the three countries, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994. Numerous tariffs, particularly those related to agricultural products, textiles, and automobiles, were gradually phased out through Jan. 1, 2008.
NAFTA was terminated and replaced by the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
in 2020.
Key Takeaways
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented in 1994 to encourage trade among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
NAFTA reduced or eliminated tariffs on imports and exports among the three participating countries, creating a huge free-trade zone.
Two side agreements to NAFTA aimed to establish high common standards in workplace safety, labor rights, and environmental protection, to prevent businesses from relocating to other countries to exploit lower wages or looser regulations.
It was later replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was signed on Nov. 30, 2018, and went into full force on July 1, 2020.
NAFTA was a controversial agreement, harming the U.S.
economy
in some measures and improving it in others.
Sydney Saporito / Investopedia
Understanding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
NAFTA was an agreement that created a
free trade area
among the three major countries in North America: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The deal was signed by the three parties in 1992 and went into effect two years later.
1
It aimed to encourage economic activity among North America’s three major economic powers. Its primary focus was to open up and expand
trade
in the agricultural, automotive, and textile industries. Some of its main goals included:
Reduction of trade barriers
Creation of trade rules
Improvement of working conditions
Establishment of a safe market for North American goods and services
Expansion of global trade and cooperation

Proponents of the agreement believed that it would benefit the three nations involved by promoting freer trade and lower tariffs among them. Some experts also suggested that aligning Mexico with the more established economies of the U.S. and Canada would help boost its
economic growth
.
2
History of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
Legislation for NAFTA was developed during George H.W. Bush’s presidency as the first phase of his
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative
. The agreement was built on an existing agreement between the U.S. and Canada: the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement from 1989. The U.S. began trade talks with Mexico three years later, adding Canada to the negotiations.
3
The Clinton administration believed NAFTA would create 200,000 U.S. jobs within two years and a million within five years because exports played a major role in U.S. economic growth.
As of November 2024, about 29% of all U.S. imports originate from Mexico and Canada. They are, respectively, the United States’ first- and second-largest suppliers of imported goods. Approximately 32% of U.S. exports are destined for Canada and Mexico as of November 2024.
4
Important
Under President Bill Clinton, the White House anticipated a dramatic increase in
U.S. imports from Mexico
as a result of the lower tariffs through NAFTA.
Additions to NAFTA
NAFTA’s provisions were supplemented by two other regulations. The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) intended to prevent businesses from relocating to other countries to exploit lower wages, more lenient worker health and safety laws, and looser environmental regulations.
NAFTA did not eliminate regulatory requirements on companies wishing to trade internationally, such as rule-of-origin regulations and documentation requirements that determine whether certain goods can be traded under NAFTA.
The
free trade
agreement also contained administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for businesses that violate any of the three countries’ laws or customs procedures.
Provisions of NAFTA
The full text of the trade agreement consisted of 22 chapters, divided into eight sections, as well as additional annexes and appendices. Each section was broadly aimed at facilitating trade within the hemisphere and eliminating trade barriers. The most important provisions are highlighted below.
Elimination of Trade Barriers
One of the main goals of NAFTA was to eliminate most tariffs and other restrictions on trade among the three countries. Before the implementation of NAFTA, high import tariffs discouraged cross-border trade in some manufactured goods. The agreement also sought to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade such as border processing and licensing requirements.
Intellectual Property Protections
NAFTA also provided increased protections for
intellectual property
, such as trade secrets and computer software. These protections increased the incentives for cross-border trade because they reduced the risk of losing business secrets to an international competitor.
Environmental and Labor Protections
In response to critics who argued that NAFTA would lead to a decline in environmental and labor standards, the Clinton administration negotiated several side agreements to ensure protections for the environment and labor rights.
The first of these, the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, included provisions to prevent child labor and other abuses but stopped short of protecting the right to organize. The second, the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, introduced a commission to assess the results of liberalization on environmental regulations.
Dispute Resolution
To further facilitate cross-border trade, the agreement included a dispute resolution process for disagreements among investors, businesses, and state governments. This process was heavily criticized in all three countries, as it was seen as a way for multinational corporations to overrule local regulations.
5
North American Industry Classification System
The three NAFTA signatory countries developed a new collaborative business classification system that facilitates the comparison of business activity statistics across North America. The
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
organizes and separates industries according to their production processes.
The NAICS replaced the U.S.
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
system, allowing businesses to be classified systematically in an ever-changing economy. The new system enables easier comparability among all countries in North America. To ensure that the NAICS remains relevant, the system is reviewed every five years.
The three parties responsible for the formation and continued maintenance of the NAICS are:
The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía in Mexico
Statistics Canada
The U.S.
Office of Management and Budget
through its Economic Classification Policy Committee, which also includes the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Census Bureau
The first version of the classification system was released in 1997. A revision in 2002 reflected the substantial changes occurring in the information sector. The 2022 review made changes to the classification of industries by creating 111 new ones. This was done by “reclassifying, combining, or splitting 156 NAICS 2017 industries or their parts.”
6
Note
NAICS is reviewed every five years in years ending in “2” and “7.” The next scheduled review is set for 2027.
7
This classification system allows for more flexibility than the SIC’s four-digit structure by implementing a hierarchical six-digit coding system and classifying all economic activity into 20 industry sectors.
Five of these sectors are primarily those that produce goods, and the remaining 15 sectors provide some type of service. Every company receives a primary NAICS code that indicates its main line of business. A company receives its primary code based on the code definition that generates the largest portion of the company’s
revenue

A joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement by which two or more parties pool resources for a project while sharing profits, losses, and responsibilities within a separate entity.
What Is a Joint Venture (JV)?
A joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task. This task can be a new project or any other business activity.
Each of the participants in a joint venture is responsible for
profits
, losses, and costs associated with it. However, the venture is its own entity, separate from the participants’ other business interests.
Key Takeaways
In a joint venture (JV), two or more businesses decide to combine their resources in order to fulfill an enumerated goal.
They are a partnership in the colloquial sense of the word but can take on any legal structure.
A common use of JVs is to partner up with a local business to enter a foreign market.
Sydney Burns / Investopedia
Understanding a Joint Venture (JV)
Although a joint venture is a partnership in the colloquial sense of the word, it can be formed using any legal structure—corporations, partnerships,
limited liability companies (LLCs)
, and other business entities can all be employed.
Despite the fact that the purpose of a JV is typically for production or research, one can also be formed for a continuing purpose. JVs can combine large and small companies to take on one or several projects and deals.
Here are the four main reasons why companies form JVs.
1. To Leverage Resources
A joint venture can take advantage of the combined resources of both companies to achieve the goal of the venture. One company might have a well-established manufacturing process, while the other company might have superior distribution channels.
2. To Reduce Costs
By using
economies of scale
, both companies in the joint venture can leverage their production at a lower per-unit cost than they would separately. This is particularly appropriate with technological advances that are costly to implement. Other cost savings as a result of a JV can include
sharing advertising, business supply, or labor costs
.
3. To Combine Expertise
Two companies or parties forming a joint venture might each have different backgrounds, skill sets, or expertise. When these are combined through a JV, each company can benefit from the other’s talent.
4. To Enter Foreign Markets
Another common use of joint ventures is to partner with a local business to enter a foreign market. A company that wants to expand its
distribution network
to new countries can enter into a JV agreement to supply products to a local business, thus benefiting from an already-existing distribution network.
Some countries have restrictions on foreigners entering their market, making a JV with a local entity almost the only way to do business in the country.

How to Set Up a Joint Venture
Regardless of the joint venture structure, the most important document will be the agreement that sets out all of the rights and obligations of each party to the venture.
The objectives, the initial contributions of the parties, the day-to-day operations, the right to the profits, and the responsibility for losses are all set out in the JV agreement. It is important to draft it with care to avoid
risking litigation
down the road.
Advantages and Disadvantages of a Joint Venture
Advantages
A joint venture gives each party the opportunity to exploit a new business opportunity without bearing all of the cost and risk. Joint ventures, by nature, are riskier than “business as usual,” and
coopetition and sharing the risk
is a wise move.
If the right participants are involved, the joint venture also starts out with a broader base of knowledge and pool of talent than any one party possesses on its own.
For example, a joint entertainment venture set up by an animation studio and a streaming content provider can get off the ground quicker—and probably with a better chance of success—than either participant could alone.
Disadvantages
Embarking on a joint venture requires relinquishing a degree of control. The vital decisions are being made by two or more parties.
The companies involved must go into the project with the same goals and an equal degree of commitment.
Extreme differences between the participants’ company cultures and management styles can be a barrier to success. Will the executives of an animation studio be able to communicate in the same language as the executives of a digital streaming giant? They might, or they might line up in opposing camps.
Setting up a joint venture multiplies the number of management teams involved. If one party undergoes a significant change in its business structure or executive team, the joint venture can get lost in the shuffle.
Paying Taxes on a Joint Venture
When forming a joint venture, the most common thing the two parties can do is to set up a new entity. As the JV itself isn’t recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the business form between the two parties helps determine how taxes are paid.
As the JV is a separate entity, it will pay taxes as any other business or corporation does. However, if it chooses to operate as an LLC, its profits and losses would pass through to the owners’ personal tax returns, as with any other LLC.
1
The JV agreement will spell out how profits or losses are taxed. If the agreement is merely a contractual relationship between the two parties, then it will determine how the tax is divided between them.
Joint Ventures vs. Partnerships and Consortiums
A joint venture is not a partnership. That term is reserved for a single business entity that is formed by two or more people. JVs join two or more different entities into a new one, which may or may not be a partnership.
The term “
consortium
” is sometimes used to describe a JV, and there are similarities. However, a consortium is a more informal agreement than a JV. For example, a consortium of travel agencies can negotiate and give members special rates on hotels and airfares, but it does not create a whole new entity.
The agencies still pursue their own businesses independently. In a JV, they would share ownership of the created entity, jointly responsible for its risks, profits, losses, and governance.
Example of a Joint Venture
In 2022, two large Japanese companies, Sony and Honda, announced a joint venture to create an electric vehicle. Sony is one of the world's most prominent electronics companies and Honda is one of the most prominent automobile companies.
2
The established joint venture seeks to bring an electric vehicle to market by 2026 by combining Honda's skills in mobility development, technology, and sales, with that of Sony's expertise in imaging, telecommunication, networks, and entertainment.
2
3
The joint venture is called ""Afeela."" The company will be taking pre-orders in 2025 with expected delivery in the U.S. in 2026.

Why Would a Firm Enter Into a Joint Venture?
There are many reasons to
join forces with another company
on a temporary basis, including for purposes of expansion, development of new products, and entering new markets (particularly overseas).
Joint ventures are a common method of combining the business prowess, industry expertise, and personnel of two otherwise unrelated companies. This type of partnership allows each participating company an opportunity to scale its resources to complete a specific project or goal while reducing total cost and spreading out the risks and liabilities inherent to the task.
What Are the Primary Advantages of Forming a Joint Venture?
A joint venture affords each party access to the resources of the other participant(s) without having to spend excessive amounts of capital. Each company is able to maintain its own identity and can easily return to normal business operations once the JV is complete. JVs also provide the benefit of shared risk.
What Are Some Disadvantages of Forming a Joint Venture?
Joint venture contracts commonly limit the outside activities of participant companies while the project is in progress. Each company involved in a JV may be required to sign exclusivity agreements or a
non-compete agreement
that affects current relationships with
vendors
or other business contacts.
The contract under which a JV is created may also expose each company to liability inherent to a partnership unless a separate business entity is established for the JV. Furthermore, while companies participating in a JV share control, work activities and use of resources are not always divided equally.

What Is the High-Low Method?
In

total costs at each level
.
If the variable cost is a fixed charge per unit and fixed costs remain the same, it is possible to determine the fixed and variable costs by solving the system of equations. It is worth being cautious when using the high-low method, however, as it can yield more or less accurate results depending on the distribution of values between the highest and lowest dollar amounts or quantities.
Key Takeaways
The high-low method is a simple way to segregate costs with minimal information.
The simplicity of the approach assumes the variable and fixed costs as constant, which doesn’t replicate reality.
Other cost-estimating methods, such as least-squares regression, might provide better results, although this method requires more complex calculations.
Understanding the High-Low Method
Calculating the outcome for the high-low method requires a few formula steps. First, you must calculate the variable-cost component and then the fixed-cost component, and then plug the results into the cost model formula.
First, determine the variable-cost component:
Variable Cost
=
HAC
−
Lowest Activity Cost
HAUs
−
Lowest Activity Units
where:
HAC
=
Highest activity cost
HAUs
=
Highest activity units
Variable cost is per unit
\begin{aligned} &\text{Variable Cost} = \frac { \text{HAC} - \text{Lowest Activity Cost} }{ \text{HAUs} - \text{Lowest Activity Units} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{HAC} = \text{Highest activity cost} \\ &\text{HAUs} = \text{Highest activity units} \\ &\text{Variable cost is per unit} \\ \end{aligned}
​
Variable Cost
=
HAUs
−
Lowest Activity Units
HAC
−
Lowest Activity Cost
​
where:
HAC
=
Highest activity cost
HAUs
=
Highest activity units
Variable cost is per unit
​
Next, use the following formula to determine the fixed-cost component:
Fixed Cost
=
HAC
−
(
Variable Cost
×
HAUs
)
\begin{aligned} &\text{Fixed Cost} = \text{HAC} - ( \text{Variable Cost} \times \text{HAUs} ) \\ \end{aligned}
​
Fixed Cost
=
HAC
−
(
Variable Cost
×
HAUs
)
​
Use the results of the first two formulas to calculate the high-low cost result using the following formula:
High-Low Cost
=
Fixed Cost
+
(
Variable Cost
×
UA
)
where:
UA
=
Unit activity
\begin{aligned} &\text{High-Low Cost} = \text{Fixed Cost} + ( \text{Variable Cost} \times \text{UA} ) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{UA} = \text{Unit activity} \\ \end{aligned}
​
High-Low Cost
=
Fixed Cost
+
(
Variable Cost
×
UA
)
where:
UA
=
Unit activity
​
What the High-Low Method Tells You
The costs associated with a product, product line, equipment, store, geographic sales region, or subsidiary consist of both
variable costs
and
fixed costs
. To determine both cost components of the total cost, an analyst or accountant can use a technique known as the high-low method.
The high-low method is used to calculate the variable and fixed costs of a product or entity with mixed costs. It takes two factors into consideration. It considers the total dollars of the mixed costs at the highest volume of activity and the total dollars of the
mixed costs
at the lowest volume of activity. The total amount of fixed costs is assumed to be the same at both points of activity. The change in the total costs is thus the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity.
Example of How to Use the High-Low Method
For example, the table below depicts the activity for a cake bakery for each of the 12 months of a given year.
Below is an example of the high-low method of cost accounting:
Month
Cakes Baked (units)
Total Cost ($)
January
115
$5,000
February
80
$4,250
March
90
$4,650
April
95
$4,600
May
75
$3,675
June
100
$5,000
July
85
$4,400
August
70
$3,750
September
115
$5,100
October
125
$5,550
November
110
$5,100
December
120
$5,700
The highest activity for the bakery occurred in October, when it baked the highest number of cakes, while August had the lowest activity level, with only 70 cakes baked at a cost of $3,750. The cost amounts adjacent to these activity levels will be used in the high-low method, even though these cost amounts are not necessarily the highest and lowest costs for the year.
We calculate the fixed and variable costs using the following steps:
1. Calculate variable cost per unit using identified high and low activity levels

The Difference Between the High-Low Method and Regression Analysis
The high-low method is a simple analysis that takes less calculation work. It only requires the high and low points of the data and can be worked through with a simple calculator. It also gives analysts a way to estimate future unit costs.
However, the formula does not take inflation into consideration and provides a very rough estimation because it only considers the extreme high and low values, and excludes the influence of any outliers.
Regression analysis
helps forecast costs as well, by comparing the influence of one predictive variable upon another value or criteria.
1
It also considers outlying values that help refine the results. However, regression analysis is only as good as the set of data points used, and the results suffer when the data set is incomplete.
It’s also possible to draw incorrect conclusions by assuming that just because two sets of data
correlate
with each other, one must cause changes in the other. Regression analysis is also best performed using a spreadsheet program or
statistics
program.
Limitations of the High-Low Method
The high-low method is relatively unreliable because it only takes two extreme activity levels into consideration. The high or low points used for the calculation may not be representative of the costs normally incurred at those volume levels due to outlier costs that are higher or lower than would normally be incurred. In this case, the high-low method will produce inaccurate results.
The high-low method is generally not preferred, as it can yield an incorrect understanding of the data if there are changes in variable- or fixed-cost rates over time or if a tiered pricing system is employed. In most real-world cases, it should be possible to obtain more information so the variable and fixed costs can be determined directly. Thus, the high-low method should only be used when it is not possible to obtain actual
billing
data.
How Is the High-Low Method Used?
The high-low method is used to calculate the variable and fixed costs of a product or entity with mixed costs. It considers the total dollars of the mixed costs at the highest volume of activity and the total dollars of the mixed costs at the lowest volume of activity.
Why Is the High-Low Method a Simple Analysis?
Because it takes less calculation work. The high-low method only requires the high and low points of the data and can be worked through with a calculator.
Why Is the High-Low Method Considered Unreliable?
Because it only considers two extreme activity levels. The high or low points used for the calculation may not represent the costs normally incurred at those volume levels due to outlier costs that are higher or lower than would normally be incurred. The high-low method will then produce inaccurate results.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-low-method.asp

Definition
Terminal value is the estimated value of a business or other asset beyond the cash flow forecast period and into perpetuity.
What Is Terminal Value (TV)?
Terminal value (TV) is the value of a company beyond the period for which future cash flows can be estimated. Terminal value assumes that the business will grow at a set rate forever after the forecast period, which is typically five years or less.
Terminal value often makes up a large percentage of the total assessed value of a business.
Terminal value also can be used to value an asset or a project.
Key Takeaways
Cash flow forecasts become murkier as the time horizon lengthens.
To estimate value beyond the forecasting period of three to five years, analysts determine a terminal value using one of two methods.
The perpetual growth method, also known as the Gordon Growth Model, assumes that a business will generate cash flows at a constant rate in perpetuity.
The exit multiple method assumes that a business will be sold.
Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi
Understanding Terminal Value
Forecasting becomes murkier as the time horizon grows longer, especially when it comes to estimating a company's cash flows well into the future. Businesses must still be valued, however.
Analysts use financial models to solve this, such as discounted cash flow (DCF), as well as certain assumptions to derive the total value of a business or project. Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a popular method used in feasibility studies,
corporate acquisitions
, and stock market valuation.

This method is based on the theory that an asset's value equals all future cash flows derived from that asset. These cash flows must be discounted to the
present value
at a discount rate representing the cost of capital, such as the interest rate.
DCF has two major components: forecast period and terminal value. Analysts use a forecast period of about three to five years. The accuracy of the projections suffers when using a period longer than that. This is where calculating terminal value becomes important. This period is often longer for certain industries, however, such as those involved in natural resource extraction.
Two
commonly used methods
to calculate terminal value are perpetual growth (Gordon Growth Model) and exit multiple. The former assumes that a business will
continue to generate cash flows
at a constant rate forever. The latter assumes that a business will be sold for a multiple of some market metric.
1
Investment professionals prefer the exit multiple approach. Academics favor the perpetual growth model.
How Is Terminal Value Estimated?
Terminal value can be determined using several formulas. Most terminal value formulas project future cash flows to return the present value of a future asset like discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.
The liquidation value model or exit method requires figuring out the asset's earning power with an appropriate discount rate and then adjusting for the estimated value of outstanding debt.
The stable or perpetuity growth model doesn't assume the company will be liquidated after the terminal year. It instead assumes that cash flows are
reinvested
and that the firm can grow at a constant rate into perpetuity.
The
multiples approach
uses the approximate sales revenues of a company during the last year of a discounted cash flow model and then uses a multiple of that figure to arrive at the terminal value without further discounting applied.
Fast Fact
The Gordon Growth Model is named after Myron Gordon, an economist at the University of Toronto, who worked out the basic formula in the late 1950s.
2
Types of Terminal Value
Perpetuity Method
Discounting is necessary because the time value of money creates a discrepancy between the current and future values of a given sum of money.
Free cash flow
or dividends can be forecast in business valuation for a discrete period but the performance of ongoing concerns becomes more challenging to estimate as the projections stretch further into the future. It's also difficult to determine when a company might cease operations.
Investors can assume that cash flows will grow at a stable rate forever to overcome these limitations starting at some future point. This represents the terminal value.
Terminal value is calculated by dividing the last cash flow forecast by the difference between the discount and terminal growth rates. The terminal value calculation estimates the company's value after the forecast period.
3
Assuming that cash flows will grow at a constant rate forever, the formula to calculate a firm's terminal value is:
FCF / (d – g)
Where:
FCF = free cash flow for the last forecast period
g = terminal growth rate
d = discount rate (which is usually the
weighted average cost of capital
The terminal growth rate is the constant rate at which a company is expected to grow forever. This growth rate starts at the end of the last forecasted cash flow period in a discounted cash flow model and goes into perpetuity.
A terminal growth rate is usually in line with the long-term inflation rate but not higher than the historical gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate.
Exit Multiple Method
There's no need to use the perpetuity growth model if investors assume a finite window of operations. The terminal value must instead reflect the net realizable value of a company's assets at that time. This often implies that the equity will be acquired by a larger firm and the value of acquisitions is often calculated with exit multiples.
Exit multiples estimate a fair price by multiplying financial statistics by a factor that's common for recently acquired and similar firms. Statistics include sales, profits, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).
3
The terminal value formula using the exit multiple method is the most recent metric such as sales and EBITDA multiplied by the decided-upon multiple which is usually an average of recent exit multiples for other transactions.
Investment banks often employ this valuation method but some detractors hesitate to use intrinsic and relative valuation techniques simultaneously.
Important
Terminal value accounts for a significant portion of the total value of a business in a DCF model because it represents the value of all future cash flows beyond the projection period. The assumptions made about terminal value can significantly impact the overall valuation of a business.
Terminal Value vs. Net Present Value
Terminal value isn't the same as net present value (NPV). Terminal value is a financial concept used in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and depreciation to account for the value of an asset at the end of its useful life or of a business that's past some projection period.
Net present value (NPV)
measures the profitability of an investment or project. It's calculated by discounting all future cash flows of the investment or project to the present value using a discount rate and then subtracting the initial investment.
NPV is used to determine whether an investment or project is expected to generate positive returns or losses. It's a commonly used tool in financial decision-making because it helps to evaluate the attractiveness of an investment or project by considering the time value of money.
Why Do We Need to Know the Terminal Value of a Business or Asset?
Most companies don't assume that they'll stop operations after a few years. They expect business to continue forever or at least for a very long time. Terminal value is an attempt to anticipate a company's
future value
and apply it to present prices through discounting.
Should I Use the Perpetuity Growth Model or the Exit Approach?
Neither the perpetuity growth model nor the exit multiple approach is likely to render a perfectly accurate estimate of terminal value. The choice of which method to use to calculate terminal value depends partly on whether an investor wants to obtain a relatively more optimistic estimate or a relatively more conservative estimate.
Using the perpetuity growth model to estimate terminal value generally renders a higher value. Investors can benefit from using both terminal value calculations and then using an average of the two values arrived at for a final estimate of NPV.

Definition
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) surmises that the average of the sample means and standard deviations equals the population mean and standard deviation.
What Is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?
The Central Limit Theorem is useful when analyzing large data sets because it assumes that the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed and typically form a
bell curve
. The CLT may be used in conjunction with the
law of large numbers
, which states that the average obtained from a large group of independent random samples converges to the true value.
Key Takeaways
CLT assumes that a large sample size can successfully predict the characteristics of a population.
Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient under the Central Limit Theorem.
Investors may use CLT to study a random sample of stocks to estimate returns for a portfolio.
Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou
Understanding the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
According to the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample of data will be closer to the mean of the overall population in question as the sample size increases, notwithstanding the actual distribution of the data. The concept can hold true regardless of whether the distribution of the population is normal or skewed.
1
As a general rule, sample sizes of 30 or more are typically deemed sufficient for the CLT to hold, meaning that the distribution of the sample means is fairly normally distributed. In addition, the more samples one takes, the more the graphed results should take the shape of a normal distribution.
1
The central limit theorem is often used in conjunction with the law of large numbers, which states that the average of the sample means will come closer to equaling the population mean as the sample size grows. This concept can be extremely useful in accurately predicting the characteristics of very large populations.
Although this concept was first developed by Abraham de Moivre in 1733, it was not formalized until 1920, when the Hungarian mathematician George Pólya dubbed it the central limit theorem.

Key Components of the Central Limit Theorem
The central limit theorem has several key components. They largely revolve around sampling technique.
Sampling is successive
:
This means some sample units are common with sample units selected on previous occasions.
Sampling is random
:
All samples must be selected at random so that they have the same statistical possibility of being selected.
Samples should be independent
: The selections or results from one sample should have no bearing on future samples or other sample results.
Large sample size
: As sample size increases, the sampling distribution should come ever closer to the normal distribution.

The Central Limit Theorem in Finance and Investing
The CLT can help examine the returns of an individual stock or broader stock indices because the analysis is simple, due to the relative ease of generating the necessary financial data. Consequently, investors often rely on the CLT to analyze stock returns, construct portfolios, and manage risk.
Suppose, for example, that an investor wishes to analyze the overall return for a stock index that consists of 1,000 different equities. In this scenario, the investor may simply study a random sample of stocks to arrive at an estimated return for the total index. To be safe in this instance, at least 30 to 50 randomly selected stocks across various sectors should be sampled for the central limit theorem to hold.
Why Is the Central Limit Theorem Useful?
The central limit theorem is useful when analyzing large data sets because it allows one to assume that the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed in most cases. This allows for easier statistical analysis and inference. For example, investors can use central limit theorem to aggregate individual security performance data and generate distribution of sample means that represent a larger population distribution for security returns over some time.
What Is the Formula for Central Limit Theorem?
The central limit theorem doesn't have a formula used in its practical application. Its principle is simply applied. With a sufficiently large sample size, the sample distribution will approximate a normal distribution, and the sample mean will approach the population mean. It suggests that if we have a sample size of at least 30, we can begin to analyze the data as if it fit a normal distribution.
Why Is the Central Limit Theorem's Minimum Sample Size 30?
A sample size of 30 or more is fairly common across statistics as the minimum for applying the central limit theorem. The greater your sample size, the more likely the sample will be representative of your population set.
6
What Is the Law of Large Numbers?
In probability theory and statistics, the law of large numbers states that the larger the sample size, the more likely its mean is to reflect the mean of the entire population.
In business, the law of large numbers can have a different meaning, specifically that as a company grows in size, maintaining its rate of growth in percentage terms becomes more difficult.
The Bottom Line
The central limit theorem (CLT) holds that as a sample size gets larger, its mean will increasingly approximate the mean in a normal distribution. This concept can be useful in many applications, such as analyzing investment returns, because it requires only a sufficient sample size (generally interpreted as 30 or more data points) rather than the entire population.

Investopedia,"What Is an Offset? Definition, Example, and How It's Used","Close
What Is an Offset?
An offset is a financial market strategy that requires a trader to take an opening position and then take a directly opposite position. For example, if you are long 100 shares of XYZ, selling 100 shares of XYZ would be the offsetting position.
An offsetting position can also be generated through
hedging
instruments such as futures or
options
. In the
derivatives
markets, to offset a
futures
position a trader enters an equivalent but opposite transaction that eliminates the
delivery
obligation of the physical product that it represents.
The goal of offsetting is to reduce an investor's net position in an investment to zero so that no further gains or losses are experienced from that position.
In business, an offset refers to the generation of gains in one business unit that makes up for losses in another unit.
Key Takeaways
In accounting, an offset is the recording of a gain that nullifies the effect of the recording of a loss.
An offset in futures trading is taking two opposite positions on a commodity to cancel the delivery of the commodity.
In certain markets, an offset is used to reduce risk exposure.
How an Offset Works
Offsetting is used in several types of businesses. Its effect is to remove or limit liabilities.
In accounting, an entry can be offset by an equal but opposite entry that nullifies the original entry. For example, a loss in one division can be eliminated by an equal profit in another division.
In banking, the right to offset provides financial institutions with the ability to seize debtor assets in the case of delinquency.
For investors in the futures market, an offsetting position eliminates the need to receive physical delivery of the underlying asset or commodity by selling the associated goods to another party.
Offsetting Losses
Businesses may offset losses in one business division by reallocating gains from another. This allows the profitability of one activity to support the other activity.
For example, a business that is successful in the smartphone market may decide to produce a tablet as a new product line. The profits from smartphone sales can help offset the early losses associated with expanding into a new arena.
Similarly, companies with global sales may offset losses in one currency with gains in another. One unit may have risk exposure to a decline in the Swiss franc compared to the euro, while another may benefit from a declining franc.
Offsetting in Derivatives Contracts
Investors offset futures contracts and other investment positions to remove themselves from any associated
liabilities
. Almost all futures positions are offset before the terms of the
futures contract
are realized. Even though most positions are offset near the delivery term, the benefits of the futures contract as a hedging mechanism are still realized.
A futures contract is an agreement to purchase a particular commodity at a specific price on a future date. If a contract is held until the agreed-upon date, the investor could become responsible for accepting the physical delivery of the commodity in question.
The purpose of offsetting a futures contract on a commodity, for most investors, is to avoid having to physically receive the goods associated with the contract.
Offsetting to Reduce Risk
In the options markets, traders often look to offset certain risk exposures, sometimes referred to as their ""
Greeks
."" For instance, if an options book is exposed to declines in implied volatility (long
vega
), a trader may sell related options to offset that exposure.
Or, if an options position is exposed to directional risk, a trader may buy or sell the underlying security to become
delta neutral
. Dynamic hedging (or
delta-gamma hedging
) is a strategy employed by derivatives traders to maintain offsetting positions on an ongoing basis.
Why Would I Take an Offset Position?
One definition of the word offset is ""something that serves to counterbalance or to compensate for something else."" In all of the businesses in which offsets are used, they are employed to eliminate a loss or some other downside risk inherent in a previous decision.
1
What Does It Mean to Offset a Payment?
An offset in a payment is a reduction in the total amount owed. It occurs when one party successfully argues that the amount due should be reduced due to some compensation owed to the payer.
What Is a Tax Refund Offset?
If your tax refund is offset, the federal government has seized a portion of your refund to put towards a state or federal debt you owe. Unpaid child support is an example.
2
The Bottom Line
If the initial investment was a purchase, a sale in the same amount is made to neutralize the position. To offset an initial sale, a purchase is made to neutralize the position.
With futures related to stocks, investors may use hedging to assume an opposing position to manage the risk associated with the futures contract. For example, if you wanted to offset a
long position
in a stock, you could short-sell an identical number of shares.

What Is a Housing Bubble?
A housing or real estate bubble is a run-up in housing prices fueled by demand, speculation, and exuberant spending. Housing bubbles usually start with increased demand in the face of limited supply.
Speculators
further drive up demand by investing money into the market. When demand decreases or stagnates as supply increases, prices drop, and the bubble bursts.
Key Takeaways
A housing bubble is a sustained but temporary condition of over-valued prices and rampant speculation in housing markets.
The U.S. experienced a major housing bubble in the 2000s caused by money inflows to housing markets and loose lending conditions.
Homeowners may force foreclosure once the value of the home plummets and the mortgage exceeds the equity.
What Causes a Housing Bubble?
A housing bubble may be driven by something outside the norm, such as manipulated demand, speculation, unusually high levels of investment, excess liquidity, a deregulated real estate financing market, or extreme forms of
mortgage-based derivative
products.
These factors can cause home prices to become unsustainable, leading to an increase in demand versus supply. Housing markets aren't as prone to bubbles as other financial markets due to the large transaction and carrying costs associated with owning a house.
However, a rapid increase in the supply of credit leading to a combination of low-interest rates and a loosening of underwriting standards can bring borrowers into the market. A rise in interest rates and a tightening of credit standards can lessen demand, causing the housing bubble to burst.
Effects of a Housing Bubble
Housing bubbles affect communities and the overall economy. They can force homeowners to look for ways to pay off mortgages through various programs or they may have them digging into
retirement accounts
to afford to continue living in their homes. A housing bubble can significantly cut into the
equity
in a home and homeowners often find that their mortgage balance is more than the value.
Homeowners may force
foreclosure
once the value of the home plummets and the mortgage exceeds the equity. Foreclosure occurs when a lender attempts to recover the amount owed on a
defaulted loan
by taking ownership of the mortgaged property and selling it. Typically, default is triggered when a borrower misses monthly payments or fails to meet other terms in the mortgage document.
Warning
""Negative equity"" occurs when homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. These mortgages are considered “underwater” or “upside down,” affecting an individual's net worth and preventing homeowners from relocating until the market improves.
1
Housing Bubble Example
A U.S. housing bubble occurred following the
financial crisis of 2007-2008
. Following the
dot-com bubble
bursting in the 1990s, investors moved their money from start-up technology company stocks into real estate. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to combat the mild recession that followed the technology bust and to assuage uncertainty following the World Trade Center attack of Sept. 11, 2001.
2
Government policies encouraged homeownership and financial market innovations increased the liquidity of real estate-related assets. Home prices rose as interest rates plummeted. It's estimated that 20% of mortgages in 2005 and 2006 went to buyers, known as subprime borrowers, who would not have been able to qualify under normal lending requirements.
3
Over 75% of these subprime loans were
adjustable-rate
mortgages with low initial rates and scheduled resets after two to three years.
4
The government’s encouragement of broad homeownership induced banks to lower their rates and lending requirements.
5
This spurred a home-buying frenzy that drove the median sales price of homes up by 55% from 2000 to 2007.
6
Adjustable rate mortgages began resetting at higher rates in 2007 as signs that the economy was slowing. Housing prices declined 19% from 2007 to 2009,
triggering a massive sell-off
in mortgage-backed securities.
6
Important
In 2023, the number of foreclosure filings in the United States was 357,062. In 2009 and 2010, during the housing bubble, foreclosures totaled over 2.8 million for each year.
7
What Is a Speculator in Real Estate?
A speculator buys properties because they have reason to believe that the market or some factor in the economy will increase in value, sometimes in a short period. The goal is to ""flip"" the property and sell it as soon as this occurs, reaping a profit. Unlike a speculator, an investor anticipates more of a long-term profit due to factors other than or in addition to market volatility.
8
What Is an Adjustable Rate Mortgage?
The interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) can go up and down over time affecting a homebuyer's mortgage payment and causing it to increase or decrease periodically. Most ARMs have rate caps and other controls to prevent frequent, dramatic, and painful swings. The advantage of this type of mortgage is that the interest rate is typically less than that of a fixed-rate mortgage in the early years of the loan.
9
What Is the Foreclosure Process?
Foreclosure rules can vary from state to state, but it's typically initiated because the homeowner has stopped making mortgage payments. The mortgage contract gives the lender a secured interest in the property, This provides the lender with a legal right to seize the property after giving proper notice to the homeowner and allowing them to cure the default. The lender will then sell the property to recoup some, if not all, of the money it loaned so the homeowner could initially buy the property.
10
The Bottom Line
A housing bubble can significantly affect a home's value and the equity in real estate. As prices climb, investors may flood the market, and home buyers may secure risky loans. When the bubble bursts, prices plummet and some borrowers may face financial stress or foreclosure.

Definition
Preference shares or preferred stock are a class of stock that receive dividends before common stock.
What Are Preference Shares?
Preference shares, more commonly referred to as
preferred stock
, are shares of a company’s stock with dividends that are paid out to shareholders before common stock dividends are issued. If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders.
Most preference shares
have a fixed dividend
, while common stocks generally do not. Preferred stock shareholders also typically do not hold any voting rights, but common shareholders usually do.
Key Takeaways
Preference shares (preferred stock) are company stock with dividends that are paid to shareholders before common stock dividends are paid out.
There are four types of preferred stock - cumulative (guaranteed), non-cumulative, participating and convertible.
Preference shares are ideal for risk-averse investors and they are callable (the issuer can redeem them at any time).
Investopedia / Jessica Olah
Understanding Preference Shares
Preference shares fall under four categories: cumulative preferred stock, non-cumulative preferred stock, participating preferred stock and convertible preferred stock.
1
Cumulative preferred stock
includes a provision that requires the company to pay shareholders all dividends, including those that were omitted in the past, before the common shareholders are able to receive their dividend payments. These dividend payments are guaranteed but not always paid out when they are due. Unpaid dividends are assigned the moniker ""dividends in arrears"" and must legally go to the current owner of the stock at the time of payment. At times additional compensation (interest) is awarded to the holder of this type of preferred stock.
Quarterly Dividend = [(Dividend Rate) x (Par Value)] ÷ 4
Cumulative Dividends per share = Quarterly Dividend x Number of Missed Payments
Non-cumulative preferred stock does not issue any omitted or unpaid dividends. If the company chooses not to pay dividends in any given year, the shareholders of the non-cumulative preferred stock have no right or power to claim such forgone dividends at any time in the future.
Participating preferred stock
provides its shareholders with the right to be paid dividends in an amount equal to the generally specified rate of preferred dividends, plus an additional dividend based on a predetermined condition. This additional dividend is typically designed to be paid out only if the amount of dividends received by common shareholders is greater than a predetermined per-share amount. If the company is liquidated, participating preferred shareholders may also have the right to be paid back the purchasing price of the stock as well as a pro-rata share of remaining proceeds received by common shareholders.
Convertible preferred stock includes an option that allows shareholders to convert their preferred shares into a set number of common shares, generally any time after a pre-established date. Under normal circumstances, convertible preferred shares are exchanged in this way at the shareholder's request. However, a company may have a provision on such shares that allows the shareholders or the issuer to force the issue. How valuable convertible common stocks are is based, ultimately, on how well the
common stock
performs.
What are preference shares?
Preference shares, also known as
preferred shares
, are a type of security that offers characteristics similar to both
common shares
and a
fixed-income security
. The holders of preference shares are typically given priority when it comes to any dividends that the company pays. In exchange, preference shares often do not enjoy the same level of voting rights or upside participation as common shares.
What are the main types of preference shares?
There are four main types of preference shares: cumulative preferred, non-cumulative preferred, participating preferred, and convertible. Holders of cumulative preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends retroactively for any dividends that were not paid in prior periods, whereas non-cumulative preferred shares do not carry this provision. For this reason, cumulative preferred shares will generally be more expensive than non-cumulative preferreds. Similarly, participating preferred shares offer the benefit of additional dividends if certain performance targets are reached, such as company profits exceeding a specified level. Convertible preferreds, like
convertible bonds
, allow the holder to convert their preference shares into common shares at a specified
exercise price
.
What happens if you own preference shares in a company that goes bankrupt?
If a company goes bankrupt, then the different securityholders in that company will have claim to the company’s assets. The order in which those securityholders receive their share of the assets will depend on the specific rights given to them in their security agreements. Preference shares, for instance, will generally have
priority over the common shares
, and will therefore be paid before the common shareholders. However, preference shares will generally have lower priority than
corporate bonds
,
debentures
, or other fixed-income securities.

Definition
Economies of scale are cost advantages companies gain through efficient, increased production.
What Are Economies of Scale?
Economies of scale represent the potential benefits of having a larger operation. In theory, larger operations are able to increase production, buy higher quantities of goods in bulk, and rely on process efficiencies. When these benefits are captured, it is said that a company is capitalizing on economies of scale as it is accomplishing more efficient use of resources due to its size.
Key Takeaways
Economies of scale are cost savings that companies experience when production becomes efficient, often by being larger.
This occurs when production rises at a rate faster than costs, with costs then being spread over a larger amount of goods.
A business's size is related to whether it can achieve an economy of scale—larger companies will have more cost savings and higher production levels.
Economies of scale can be both internal and external; internal economies are caused by factors within a single company, while external factors affect the entire industry.
Investopedia / Mira Norian
Understanding Economies of Scale
The size of the business generally matters when it comes to economies of scale. The larger the business, the greater its
cost savings
. Economies of scale can be both internal and external. Internal economies of scale are based on management decisions, while external ones have to do with outside factors.
Internal functions include accounting, information technology, and marketing, which are also considered operational efficiencies and synergies.
Economies of scale are an important concept for any business in any industry and represent the cost-savings and competitive advantages larger businesses have over smaller ones.
Most consumers don't understand why a smaller business charges more for a similar product sold by a larger company. That's because the cost per unit depends on how much the company produces.
Important
A company can create a diseconomy of scale when it becomes too large and chases an economy of scale.
Larger companies can produce more by spreading the cost of production over a larger amount of goods. An industry may also be able to dictate the cost of a product if several different companies are producing similar goods within that industry.
There are several reasons why economies of scale give rise to
lower per-unit costs
. First, specialization of
labor
and more integrated technology boost production volumes.
Second, lower per-unit costs can come from bulk orders from suppliers, larger advertising buys, or lower
costs of capital
. Third, spreading internal function costs across more units produced and sold helps to reduce costs.
Internal vs. External Economies of Scale
As mentioned above, there are two different
types of economies of scale
.
Internal economies of scale
: Originate within the company, due to changes in how that company functions or produces goods
External economies of scale
: Based on factors that affect the entire industry, rather than a single company
Internal Economies of Scale
Internal economies of scale happen when a company cuts costs internally, so they're unique to that particular firm. This may be the result of the sheer size of a company or because of decisions from the firm's management. There are different kinds of internal economies of scale. These include:
Technical
: large-scale machines or production processes that increase productivity
Purchasing
: discounts on cost due to purchasing in bulk
Managerial
: employing specialists to oversee and improve different parts of the production process
Risk-Bearing
: spreading risks out across multiple investors
Financial
: higher creditworthiness, which increases access to capital and more favorable interest rates
Marketing
: more advertising power spread out across a larger market, as well as a position in the market to negotiate
Larger companies are often able to achieve internal economies of scale—lowering their costs and raising their production levels—because they can, for example, buy resources in bulk, have a patent or special technology, or access more capital.
External Economies of Scale
External economies of scale, on the other hand, are achieved because of external factors, or factors that affect an entire industry. That means no one company
controls costs
on its own. These occur when there is a highly skilled labor pool, subsidies and/or tax reductions, and partnerships and joint ventures—anything that can cut down on costs to many companies in a specific industry.
Overcoming Limits
Management techniques and technology have been focusing on overcoming the limits to economies of scale for decades.
Set-up costs are lower due to more flexible technology. Equipment is priced more closely to match production capacity, enabling smaller producers such as steel mini-mills and craft brewers to compete more easily.
Outsourcing functional services makes costs more similar across businesses of various sizes. These functional services include accounting, human resources, marketing, treasury, legal, and information technology.
Micro-manufacturing, hyper-local manufacturing, and additive manufacturing (
3D printing
) can lower both set-up and production costs. Global trade and logistics have contributed to lower costs, regardless of the size of an individual plant.
According to the International Monetary Fund, the prices of both capital goods and the cost of machinery and equipment have been falling in emerging, developed, and even industrial countries for the past three decades.
1
Examples of Economies of Scale
Job shops produce products in groups such as shirts with your company logo. A significant element of the cost is the setup. In job shops, larger production runs lower unit costs because the set-up costs of designing the logo and creating the silk-screen pattern are spread across more shirts. In an assembly factory, per-unit costs are reduced by more seamless technology with robots.
A
restaurant kitchen
is often used to illustrate how economies of scale are limited: more cooks in a small space get in each other's way. In economics charts, this has been illustrated with some flavor of a U-shaped curve, in which the average cost per unit falls and then rises. Costs rising as production volume grows is termed ""diseconomies of scale.""
Diseconomies of Scale
Diseconomies stem from inefficient managerial or labor policies or over-hiring. The diseconomies may also be external, like a deteriorating transportation network.
Furthermore, as a company's scope increases, it may have to distribute its goods and services in more dispersed areas. This can increase average costs, resulting in diseconomies of scale.
Some efficiencies and inefficiencies are location-specific. If a company has many plants throughout the country, they all can benefit from costly inputs such as advertising. However, efficiencies and inefficiencies can stem from a particular location, such as a good or bad climate for farming.
Explain Like I'm Five
Economies of scale are cost benefits that come with producing goods in larger numbers. When a factory ramps up production, it can reduce its per-unit costs by introducing more advanced machinery, hiring specialized employees, or negotiating discounts on raw supplies by ordering in bulk. These improvements can be passed on to consumers through lower prices.
Economies of scale are key to understanding the advantages of industrialization and manufacturing. Mass production allows goods to be produced at lower prices, and those cost savings produce ripple effects that can impact the wider economy.
How Will I Use This in Real Life?
Economies of scale are key to understanding the benefits of specialization and division of labor. In any profession, an employee can be more effective by mastering a single, specialized task than they would be in trying to learn a wider variety of skills.
For example, suppose you get a job as a cook in a restaurant. Instead of learning every recipe, the manager would probably have you focus on a specific workstation, such as desserts, salads, fish, etc. The repetition of specific tasks would allow you to master those skills quickly, thereby making the restaurant more productive.
Fast food restaurants take this principle to extremes, producing identical (or nearly identical) items across dozens of restaurants. By serving thousands of identical meals across their locations, fast food restaurants can realize economies of scale that allow them to produce lower-cost meal items.

Operations management employs and prioritizes business practices in an organization to achieve maximum efficiency. Operations managers coordinate the activities of all departments within a company to optimize efficiency from production to end-product distribution.
What Is Operations Management?
Operations management (OM) plans, organizes, and revises business practices to achieve maximum efficiency and profitability. Operations managers oversee multiple departments in a company to help them coordinate with one another to work toward the company’s goals.
Operations management teams balance costs with
revenue
to achieve the highest possible net
operating profit
.
Key Takeaways

What Operations Managers Do
Operations managers coordinate new processes while reevaluating current structures. Organization and
productivity
are two key drivers, and the work often requires versatility and innovation. They may determine the size of manufacturing plants or implement the structure of information technology networks.
Operations managers may oversee inventory management processes,
work-in-process
levels,
raw materials
acquisition,
quality control
, materials handling, and maintenance policies. As part of their daily responsibilities, operations managers must possess a variety of skill sets, including:
1
Technical expertise
in production automation, data entry, budget tracking, and design
Organizational ability
to track project files, employee reports, budgets, schedules, and other details related to company processes
Motivational prowess
in the form of strong leadership skills that provide the expertise to motivate others, inspire ideas, and foster a supportive and diverse team
Analytical aptitude
, including risk analysis and mitigation when initiating new projects. Operations managers must analyze processes to identify challenges and offer solutions.
Decision-making proficiency
, especially under stress, when there is very little time to assess all factors
Maintain quality standards
, including raw materials, machinery, manufacturing procedures, packaging, delivery processes, and the finished product.
Important
The daily activities of a company to produce and sell a product and generate revenue are its
operating activities
.
Operations Management Tools
Business Process Reengineering (BPR)
: Focused on analyzing and designing
workflow
and business processes within a company. BPR seeks to optimize processes and eliminate redundancies.
BPR
(also known as business process redesign) helps companies dramatically restructure the organization by designing the business process from the ground up.
2
Six Sigma
: Introduced by Bill Smith at Motorola in 1986 to improve manufacturing quality. The term “six” references the control limits at six
standard deviations
from the normal distribution mean. Tools used within the
Six Sigma
process include trending charts, potential defect calculations, and other ratios.
3
Lean Manufacturing
: Aims to reduce waste and improve continuity in
supply chain
management. Lean manufacturing targets the flow of products from the production stage to customer delivery.
4
Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSCM)
A critical function of operations management relates to
inventory
flow through the supply chain.
5
This process is known as operations and supply chain management (OSCM). Operations management professionals understand
logistics
, global trends, customer demand, and available resources for production.
Operations management approaches the acquisition of materials and the use of labor in a timely, cost-effective manner to deliver customer expectations. Inventory levels are monitored to ensure that ample quantities are on hand. Operations managers find vendors that supply the appropriate goods at reasonable prices and that deliver the product when needed.
Operations managers use numerous formulas, such as the
economic order quantity
formula, to determine how large an inventory order to process and how much inventory to hold on hand. Managers may follow up with customers to ensure products meet quality and functionality needs. Operations managers take feedback and distribute relevant information to each department for improvement.
What Is the Purpose of Operations Management?
Operations management (OM) evaluates the production process and business operations and creates an efficient outcome. OM professionals balance operating costs with revenue to maximize net operating profit.
What Education Is Required to Become an Operations Manager?
Operations managers usually possess a bachelor’s degree in a business field. A
master of business administration (MBA)
degree in operations management can provide a global perspective on industry trends and an awareness of financial regulations and political uncertainties that can affect an organization. It also provides a solid grasp of the inherent complexities and the tools needed to respond effectively to change.
6
What Is the Difference Between an Operations Manager and a Project Manager?
An operations manager coordinates the activities of all of the departments in a company to ensure the company is running smoothly and efficiently. A
project manager
plans and executes projects with a firm start and end time. They usually coordinate the input of various employees working on the project.
7
The Bottom Line
Operations management (OM) is the process of
prioritizing and employing business practices
to achieve maximum efficiency. Operations managers balance the efficient use of resources, including staff, materials, equipment, and technology.

Investopedia,Credit Default Swap: What It Is and How It Works,"Close
What Is a Credit Default Swap (CDS)?
A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative that allows an investor to swap or offset their
credit risk
with that of another investor. To swap the risk of default, the lender buys a CDS from another investor who agrees to reimburse them if the borrower defaults.
Most CDS contracts are maintained via an ongoing
premium
payment similar to the regular premiums due on an insurance policy. A lender who is worried about a borrower
defaulting
on a loan often uses a CDS to offset or swap that risk.
What Does CDS Stand for?
The acronym can stand for a lot of things, but in financial derivatives, CDS stands for credit default swap. It allows an investor to swap or offset their credit risk with that of another investor.
Key Takeaways
A credit default swap (CDS) is a type of derivative that transfers the credit exposure of fixed-income products.
In a credit default swap contract, the buyer pays an ongoing premium similar to the payments on an insurance policy. In exchange, the seller agrees to pay the security’s value and interest payments if a default occurs.
1
In 2023, the estimated size of the U.S. CDS market was over $4.3 trillion.
2
Credit default swaps can be used for speculation, hedging, or as a form of arbitrage.
1
Credit default swaps played a role in both the 2008 Great Recession and the 2010 European Sovereign Debt Crisis.

4
How Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) Work
A credit default swap is a
derivative
contract that transfers the
credit exposure
of fixed-income products. It may involve
bonds
or forms of securitized debt—derivatives of loans sold to investors. For example, suppose a company sells a bond with a $100 face value and a 10-year maturity to an investor. The company might agree to pay back the $100 at the end of the 10-year period with regular interest payments throughout the bond’s life.
Because the debt issuer cannot guarantee that it will be able to repay the premium, the investor assumes the risk. The debt buyer can purchase a CDS to transfer the risk to another investor, who agrees to pay them in the event the debt issuer defaults on its obligation.
1
Debt securities often have longer terms to maturity, making it harder for investors to estimate the investment risk. For instance, a mortgage can have terms of 30 years. There is no way to tell whether the borrower will be able to continue making payments that long.

That’s why these contracts are a popular way to manage risk. The CDS buyer pays the CDS seller until the contract’s
maturity date
. In return, the CDS seller agrees that it will pay the CDS buyer the security’s value as well as all interest payments that would have been paid between that time and the maturity date if there is a credit event.
1
Credit Default Swaps and Credit Events
The
credit event
is a trigger that causes the CDS buyer to settle the contract. Credit events are agreed upon when the CDS is purchased and are part of the contract. The majority of single-name CDSs are traded with the following credit events as triggers:
Reference entity default other than failure to pay
: An event where the issuing entity defaults for a reason that is not a failure to pay
Failure to pay
: The reference entity fails to make payments
Obligation acceleration
: When contract obligations are moved, such as when the issuer needs to pay debts earlier than anticipated
Repudiation
: A dispute in the contract validity
Moratorium
: A suspension of the contract until the issues that led to the suspension are resolved
Obligation restructuring
: When the underlying loans are restructured
Government intervention
: Actions taken by the government that affect the contract
5
Size of the Credit Derivatives Market
Terms of a CDS
When purchased to provide insurance on an investment, CDSs do not necessarily need to cover the investment for its lifetime. For example, imagine an investor is two years into a 10-year security and thinks that the issuer is in credit trouble. The bond owner may buy a credit default swap with a five-year term that would protect the investment until the seventh year, when the bondholder believes the risks will fade.
1
Settlement
When a credit event occurs, the contract may be settled physically, historically the most common method, or by cash. In a physical settlement, sellers receive an actual bond from the buyer. Cash settlement, though, became the more preferred method when the purpose of CDSs shifted from
hedging
tools to
speculation
. In this type of settlement, the seller is responsible for paying the buyer for losses.
6
Fast Fact
The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issues a quarterly report on credit derivatives. In a report regarding the first quarter of 2024, it placed the size of the entire credit derivative market at $4.7 trillion, $3.2 trillion of which were CDSs.
2
When Are CDSs Used?
As an
insurance
policy against a credit event on an underlying asset, credit default swaps are used in several ways.
Speculation
Because swaps are traded, they naturally have fluctuating market values that a CDS trader can profit from. Investors buy and sell CDSs from each other, attempting to profit from the difference in prices.
1
Hedging
A credit default swap by itself is a form of hedging. A bank might purchase a CDS to hedge against
the risk of the borrower defaulting
. Insurance companies, pension funds, and other securities holders can purchase CDSs to hedge credit risk.
7
Arbitrage
Arbitrage generally involves purchasing a security in one market and selling it in another. CDSs can be used in arbitrage—an investor can purchase a bond in one market, then buy a CDS on the same reference entity on the CDS market.
8
Fast Fact
A credit default swap is the most common form of
credit derivative
and may involve municipal bonds, emerging market bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or corporate bonds.
9
The Great Recession
CDSs played a key role in the
credit crisis
that eventually led to the Great Recession. Credit default swaps were issued by American International Group (AIG), Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers to investors to protect against losses if the mortgages that were securitized into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) defaulted.
Mortgage-backed securities are mortgages bundled into packages and then offered as shares. The CDSs were insurance against mortgage defaults, so investors believed that they had completely reduced the risk of loss if the worst were to happen.
Mortgages were given to nearly anyone who requested them because investment banks and real estate investors were generating huge returns as housing prices continued to climb. CDSs allowed investment banks to create synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) instruments, which were bets on securitized mortgage prices.
10
Many investment banks issued MBSs, CDSs, and CDOs: They were all betting on the performance of their own mortgage security derivatives. When housing prices collapsed, the big players could not pay all of their obligations because they owed each other and investors more money than they had.
11
Fast Fact
Because these investment banks were so entwined in global markets, their insolvency caused global markets to waver and ushered in the financial crisis of 2007–2008.
10
Mechanics of Credit Default Swaps
The settlement process of credit default swaps involves several mechanisms aimed at determining the compensation owed to the protection buyer in the event of a credit event. There are two main methods of settlement: physical settlement and cash settlement.
In physical settlement, the protection buyer receives the underlying debt securities from the protection seller upon the occurrence of a credit event. The notional amount of the CDS contract represents the face value of the underlying debt securities. The protection buyer can then either hold the bonds as an investment or sell them in the secondary market.
In
cash settlement
, the compensation owed to the protection buyer is determined based on the results of a credit event auction conducted by a designated auction administrator. The auction aims to establish a market-based price for the defaulted debt securities. The final price is then used to calculate the cash settlement amount. Cash settlement is generally preferred in situations where there is limited liquidity in the underlying bond market.
Advantages and Disadvantages of CDSs
Pros of Credit Default Swaps
Credit default swaps offer several advantages for investors and institutions:
Risk Management
: CDS are a tool for managing credit risk. Investors can use CDS contracts to hedge against the risk of default on specific bonds or portfolios of bonds.
Portfolio Diversification
: CDS allow investors to diversify their portfolios by providing exposure to credit markets without directly owning the underlying bonds. This diversification can help reduce overall portfolio risk as CDS contracts offer flexibility in targeting specific credit exposures across different sectors and regions.
Liquidity Enhancement
: CDS markets are highly liquid, offering investors the ability to enter and exit positions quickly with minimal transaction costs. This liquidity can be particularly valuable in times of market stress when investors need to adjust their credit exposures swiftly.
Speculative Opportunities
: CDS provide investors with opportunities for speculation and profit generation. Through CDS contracts, investors can take directional views on credit markets, betting on the likelihood of default or changes in credit spreads.
Customization
: CDS contracts can offer flexibility in structuring credit protection to meet specific investor needs. Investors can pick CDS c",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp

Definition
SEC Release IA-1092 is a memo from the SEC that clarifies state and federal laws for investment advisers and financial planners, building on the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
What Is SEC Release IA-1092?
SEC Release IA-1092 is a release from the
Securities & Exchange Commission
(SEC) that provides uniform interpretations of how state and federal adviser laws apply to those that provide financial services.
1
SEC Release IA-1092 builds on the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
or the Advisers Act that Congress enacted to protect persons who rely on investment advisers for advice on purchasing and selling securities.
Key Takeaways
SEC Release IA-1092 clarifies how state and federal securities laws apply to investment advisers and financial planners.
1
This memo, which was issued in 1987, expands on the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
1
IA-1092 defines the roles and duties of investment advisers and pension consultants, in particular.
Understanding SEC Release IA-1092
SEC Release IA-1092 is the result of a 1987 collaboration between the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on the federal side and the
North American Securities Administrators Association
(NASAA) on the state side.
These organizations issued IA-1092 in 1987 as a memo in response to the proliferation of financial planning and investment advice professionals in the 1980s. The act reaffirmed the definition of an
investment adviser
(IA) as described in SEC Release IA-770 and added some refinements:
1
First, pension consultants and advisers to athletes and entertainers were included as providers of investment advice.
Second, in some cases, firms that recommend investment advisers also had to register themselves.
Even if an IA did not render investment advice as their principal business activity, simply doing so with some regularity in many cases was enough to require registration.
If a registered representative of a broker-dealer set up a separate business entity to provide financial planning or investment advice for a fee, they were not allowed to rely on the
broker-dealer
(BD) exemption from registration. (This became known as a statutory investment adviser.)
Compensation did not have to be monetary to fall under the definition. Simply the receipt of products, services, or even discounts was also considered compensation.
With regard to sports or entertainment agents, those individuals that negotiated contracts but did not render investment advice were excluded from the definition of an investment adviser.
SEC Release IA-1092 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 defines an investment adviser as any person who, either directly or indirectly through writings, engages in the business of advising others on the value or profitability of securities and receives compensation for this.
Guidelines for the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 can be found in Title 15 section 80b-1 of the United States Code, which notes that investment advisers are of national concern, due to:
2
Their advice, counsel, publications, writings, analyses, and reports being in line with interstate commerce.
Their work customarily relating to the purchase and sale of securities that trade on national securities exchanges and in interstate
over-the-counter
(OTC) markets.
Their connection with securities issued by companies engaged in interstate commerce.
The volume of transactions often materially affecting interstate commerce, national securities exchanges, other securities markets, the national banking system, and even the economy as a whole.

What Are FAANG Stocks?
In finance, “FAANG” is an acronym that refers to the stocks of five prominent American technology companies: Meta (
META
) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon (
AMZN
), Apple (
AAPL
), Netflix (
NFLX
); and Alphabet (
GOOG
) (formerly known as Google).
The term was popularized by Jim Cramer, the television host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" in 2013, who praised these companies for being “totally dominant in their markets."" Originally, the term ""
FANG
"" was used, with Apple—the second “A” in the acronym—added in 2017.
Key Takeaways
FAANG is an acronym referring to the stocks of the five most popular and best-performing American technology companies.
These are Meta (formerly known as Facebook); Amazon; Apple; Netflix; and Alphabet (formerly known as Google).
In addition to being widely known among consumers, the five FAANG stocks are among the largest companies in the world.
Some have raised concerns that the FAANG stocks may be in the midst of a bubble, whereas others argue that their growth is justified by the stellar financial and operational performance they have shown.
The term was coined by ""The Street's"" Bob Lang and popularized by Jim Cramer on his CNBC TV show ""Mad Money.""
Investopedia / Lara Antal
Understanding FAANG Stocks
In addition to being widely known among consumers, the five FAANG stocks are among the largest companies in the world, with a combined
market capitalization
of around $9 trillion as of Q2 2024.
1
2
3
4
5
Their substantial growth has been buoyed by high-profile purchases made by large and influential investors such as Berkshire Hathaway (
BRK
), Soros Fund Management, and Renaissance Technologies. These are just a few of the many large investors who have added FAANG stocks to their portfolios because of their perceived strength, growth, or momentum.
Each of the FAANG stocks trades on the
Nasdaq
exchange and is included in the
S&P 500 Index
. Since the S&P 500 is a broad representation of the market, the movement of the market mirrors the index's movement. As of Aug. 8, 2024, the FAANGs make up about 17.3% of the S&P 500 as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF—a staggering figure considering the S&P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the
United States economy
as a whole.

This large influence over the index means that volatility in the stock price of the FAANG stocks can have a substantial effect on the performance of the S&P 500 in general.
Fast Fact
Overall, it is through strong financial performance that the FAANG stocks have prospered. The five-year total return for these stocks is:
Meta: 176.20%
Amazon: 84.71%
Apple: 344.23%
Netflix: 105.21%
Alphabet: 175.65%
7
Influence of FAANG Stocks
The extraordinary size and influence of the FAANG stocks have prompted concerns about a potential
bubble
in FAANG stocks. These concerns started gaining prominence in 2018, when technology stocks, which had been driving consistent gains in the stock market, began losing their former strength.
The level of volatility sometimes shown by FAANG stocks—and the oversized influence these stocks can have on the market overall—is a source of concern for some investors.
On the other hand, those who believe in the fundamental strength of the FAANG stocks have abundant evidence for this claim. For example, Facebook is the world’s largest social network with approximately 2.9 billion monthly active users as of April 2024.
8
Amazon, meanwhile, has become a seemingly insurmountable force in
business-to-consumer (B2C)
e-commerce with over 600 million products for sale and over 310 million active customers worldwide.
9
10
What Makes FAANG Stocks So Popular?
The five stocks that make up the “FAANG” acronym—Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet—are all well-known brands among consumers. However, they are also famous for their remarkable growth with some of the largest market capitalizations in the world. From an investment perspective, these five stocks are generally praised for their stellar historical track records and clear leadership positions within their industries.
11
Are FAANG Stocks Overvalued?
Investors disagree about whether the FAANG stocks are overvalued. Their proponents will argue that their valuations are justified based on their fundamental strength as businesses. However, critics argue that, even with impressive business performance, the FAANG stocks’ prices have become so expensive that it may be difficult to realize attractive long-term profits from investing in them. Ultimately, this “debate” between investors is best captured by the buying and selling patterns in the FAANG stocks themselves.
Are FAANG Stocks Hard to Acquire?
No. The FAANG stocks are all easy to acquire, in the sense that they are publicly traded companies with substantial daily trading volumes. They are also routinely included in popular
exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
. However, investors who believe that the FAANG stocks may be overvalued would argue that they are difficult to acquire at an economical price. These investors may be tempted to delay purchasing FAANG stocks, waiting for their valuations to decline.
Who Coined the Term ""FAANG"" Stocks?
While Jim Cramer certainly popularized the term, he himself credits Bob Lang, a ""Real Money"" and ""The Street"" colleague of Cramer's, with identifying these four stocks and inventing the acronym.
12
Is Microsoft a FAANG Stock?
No. Microsoft is not a FAANG stock, which is why there is no ""M"" in the acronym. FAANG stocks were meant to describe hot, new high-growth tech companies of the 2010s. By then Microsoft was already a mature, older company.
The Bottom Line
Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet comprise the ""FAANG"" stocks, which is the grouping of the most highly successful technology stocks.
These companies are some of the largest companies in the world based on market capitalization as well as the most influential and powerful based on their popularity and market share, as well as the degree to which they shape the industry they operate in and the world at large.
Their growth has brought great returns to investors and they make up a big chunk of equity indexes. Despite their success, there continue to be concerns about their overvaluation, their business strength, and the risks involved with their influence and power.

The DuPont analysis is a formula that assesses how effectively a company is using the capital invested by its shareholders by dividing the company's net income by its shareholder equity.
What Is the DuPont Analysis?
The DuPont analysis is a framework for analyzing a company's fundamental performance. Developed decades ago at DuPont de Nemours, Inc., the DuPont analysis breaks out the different drivers of return on equity (ROE), allowing company managers and investors to focus on them individually and identify strengths and weaknesses.
There are two versions of the tool—one that involves three steps and another that uses five.
Key Takeaways
DuPont analysis breaks out the various drivers of return on equity (ROE) such as profitability and asset utilization.
Managers can use it to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed.
An investor can use it to compare the operational efficiency of two similar companies.
The DuPont formula has been in use since 1919.

How the DuPont Analysis Works
The DuPont analysis is a formula used to evaluate a company's financial performance based on its return on equity (ROE). By most accounts, it was
devised in 1919
by a DuPont executive.
1
A company's ROE is calculated by
dividing its net income by shareholders' equity
. It reveals how well a company utilizes capital from shareholders.
A DuPont analysis goes a step further and allows an investor to determine which financial activities contribute the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can also use the DuPont analysis to compare the
operational efficiency
of two similar companies, while company managers can use it to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed.

There are three major financial metrics that drive ROE:
Operating efficiency
, which is represented by
net profit margin
or net income divided by total sales or revenue
Asset use efficiency
, which is measured by the
asset turnover ratio
Financial
leverage
, a metric that is measured by the equity multiplier, which is equal to average assets divided by average equity
Formula and Calculation of the DuPont Analysis
The DuPont analysis is an expanded return on equity formula, calculated by multiplying the net profit margin by the asset turnover by the
equity multiplier
.

or DuPont model.
Components of the DuPont Analysis
As mentioned, a DuPont analysis breaks ROE into its constituent components to determine which of these factors are most responsible for changes in ROE.
Net Profit Margin
The net profit margin is the ratio of bottom line profits compared to total revenue or total sales. This is one of the most basic measures of profitability.
One way to think about the net margin is to imagine a store that sells a certain product for $1. After the costs associated with buying inventory, maintaining a location, and paying employees, taxes, interest, and other expenses, the store owner keeps $0.15 in profit from each unit sold. That means the owner's profit margin is 15%, which can be calculated as follows:

​
The profit margin could be improved if costs for the owner were reduced or if prices on the product were raised, which could have a large impact on ROE. This is one of the reasons that a company's stock will experience high levels of
volatility
when management makes a change to its guidance for future margins, costs, and prices.
Asset Turnover Ratio
The asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue. Imagine a company that had $100 in assets and made $1,000 of total revenue last year. The assets generated 10 times their value in total revenue, which is the same as the asset turnover ratio and can be calculated as follows:

A normal asset turnover ratio will vary from one industry group to another. For example, a discount retailer or grocery store will generate a lot of revenue from its assets with a small margin, which will make the asset turnover ratio very large.
On the other hand, a utility company owns very expensive fixed assets relative to its revenue, which will result in an asset turnover ratio that is much lower than that of a retail firm.
The ratio can be helpful when comparing two companies that operate in the same industry. Because average assets include components like inventory, changes in this ratio can signal that sales are slowing down or speeding up earlier than they would show up in other financial measures. If a company's asset turnover rises, its ROE improves.
Financial Leverage
Financial leverage, or the equity multiplier, is an indirect analysis of a company's use of debt to finance its assets. Assume a company has $1,000 in assets and $250 of owner's equity. The balance sheet equation will tell you that the company also has $750 in debt (assets - liabilities = equity).
If the company borrows more to purchase assets, the ratio will continue to rise. The accounts used to calculate financial leverage are both on the balance sheet, so analysts will divide average assets by average equity rather than the balance at the end of the period, as follows:
Financial Leverage
=
Average Assets
Average Equity
=

​
Most companies should use debt with equity to fund operations and growth. Not using any leverage could put the company at a disadvantage compared with its peers. However, using too much debt in order to increase the financial leverage ratio—and therefore increase ROE—can create disproportionate risks.
A point to note, though, is that some companies use balance sheet averages when one of the components is an income statement metric. In the case illustrated above, no averaging is necessary as the equation takes balance sheet/balance sheet figures into account.
Drawbacks of the DuPont Analysis
The biggest
drawback of the DuPont analysis
is that it still relies on accounting equations and data that can be manipulated. Plus, even with its comprehensiveness, the DuPont analysis lacks context as to why the individual ratios are high or low, or even whether they should be considered high or low at all.
Example of the DuPont Analysis
Here's a hypothetical example to show how the DuPont analysis works. Let's say an investor has been watching two similar companies, SuperCo and Gear Inc. Both of these companies have improved their return on equity compared to the rest of their
peer group

An interest rate is the price an entity pays for borrowing money or the fee they charge for lending it, expressed as a percentage.
What Is an Interest Rate?
The interest rate is the percentage of interest relative to the
principal
. It is either what lenders charge borrowers or what is earned from deposit accounts.
The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis and is expressed as an
annual percentage rate
(APR).
1
An interest rate can also apply to a savings account or a
certificate of deposit
(CD). In this case, a bank or credit union pays a percentage of the funds deposited to the account holder.
Annual percentage yield
(APY) refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts.
2
Key Takeaways
An interest rate also applies to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a deposit account.
Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods.
A loan that is considered low-risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high-risk will have a higher interest rate.
The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. Savings accounts and CDs use compound interest.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Interest Rates
In lending, interest is a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property. Because of this, an interest rate can be thought of as the ""cost of money."" Higher interest rates make borrowing the same amount of money more expensive.
Interest rates
apply to most lending or borrowing
transactions. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes, fund projects, launch or fund businesses, or pay for college tuition. Businesses take out loans to fund capital projects and expand their operations by purchasing fixed and long-term assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. Borrowed money is repaid either in a lump sum by a pre-determined date or in periodic installments.
For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the
cost of debt
for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged.
When the loan is considered to be low risk by the lender, the borrower will usually be charged a lower interest rate. If the loan is considered high risk, the interest rate that the borrower is charged will be higher.
Important
Risk is typically assessed when a lender looks at a potential borrower's credit score, which is why it's important to have an excellent one if you want to qualify for the best loans.
Simple Interest Rate
If you take out a $300,000 loan from the bank and the loan agreement stipulates that the interest rate on the loan is 4% simple interest, this means that you will have to pay the bank the original loan amount of $300,000 + (4% x $300,000) = $300,000 + $12,000 = $312,000.
The example above was calculated based on the annual
simple interest
formula, which is:
Simple interest
= principal x interest rate x time
The individual who took out the loan will have to pay $12,000 in interest at the end of the year, assuming it was only a one-year lending agreement. If the loan was a 30-year mortgage, the interest payment will be:
Simple interest
= $300,000 x 4% x 30 = $360,000
A simple interest rate of 4% annually translates into an annual interest payment of $12,000. After 30 years, the borrower would have made $12,000 x 30 years = $360,000 in interest payments.
Compound Interest Rate
Some lenders prefer the
compound interest
method, which means that the borrower pays even more in interest. Compound interest, also called
interest on interest
, is applied both to the principal and also to the accumulated interest made during previous periods. The bank assumes that at the end of the first year the borrower owes the principal plus interest for that year. The bank also assumes that at the end of the second year, the borrower owes the principal plus the interest for the first year plus the interest on interest for the first year.
The interest owed when
compounding
is higher than the interest owed using the simple interest method. The interest is charged monthly on the principal, including accrued interest from the previous months. For shorter time frames, the calculation of interest will be similar for both methods. As the lending time increases, however, the disparity between the two types of interest calculations grows.
Using the example above, at the end of 30 years, the total owed in interest is almost $673,019 on a $300,000 loan with a 4% interest rate.
The following formula can be used to calculate compound interest:
Compound interest
= p x [(1 + interest rate)
n
− 1]
where:
p
= principal
n
= number of compounding periods​
Let's look at another example. Jayati takes out a three-year loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 5%, which compounds annually. In the end, as worked out in the calculation below, she pays $1,576.25 in interest on the loan:
$10,000 [(1 + 0.05)
3
– 1] = $10,000 [1.157625 – 1] = $1,576.25
Compound Interest and Savings Accounts
When you save money using a savings account, compound interest is favorable. The interest earned on these accounts is compounded and serves as compensation to the account holder for allowing the bank to use the deposited funds.
If, for example, you deposit $500,000 into a
high-yield savings account
, the bank can take $300,000 of these funds to use as a mortgage loan. To compensate you, the bank pays 5% interest into the account annually. So, while the bank is taking 8% from the borrower, it is giving 5% to you, the account holder, netting it 3% in interest. In effect, savers lend the bank money which, in turn, provides funds to borrowers in return for interest.
APR vs. APY
Interest rates on consumer loans are typically quoted as the
annual percentage rate (APR)
. This is the rate of return that lenders demand for the ability to borrow their money.
3
For example, the interest rate on credit cards is quoted as an APR. In our example above, 4% is the APR for the
mortgage
. The APR does not consider compounded interest for the year.
The annual percentage yield (APY) is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. This interest rate takes compounding into account.
How Are Interest Rates Determined?
The interest rate charged by banks is determined by a number of factors, including the state of the economy. A country's
central bank
(e.g., the
Federal Reserve
in the U.S.) sets the interest rate, which each bank uses to determine the APR range they offer.
4
When the central bank sets interest rates at a high level, the cost of debt rises. When the cost of debt is high, it discourages people from borrowing and slows consumer demand. Interest rates tend to rise with
inflation
.
In a high-interest-rate economy, businesses have limited access to capital funding through debt, which can lead to economic contraction.
Economies are often stimulated during periods of low interest rates because borrowers have access to loans at inexpensive rates. Since interest rates on savings are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to spend and purchase riskier investment vehicles such as stocks. This spending fuels the economy and provides an injection to
capital markets
leading to economic expansion.
While governments prefer lower interest rates, they eventually lead to market disequilibrium where demand exceeds supply, causing inflation. When inflation occurs, interest rates increase, which may relate to
Walras' law

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization.
What Is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)?
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a
stock exchange
located in New York City that is the largest
equities
-based exchange in the world, based on the total
market capitalization
of its listed securities.
Formerly run as a private organization, the NYSE became a public entity on March 8, 2006, following the acquisition of electronic trading exchange
Archipelago
.
1
In 2007, a merger with
Euronext
—the largest stock exchange in Europe—led to the creation of NYSE Euronext, which was later acquired by Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (
ICE
), the current parent of the New York Stock Exchange.
2
Key Takeaways
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which dates back to 1792, is the largest stock exchange in the world based on the total market capitalization of its listed securities.
It was the first formalized stock exchange established in the United States.
Many of the oldest publicly traded U.S. companies are listed on the ""Big Board,"" the nickname for the NYSE.
The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) now owns the NYSE, having purchased the exchange in 2013.
Understanding the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
Located on Wall Street in New York City,
the New York Stock Exchange
—also known as the ""
Big Board
""— consists of one trading floor for equities and another for the NYSE American
options
exchange. The main building located at 18 Broad St. and the one at 11 Wall St. were both designated historical landmarks in 1978.
3
The NYSE relied for many years on floor trading only, using the
open outcry
system. Many NYSE trades have transitioned to electronic systems relying mainly on
designated market makers
to conduct both the physical and automated auctions. Quotes offered by DMMs are on par with what
floor traders
and other market participants offer.
Currently, the NYSE is open for trading Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. The stock exchange is closed on certain U.S. holidays. When these fall on a Saturday, the NYSE is sometimes closed the preceding Friday. When holidays fall on a Sunday, the NYSE may be closed the following Monday.
4
Fast Fact
The NYSE is the world's largest stock exchange by total market capitalization of
listed companies
, which is estimated to be $24.6 trillion as of Mid-2022.
5
The NYSE's Opening and Closing Bells
The opening and closing bells of the exchange mark the beginning and end of the trading day. The
opening bell
is rung at 9:30 a.m. ET, and the
closing bell
is rung at 4:00 p.m. ET, closing trading for the day. But trading days did not always begin and end with a bell—the original signal was actually a gavel. During the late 1800s, the NYSE changed the gavel to a gong. The bell became the official signal for the exchange in 1903 when the NYSE moved to 18 Broad St.
6
Prior to 1995, the exchange's floor managers rang the bells. But the NYSE began inviting company executives to ring the opening and closing bells on a regular basis, which later became a daily event. The executives are from companies listed on the exchange, who sometimes coordinate their appearances with marketing events, such as the launch of a new product or innovation, or a merger or
acquisition
.
Sometimes, other public figures, such as athletes and celebrities, ring the bell. Some of the more notable figures to ring it include singer/actor Liza Minnelli, Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, and rapper Snoop Dogg. In July 2013, United Nations Secretary Ban Ki-moon rang the closing bell to mark the NYSE joining the U.N. Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative.
7
Fast Fact
The New York Stock Exchange passed the milestone of one million shares traded in a single day in 1888. By 2022, more than five billion shares were changing hands on the NYSE during a normal business day.
8
History of the NYSE
The New York Stock Exchange dates back to May 17, 1792. On that day, 24 stockbrokers from New York City signed the
Buttonwood Agreement
at 68 Wall St. The New York Stock Exchange kicked off with five securities, which included three government bonds and two bank stocks.
9
Thanks to the NYSE's head start as the major U.S. stock exchange, many of the
oldest publicly traded companies
are on the exchange. Consolidated Edison (
ED
) is the longest-listed NYSE stock, joining in 1824 as the New York Gas Light Company.
10
Along with American stocks, foreign-based corporations can also list their shares on the NYSE if they adhere to certain listing standards.
11
A series of
mergers
has given the New York Stock Exchange its massive size and global presence. The company started as NYSE before merging with the Euronext and adding the American Stock Exchange.
12
NYSE Euronext was purchased in an $11 billion deal by the
Intercontinental Exchange
(ICE) in 2013.
13
The following year, Euronext emerged from ICE via an
initial public offering
(IPO), but ICE retained ownership of the NYSE.
14

Investopedia,"LIBOR: What Was the London Interbank Offered Rate, and How Was It Used?","Close
Definition
LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) was a key reference point for the interest rates banks charged each other on short-term loans across global financial markets.
What Was the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)?
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was a
benchmark
interest rate for short-term loans between major global banks. It was mostly phased out in 2023 and then completely in 2024.
From 1986 to the 2000s, LIBOR was a globally accepted key benchmark for the cost of borrowing between banks. The rate was calculated and published each day by the
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
, but scandals and questions around its validity as a benchmark rate resulted in it being phased out.
According to the Federal Reserve and regulators in the United Kingdom, LIBOR was phased out on June 30, 2023, and replaced by the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
. LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBORs stopped publishing as of Dec. 31, 2021, as part of the phaseout.

Key Takeaways
LIBOR was the benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lent to one another.
LIBOR was administered by the Intercontinental Exchange, which asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans.
The rate was calculated using the Waterfall Methodology, a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method.
LIBOR had been subject to manipulation, scandal, and methodological critique, making it less credible as a benchmark rate.
LIBOR was replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) on June 30, 2023.
How LIBOR Worked
LIBOR was the average interest rate at which major global banks borrowed from one another. It was based on five currencies—the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc—and served seven different maturities: overnight/spot next, one week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months.

Interbank lending is the basis for consumer loans in countries around the world, so it impacts consumers just as much as it does financial institutions. The interest rates on various credit products, such as credit cards, car loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), fluctuate based on the
interbank rate
. This change in rate helps determine the ease of borrowing between banks and consumers.

The combination of five currencies and seven maturities led to a total of 35 different LIBORs calculated and reported each business day. The most commonly quoted rate was the three-month U.S. dollar rate, usually referred to as the current LIBOR.
1
ICE calculated the LIBOR by asking major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans. The association took out the highest and lowest figures, then
calculated the average
from the remaining numbers. This is known as the trimmed average.
This rate was posted each morning as the daily rate and announced and published once a day around 11:55 a.m. London time by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA).
1
Important
LIBOR was phased out in June 2023 and replaced by the Secure Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).
How Was LIBOR Calculated?
The IBA had a designated panel of global banks for each currency and tenor pair. For example, 16 major banks, including Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS, constituted the panel for the U.S. dollar LIBOR. Only those banks with a significant role in the London market were considered eligible for membership on the ICE LIBOR panel, and the selection process was held annually.
1
In April 2018, the IBA submitted a new proposal to strengthen the LIBOR calculation methodology. It suggested a standardized, transaction-based, data-driven, layered method called the Waterfall Methodology for determining LIBOR.
2
The first transaction-based level involved taking a
volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
of all eligible transactions that a panel bank may have assigned a higher weighting for transactions booked closer to 11 a.m. London time.
The second transaction-derived level involved taking submissions based on transaction-derived data from a panel bank if it did not have a sufficient number of eligible transactions to make a Level 1 submission.
The third level—expert judgment—would come into play when a panel bank failed to make a Level 1 or a Level 2 submission. It would submit the rate at which it could finance itself at 11 a.m. London time, with reference to the unsecured, wholesale funding market.
The IBA calculated the LIBOR using a
trimmed mean
approach applied to all the responses received. The trimmed mean is a method of averaging that eliminates a small specified percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean. For LIBOR, figures in the highest and lowest quartile are thrown out, and averaging is performed on the remaining numbers.
3
Uses of LIBOR
LIBOR had been used worldwide
in a variety of financial products. They included the following:
Standard interbank products like forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, options, and
swaptions
, whereby options provide buyers with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security or interest rate product
Commercial products like floating rate certificates of deposit (CDs) and notes, variable rate mortgages, and syndicated loans, which are loans offered by a group of lenders
Hybrid products like
collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and a wide variety of accrual notes, callable notes, and perpetual notes
Consumer loan-related products like individual mortgages and student loans
LIBOR was also used as a standard gauge of market expectations for interest rates finalized by central banks. It accounted for the liquidity premiums for various instruments traded in the money markets, as well as an indicator of the health of the overall banking system.
A lot of
derivative
products were created, launched, and traded in reference to LIBOR. LIBOR was also used as a reference rate for other standard processes like
clearing
, price discovery, and product valuation.
A Brief History of LIBOR
The need for a uniform measure of interest rates across financial institutions became necessary as the market for interest rate-based products began evolving during the 1980s. The
British Bankers’ Association (BBA)
, which represented the banking and financial services industry, set up BBA interest-settlement rates in 1984.
4
Further streamlining led to the evolution of BBA LIBOR in 1986, which became the default standard interest rate for transacting in the interest rate- and currency-based financial dealings between financial institutions at the local and international levels.
4
LIBOR then underwent many changes. The major one was when BBA LIBOR changed to ICE LIBOR in February 2014 after the Intercontinental Exchange took over the administration.
5
Currencies once used in calculating LIBOR also changed. While new currency rates had been added, many had been removed or integrated following the introduction of the euro rates. The 2007–2008 financial crisis saw a significant decline in the number of tenors for which LIBOR was calculated.
6
Alternatives to LIBOR
Though LIBOR was once accepted globally, there are
several other interest rates
that are popularly followed around the globe.
For instance, Europe has the European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Japan has the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), China has the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR), and India has the
Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR)
.
LIBOR Rate Rigging Scandal
While LIBOR was a long-established global benchmark standard for interest rates, it was also the subject of a major
scandal of rate rigging
.
Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate the LIBORs. They took traders’ requests into account and submitted artificially low LIBORs to keep them at their preferred levels. The intention behind the alleged malpractice was to bump up the profits of traders who were holding positions in LIBOR-based financial securities.
7
Following reporting by
The Wall Street Journal
in 2008, major global banks, which were on the panels and contributed to the LIBOR determination process, faced regulatory scrutiny, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. Similar investigations were launched in other parts of the globe, including in the U.K. and Europe.
8
Major banks and financial institutions, including Barclays, ICAP, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, faced heavy fines. Punitive actions were also taken against their employees who were found to be involved in the malpractice. The scandal was also one of the primary reasons why LIBOR shifted from BBA administration to ICE.
7
Note
LIBOR was susceptible to rate-rigging because banks could submit artificially high or low estimates of their lending rates. The new metric, SOFR, uses actual lending rates, not the banks' estimations.
Benefits of LIBOR Analysis
Despite the rate-setting scandals, LIBOR provided a useful benchmark for the level of activity in the global economy. A falling LIBOR meant it was easier to borrow money, possibly forecasting an increase in economic activity. A rising LIBOR meant that it was getting harder to borrow money and that business activity was likely to slow down.
These rates were particularly significant to a prospective borrower. When you borrowed money from a bank, LIBORs may have accounted for part of your interest rate. A high LIBOR meant that you could have to pay a higher interest rate on your mortgage or personal loan, while a low LIBOR meant a more favorable rate.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a calculation of a company’s total liabilities and shareholder equity that evaluates its reliance on debt.
What Is the Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio?
The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. It's calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance because it's a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources.
The debt-to-equity ratio is a type of gearing ratio.
Key Takeaways
The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company's total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt.
D/E ratios vary by industry and are best used to compare direct competitors or to measure changes in a company's reliance on debt over time.
A higher D/E ratio among similar companies suggests more risk.
A particularly low ratio may indicate that a business isn't taking advantage of debt financing to expand.
Investors will often modify the D/E ratio to consider only long-term debt because it carries more risk than short-term obligations.

Debt/Equity

Total Liabilities
Total Shareholders’ Equity
\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Liabilities} }{ \text{Total Shareholders' Equity} } \\ \end{aligned}
​
Debt/Equity
=
Total Shareholders’ Equity
Total Liabilities
​
​
The necessary information to calculate the D/E ratio can be found on a company's balance sheet. Subtracting the value of liabilities from total assets provides the figure for
shareholder equity
.
These balance sheet categories may include items that wouldn't normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. The ratio can be distorted by
retained earnings
or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, so further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt.
Analysts and investors will often modify the D/E ratio to get a clearer picture and facilitate comparisons. They also assess the D/E ratio in the context of short-term
leverage ratios
, profitability, and growth expectations.
Melissa Ling © Investopedia 2019
Calculating the D/E Ratio in Excel
Business owners use a variety of software to track D/E ratios and other financial metrics. For example, Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and the debt ratio.

Your other option is to manually enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, such as in B2 and B3, and then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.
What Does the D/E Ratio Tell You?
The D/E ratio measures how much debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities. Debt must be repaid or refinanced, and it imposes interest expenses that typically can’t be deferred. This can impair or destroy the value of equity in the event of a default. A high D/E ratio is often associated with high investment risk as a result. It means that a company relies primarily on debt financing.
Debt-financed growth can increase earnings, and shareholders should expect to benefit if the incremental profit increase exceeds the related rise in debt service costs. The share price may drop, however, if the additional cost of debt financing outweighs the additional income it generates. The cost of debt and a company’s ability to service it can vary with market conditions. Borrowing that seemed prudent at first can prove unprofitable later as a result.
Changes in long-term debt and assets tend to affect the D/E ratio the most because the numbers tend to be larger than for short-term debt and short-term assets.
Investors can use other ratios if they want to evaluate a company’s short-term leverage and its ability to meet debt obligations that must be paid over a year or less.
The
cash ratio
evaluates a company’s near-term liquidity:
Cash Ratio
=
Cash
+
Marketable Securities
Short-Term Liabilities
\begin{aligned} &\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} }{ \text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\ \end{aligned}
​
Cash Ratio
=
Short-Term Liabilities
Cash
+
Marketable Securities
​
​
The
current ratio
does the same:
Current Ratio
=
Short-Term Assets
Short-Term Liabilities
\begin{aligned} &\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Short-Term Assets} }{ \text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\ \end{aligned}
​
Current Ratio
=
Short-Term Liabilities
Short-Term Assets
​
​
Example of the D/E Ratio
Let’s consider an example from Apple Inc. (
AAPL
). We can see below that Apple had total liabilities of $279 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $74 billion as of Q1 2024, which ended on Dec. 30, 2023.
2
Using the above formula, the D/E ratio for Apple can be calculated as:
Debt-to-equity = $279 Billion / $74 Billion = 3.77
Apple had $3.77 of debt for every dollar of equity. The ratio doesn’t give investors the complete picture on its own, however. It’s important to compare the ratio with that of similar companies.
Modifying the D/E Ratio
The long-term D/E ratio focuses on riskier long-term debt by using its value instead of that of total liabilities in the numerator of the standard formula:
Long-term D/E ratio = Long-term debt ÷ Shareholder equity
Short-term debt also increases a company's leverage, but these liabilities must be paid in a year or less, so they're not as risky. Imagine a company with $1 million in short-term payables, such as wages, accounts payable, and notes, and $500,000 in long-term debt. Compare this with a company with $500,000 in short-term payables and $1 million in long-term debt.
They would both have a D/E ratio of 1 if both companies had $1.5 million in shareholder equity. The risk from leverage is identical on the surface but the second company is riskier in reality.
Short-term debt tends to be cheaper than long-term debt as a rule, and it's less sensitive to shifts in interest rates. The second company's interest expense and cost of capital are therefore likely higher. Interest expense will rise if interest rates are higher when the long-term debt comes due and has to be refinanced.
Debt due sooner shouldn't be a concern if we assume that the company won't default over the next year. A company's ability to service long-term debt will depend on its long-term business prospects, which are less certain.
The D/E Ratio for Personal Finances
The D/E ratio can apply to personal financial statements as well, serving as a personal D/E ratio. Equity refers to the difference between the total value of an individual's assets and their aggregate debt or liabilities, in this case. The formula for the personal D/E ratio is slightly different:
Debt/Equity
=
Total Personal Liabilities
Personal Assets
−
Liabilities
\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Personal Liabilities} }{ \text{Personal Assets} - \text{Liabilities} } \\ \end{aligned}
​
Debt/Equity
=
Personal Assets
−
Liabilities
Total Personal Liabilities
​
​
The personal D/E ratio is often used when an individual or a small business is applying for a loan. Lenders use the D/E figure to assess a loan applicant's ability to continue making loan payments in the event of a temporary loss of income.
A prospective mortgage borrower is more likely to be able to continue making payments during a period of extended unemployment if they have more assets than debt. This is also true for an individual who's applying for a small business loan or a line of credit.
It's more likely that a business owner can continue making loan payments until their debt-financed investment starts paying off if they have a good personal D/E ratio.
D/E Ratio vs. Gearing Ratio
Gearing ratios constitute a broad category of financial ratios. The D/E ratio is the best known of them. “Gearing” is a term for financial leverage.
Gearing ratios focus more heavily on the concept of leverage than other ratios used in accounting or investment analysis. The underlying principle generally assumes that some leverage is good, but too much places ",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp
Investopedia,"Key Person Insurance: Definition, Cost, Types, and How It Works","Close
Definition
Key person insurance is a life policy bought by a business on an essential employee, with the company as the beneficiary, to protect against financial loss if the employee dies or becomes incapacitated.
What Is Key Person Insurance?
Key person insurance is a
life insurance
policy that a company purchases on the life of an owner, a top executive, or another individual considered critical to the business. The company is the
beneficiary
of the policy and pays the
premiums
. This type of life insurance is also known as ""key man (or ""keyman"") insurance,"" ""key woman insurance,"" and ""business life insurance.""
Key Takeaways
Key person insurance is a life insurance policy a company buys on the life of a top executive or another critical individual.
Such insurance is needed if that person's death would be devastating to the future of the company.
For small businesses, the key person might be the owner or founder.
The company pays the insurance premiums and is the policy's beneficiary, should the person die.
Understanding Key Person Insurance
Key person insurance offers a financial cushion if the sudden loss of a certain individual would profoundly negatively affect the company's operations. The
death benefit
essentially buys the company time to find a new person or to implement other strategies to save (or shut down) the business.
In a small business, the key person is usually the owner, the founders, or perhaps a key employee or two. The main qualifying point is whether the person's absence would cause major financial harm to the company. If this is the case, key person insurance is definitely worth considering.
Important
In addition to life insurance, key person insurance is also available as disability coverage in case the individual is incapacitated and no longer able to work.
The Process of Key Person Insurance
For key person insurance, a company purchases a life insurance policy on certain employee(s), pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of the policy. In the event of the person's death, the company receives the policy's death benefit.
That money can be used to cover the costs of recruiting, hiring, and training a replacement for the deceased person. If the company doesn't believe it can continue operations, it can use the money to pay off debts, distribute money to investors, provide severance benefits to employees, and close the business down in an orderly manner. Key person insurance gives the company some options other than immediate
bankruptcy
.
To determine whether a business needs this kind of coverage, company leaders must consider who is irreplaceable in the short term. In many small businesses, it's the owner who does most things, such as keeping the books, managing employees, handling key customers, etc. Without this person, the business can come to a stop.
Categories of Loss Covered by Key Person Insurance
Key person insurance can cover a company against a range of risks. For example, it may provide:
Insurance to protect profits—for example, offsetting lost income from lost sales or losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project involving a key person.
Insurance designed to protect shareholders or partnership interests. Typically, this enables the surviving shareholders or partners to purchase the financial interests of the deceased person.
Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee.
Cost of Key Person Insurance
How much insurance a company needs will depend on the size and nature of the business and the key person's role. It's worth asking for quotes on $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, $750,000, and $1 million policies and comparing the costs of each.
The cost will also depend on whether the company buys a
term life policy
or a
permanent life policy
. Term life is almost always significantly cheaper.
In addition, the cost of the coverage will vary on a variety of factors, such as the health of the key person, their gender, their age, the type of policy, the amount of coverage, the type of company, its structure, and the industry it is part of.
What Are the Benefits of Key Person Insurance?
Key person insurance financially protects a company against the death or incapacitation of its key person. The money from the insurance helps a company replace the key person and the costs associated with doing so. It can also be used to pay off debts, pay back investors, or cover any other financial costs the company may incur when losing its key person.
How Much Key Person Insurance Do You Need?
The amount of key person insurance needed for a business will vary depending on the business and the type of role the key person plays. Purchasing key person insurance that is eight to 10 times the key person's salary is often recommended or the monetary value of the key person. The latter option can be difficult to value, but methods include the amount of revenues/profits associated with the key person or the costs required to replace the key person, which includes recruitment, training, and the loss of revenue in the time it takes to replace the individual.
Who Pays for Key Person Insurance?
The company that purchases the key person insurance is the entity that pays the premiums for the insurance. The key person does not pay the insurance.
The Bottom Line
Key person insurance allows a company to continue to operate in the event of the loss of an individual critical to the success of the business. The death benefit to the company can cover a variety of costs to ensure the business can survive the sudden loss of its key person. Choosing the right key person insurance, the amount of the policy, and other details is particularly important for small businesses and new startups.

Investopedia,Qualified Retirement Plan: Definition and 2 Main Types,"Close
What Is a Qualified Retirement Plan?
A qualified retirement plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that meets the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
and the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
, making it eligible for certain tax benefits. These can include tax deductions for employer and employee contributions and
tax deferral
of investment
gains
.
Key Takeaways
A qualified retirement plan is an employer-sponsored plan that meets Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. Labor Department requirements and offers certain tax benefits to employees and employers.
Those benefits can include tax deductions for contributions and tax deferral of investment gains until the money is withdrawn from the account.
Qualified retirement plans can be either defined benefit or defined contribution plans.
Examples of qualified retirement plans include traditional pensions, 401(k) plans, and profit-sharing plans.
Understanding Qualified Retirement Plans
Qualified retirement plans come in two main types:
defined benefit
and
defined contribution
.
There are also some other plans that are hybrids of the two, such as a
cash balance plan
.
Defined-benefit plans give employees a guaranteed
payout
after retirement and place the risk on the employer to save and invest properly to meet plan
liabilities
. A traditional,
annuity
-type
pension
is an example of a defined-benefit plan.
With defined-contribution plans, the amount of money that employees will have available to them in retirement depends on how much they contribute and how successfully they invest those contributions. The employee typically chooses what to invest in and bears all of the investment risk. A
401(k)
is the most popular example of a defined contribution plan.

457 plans
Money purchase plans
Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)
Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP) plans
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans
Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plans
Requirements for Qualified Retirement Plans
The tax code lays out a long list of requirements that plans must meet to be qualified.
For example, employees must be eligible to participate in the plan no later than the date when they turn 21 years old or the date when they complete one year of service, whichever comes later.
1
Once they are eligible to participate, employees must be allowed to join the plan no later than the first day of the first plan year beginning after the date when they met the minimum age and service requirements or six months after the date when they satisfied those requirements, whichever comes earlier.
1
The tax code also establishes the rules for
vesting
,
employer matching contributions
,
rollovers
,
distributions
, and more.
1
Fast Fact
Employers have some leeway within these rules, but once they have put the specifics of their plan in writing—as they are required to do—they must adhere to them unless they amend the plan.
Qualified retirement plans are also subject to the rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. One of its chief requirements is that plan sponsors (employers) and administrators act as
fiduciaries
, meaning that they must make investment decisions in the best interest of plan participants. If they fail to do that, they can be held personally liable to make up any losses.
2
Tax Benefits of Qualified Retirement Plans
Employers that provide qualified retirement plans for their employees can take a tax deduction for the money they contribute to the plans up to certain limits.
3
Those limits depend on the type of plan, with defined-benefit plans having higher contribution limits than defined-contribution plans.
4
The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
also sets limits for the
maximum amount of contributions
an employee can make to the plan.
With traditional defined-contribution plans, employees can take a tax deduction for their contributions, reducing their taxable income and, therefore, their taxes for the year. They’ll pay tax on that income only when they later withdraw it, usually in retirement. In the meantime, the investment earnings on the money in their account will be tax-deferred, again until it’s withdrawn. (
Roth-type accounts
are an exception here—they don’t provide any tax deduction going in, but later withdrawals will be tax and penalty-free, as long as the account owner is over age 59 ½ and has had the account for over five years.)
Depending on the specific provisions of the employer’s plan, qualified plans can also allow employees to take out loans and make penalty-free
hardship withdrawals
under certain circumstances.
What Is a Non-Qualified Retirement Plan?
Non-qualified retirement plans
are employer-sponsored plans that don’t meet all of the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). They don’t receive all of the tax advantages of qualified plans. Non-qualified plans are primarily used to incentivize and reward a company’s top executives.
Are Qualified Retirement Plans Federally Insured?
Many defined-benefit plans, or traditional pensions, are insured by the federal
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
up to certain limits. Defined-contribution plans, on the other hand, are not insured.
How Are Withdrawals from Qualified Retirement Plans Taxed?
Withdrawals, or distributions, from qualified retirement plans must be included in the taxpayer’s income for that year and are
taxed at the same rate as their ordinary income
, such as a salary.
As long as the account has been open for more than five years, Roth-type accounts are eligible for tax-free withdrawals. This is because the
income
that was used to fund the account's contributions has already been taxed.
5
The Bottom Line
Qualified retirement plans are employer-sponsored plans that meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and are
eligible for certain tax benefits
, such as tax deductions for contributions and tax deferral of investment gains. Qualified retirement plans can be either defined benefit or defined contribution plans.

What Is a Trust Fund?
A trust fund is an
estate planning
tool that holds property or assets for a person or an organization. Trust funds are sometimes simply referred to as ""trusts."" They can hold a variety of assets such as money, real property, stocks, bonds, a business, or a combination of many types of properties or
assets
.
Establishing a trust fund involves multiple parties: the grantor, the beneficiary or beneficiaries, and the trustee. Trust funds can have more than one beneficiary. They're managed by the trustee who has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the grantor and beneficiaries.
Trust funds can take many forms and they can be established with different stipulations. They can be revocable or irrevocable. Some offer tax benefits and financial protections as well as support for those involved.
Key Takeaways
A trust fund is a legal entity designed to hold and manage assets on someone's behalf, usually with the help of a neutral third party.
Trust fund parties include a grantor, beneficiary or beneficiaries, and a trustee.
The grantor who creates the trust fund sets the terms for how assets are to be held, gathered, and distributed.
The trustee manages the fund's assets and executes the grantor's directives. The beneficiary receives the assets or other benefits from the fund.
Trust funds can be revocable or irrevocable and several variations can exist within these categories for specific purposes.
Investopedia / Joules Garcia
How Trust Funds Work
Estate planning is a process that involves determining how an individual's assets and other financial affairs will be managed and how any property they own will be distributed after they die. Property can include any bank accounts, investments, personal property, real estate, and/or
life insurance
. Wills are the most common estate planning tool but trust funds are also popular legal entities.
Laws governing trust funds
can vary depending on the country of residency and creation.
The following parties are involved in establishing a trust:

grantor
who sets up the trust and funds it with their assets
The beneficiaries or person for whom the assets are managed
The
trustee
, a neutral third party such as an individual, a bank, or another professional fiduciary who's charged with managing the trust assets
The grantor generally creates an inheritance arrangement that's carried out after they're no longer mentally competent or alive. As the appointed
fiduciary
, the trustee is responsible for carrying out the interests and wishes of the grantor. This can include allocating living expenses or even educational expenses such as private school or college expenses and/or paying a
lump sum
or transferring property to the beneficiary or beneficiaries after death.
Trust funds provide certain benefits and protections for those who create them and their beneficiaries.
Irrevocable trusts can protect assets from
creditors
in the event they decide to pursue the grantor for unpaid debts.
Trusts avoid the need for
probate
after the grantor's death, which is necessary to distribute a decedent's property when they leave a last will or have no estate plan at all.
Irrevocable trust funds can reduce or eliminate the amount of estate taxes owed after the grantor dies.
Trusts can be named as the
beneficiary of an individual retirement account (IRA)
but they'll be subject to accelerated withdrawal requirements and short-circuit
spousal inheritance provisions
.
2
3
Revocable Trust Funds vs. Irrevocable Trust Funds
All trust funds are either revocable or irrevocable. Both are referred to as
""living"" trusts
when the grantor creates them during their lifetime. A ""testamentary"" trust is one that's created after the grantor's death, usually under terms left in a last will. It's irrevocable because the grantor is no longer living to make changes to it.
4
Revocable Trust Fund
The grantor can change the terms of a
revocable trust
at any time or even dissolve and undo the trust completely if they choose. Assets funded or placed into a revocable trust can be transferred to any number of designated beneficiaries after the grantor's death or even during their lifetime.
5
The primary benefit of a revocable trust is that the assets avoid probate after the grantor's death. This leads to the quick distribution of assets to the named beneficiaries. The terms of a revocable trust aren't made public like those of a last will so an estate can be distributed with a high level of privacy.
Important
Grantors can act as their own trustees when they form a revocable trust or they can appoint someone else to the role. They can name a successor trustee to take over management of the revocable trust after their death when the assets are typically distributed to beneficiaries and the revocable trust is dissolved.
Irrevocable Trust Fund
An
irrevocable trust
fund is very difficult if not impossible to change or dissolve. Undoing it or its terms typically requires the unanimous consent of all beneficiaries.
This makes them virtually immune to estate taxes and creditor claims. The grantor of a revocable trust can take back assets they've placed into the trust at any time so they're still considered to personally own them. This isn't the case with an irrevocable trust. The grantor permanently gives up control and ownership of the assets and money placed into the trust although they set the terms as to the beneficiaries who will receive them and when.
3
Types of Trust Funds
Several types of trust funds are included under the umbrellas of revocable and irrevocable trusts. They often have different rules and stipulations depending on the assets involved and the beneficiaries. A tax or a trust attorney may be your best resource for understanding the intricacies of each of these vehicles. This isn't an exhaustive list.
Asset Protection:
This type of fund protects a person's assets from their creditors' future claims. Only an irrevocable trust can serve this purpose.
Blind:
This trust attempts to remove any hint of conflict of interest. The trust fund's grantor and beneficiaries have no knowledge of how the holdings are managed. The trustee has total control.
Charitable:
A charitable trust fund can benefit a particular charity or the general public. This includes a
Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT)
that pays a fixed amount each year. A Charitable Remainder Unitrust passes assets to a specified charity when the fund expires and gives the donor a charitable deduction as well as a fixed percentage of income to the beneficiary during the life of the trust fund.
6
Generation-Skipping:
This one provides tax benefits when the beneficiaries are the grantor’s grandchildren or anyone who's at least 37½ years younger than the grantor.
7
Grantor Retained Annuity:
Establishing this type of fund allows the grantor to transfer any appreciation of assets to any beneficiaries to minimize estate taxes.
Individual Retirement Account:
Trustees control IRA distributions rather than the beneficiaries.
Land:
This allows for the management of property, such as land, a home, or another type of real estate.
Marital:
This is
funded at one spouse's death
and is eligible for the unlimited marital deduction.
Medicaid:
Designed to allow individuals to set aside assets as gifts to their beneficiaries, this allows the grantor to qualify for long-term care under Medicaid. It's irrevocable.
Qualified Personal Residence:
An individual can move their residence from their estate to this type of fund to reduce the amount of gift tax incurred.
Qualified Terminable Interest Property:
This one benefits a surviving spouse but allows the grantor to make decisions after the surviving spouse’s passing.
Special Needs:
People who receive government benefits are the beneficiaries of this type of trust. The trust provides financial support in such a way so as not to disqualify them from government benefits. Some strict rules apply. A special needs trust must also be irrevocable.
Spendthrift:
Beneficiaries' access to assets is limited with this type of trust. Money and assets are released to them incrementally. The trustee is granted discretion as to when to transfer inheritances to them and how much. This safeguards against the beneficiaries' creditors and/or their",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust-fund.asp

Keynesian economics is a theory that explains how an economy's total spending affects output, employment, and inflation.
What Is Keynesian Economics?
Keynesian economics is a macroeconomic theory of total spending in the economy and how it affects output, employment, and inflation. It was developed by British economist John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to deal with the effects of the Great Depression.
The central belief of Keynesian economics is that government intervention can stabilize the economy. Keynes’ theory was the first to sharply separate the study of economic behavior and individual incentives from the study of broad aggregate variables and constructs.
Based on his theory, Keynes advocated for increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the Depression.
Subsequently, Keynesian economics was used to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance could be achieved—and economic
slumps
could be prevented—by influencing aggregate demand through economic intervention by the government.
Keynesian economists believe that such intervention can result in full employment and price stability.

Key Takeaways
Keynesian economics advocates using active government policy to manage aggregate demand to address or prevent economic recessions.
The thrust of Keynesian economics is that government intervention can support and strengthen the economy.
John Maynard Keynes
developed his theories in response to the Great Depression.
He was highly critical of previous economic theories, which he referred to as classical economics.
Activist fiscal and monetary policies are the primary tools recommended by Keynesian economists to manage the economy and fight unemployment.
Jessica Olah / Investopedia
Understanding Keynesian Economics
Keynesian economics represented a new way of looking at spending, output, and inflation. Previously,
classical economic thinking
held that cyclical swings in employment and economic output create profit opportunities that individuals and entrepreneurs would have an incentive to pursue. In so doing, they would correct imbalances in the
economy
.
According to Keynes’ view of this so-called classical theory, if
aggregate demand
in the economy fell, the resulting weakness in production and jobs would precipitate a decline in prices and wages. A lower level of
inflation
and wages would induce employers to make capital investments and employ more people, stimulating employment and restoring
economic growth
.
1
However, Keynes believed that the depth and persistence of the
Great Depression
severely tested this hypothesis.
1
Disagreement with Classical Economics
In his book “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” and other works, Keynes argued against this construct of classical theory, asserting that, during
recessions
, business pessimism and certain characteristics of market economies would exacerbate economic weakness and cause aggregate demand to plunge further than it already had.
1
For example, Keynesian economics disputes the notion held by some economists that lower wages can restore
full employment
because labor demand curves slope downward like any other normal demand curve.
1
Similarly, poor business conditions may cause companies to reduce
capital investment
rather than take advantage of lower prices to invest in new plants and equipment. This also would have the effect of reducing overall expenditures and employment.

John Maynard Keynes (Source: Public Domain).
Keynesian Economics and the Great Depression
Keynesian economics is sometimes referred to as “depression economics,” as Keynes’ “General Theory” was written during a time of deep depression—not only in his native United Kingdom, but worldwide.
The famous 1936 book was informed by Keynes’ understanding of events arising during the Great Depression, which Keynes believed could not be explained by classical economic theory as he portrayed it in his book.
Keynes’ Growing Belief in Government Intervention
Other economists had argued that, in the wake of any widespread downturn in the economy, businesses and investors taking advantage of lower input prices in pursuit of their own self-interest would return output and prices to a state of
equilibrium
, unless otherwise prevented from doing so. Keynes believed that the Great Depression seemed to counter this theory.
Output was low, and unemployment remained high during this time. The Great Depression inspired Keynes to think differently about the nature of the economy. From these theories, he established real-world applications that could have implications for a society in economic crisis.
Keynes rejected the idea that the economy would return to a natural state of equilibrium. Instead, he argued that, once an economic downturn sets in, for whatever reason, the fear and gloom that it engenders among businesses and investors will tend to become self-fulfilling and can lead to a sustained period of depressed economic activity and unemployment.
In response to this, Keynes advocated a countercyclical fiscal policy by which, during periods of economic woe, the government should undertake
deficit spending
to make up for the decline in investment and boost consumer spending to
stabilize aggregate demand
.
2
Criticism of Existing Government Policy and Personal Saving
Keynes was highly critical of the British government at the time.
3
The government greatly increased welfare spending and raised taxes to balance the national books. Keynes said that this would not encourage people to spend their money, thereby leaving the economy unstimulated and unable to recover and return to a successful state.
Keynes also criticized the idea of excessive saving, unless it was for a specific purpose such as retirement or education. He saw it as dangerous for the economy, because more money sitting stagnant meant less money in the economy stimulating growth.
4
This view was tied to another of Keynes’ theories geared toward preventing deep economic depressions.
Many economists have criticized Keynes’ approach. They argue that businesses responding to economic incentives will tend to return the economy to a state of equilibrium unless the government prevents them from doing so by interfering with prices and wages, and making it appear as though the market is self-regulating.
On the other hand, Keynes, who was writing while the world was mired in a long-standing period of deep economic depression, was not as optimistic about the natural equilibrium of the market. He believed that the government was in a better position than market forces when it came to creating a robust economy.
Fast Fact
Keynes proposed that the government spend more money and cut taxes, which would increase consumer demand in the economy. This would, in turn, lead to an increase in overall economic activity and a reduction in unemployment.
2
Keynesian Economics and Fiscal Policy
The
multiplier effect
, developed by Keynes’ student Richard Kahn, is one of the chief components of Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy.
According to Keynes’ theory of fiscal
stimulus
, an injection of government spending eventually leads to added business activity and even more spending. This theory proposes that spending boosts aggregate output and generates more income. If workers are willing to spend their extra income, the resulting growth in
gross domestic product (GDP)
could be even greater than the initial stimulus amount.
5
Keynesian Multiplier
The magnitude of the Keynesian multiplier is directly related to the marginal propensity to consume. Spending by consumers becomes income for businesses that then spend on equipment, worker wages, energy, materials, purchased services, taxes, and investor returns. Workers’ income can then be spent, and the cycle continues.
Keynes and his followers believed that individuals should save less and spend more, raising their
marginal propensity to consume
to effect full employment and economic growth.
Alternate Views
Keynes’ fiscal stimulus theory was the dominant paradigm in academic economics for decades. Eventually, though, other economists, such as
Milton Friedman
and
Murray Rothbard
, showed that the Keynesian model misrepresented the relatio",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp

A stop-limit order is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at the limit price, but only if the stop price has been reached.
What Is a Stop-Limit Order?
A stop-limit order is a conditional trade over a set time frame that combines the features of stop with those of a limit order and is used to mitigate risk. It is related to other order types, including limit orders (an order to either buy or sell a specified number of shares at a given price or better) and stop-on-quote orders (an order to either buy or sell a security after its price has surpassed a specified point).
Key Takeaways
Stop-limit orders are a conditional trade that combine the features of a stop loss with those of a limit order to mitigate risk.
Stop-limit orders enable traders to have precise control over when the order should be filled, but they are not guaranteed to be executed.
The stop price dictates the price whether the order is triggered, then the limit price dictates the price at which the order is filled.
Stop-limit orders offer risk management, automation, and flexibility in trading, though they do not protect against price gaps and are slightly more complex to set.
Traders often use stop-limit orders to lock in profits or limit downside losses.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
How Stop-Limit Orders Work
The primary benefit of a stop-limit order is that the
trader
has precise control over when the order should be filled. The
downside
, as with all limit orders, is that
the trade is not guaranteed
to be executed if the stock/commodity does not reach the stop price during the specified time period.
A stop-limit order requires the setting of two price points: the stop price and the limit price. First, set the stop price, which is the price that will trigger the trade. If the price of the security reaches the stop price, the trade will be triggered.
Then, set the limit price. The limit price is the worst price that you are willing to accept to buy or sell the security. For a buy order, the limit is the maximum price you want to pay for the trade. For sell orders, it is the minimum price that you are willing to receive. You will also need to set a time frame and the number of shares that you want to trade.
The stop-limit order will be executed at a specified price, or better after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a
limit order
to buy or sell at the limit price or better. This type of order is an available option with nearly every
online broker
.

It's important to note that stop-limit orders do not guarantee that your trade will be executed. If the price of the security drops quickly or there is a gap in trading, the order may not be filled at the desired limit price or at all.
1
This may result in missed opportunities for profit should the appropriate prices not be targeted.
Features of Stop and Limit Orders
A
stop order
is an order that becomes executable once a set price has been reached and is then filled at the current market price. A traditional stop order will be filled in its entirety, regardless of any changes in the current market price as the trades are completed.
A limit order is one that is set at a certain price. It is only executable at times when the trade can be performed at the limit price or at a price that is considered more favorable than the limit price. If trading activity causes the price to become unfavorable regarding the limit price, then the activity related to the order will be ceased. By combining the two orders, the investor has much greater precision in executing the trade.
A stop order is filled
at the market
price after the stop price has been hit, regardless of whether the price changes to an unfavorable position. This can lead to trades being completed at less than desirable prices should the market adjust quickly. Combining the stop order with the features of a limit order ensures that the order will not get filled once the pricing becomes unfavorable, based on the investor’s limit.
Thus, in a stop-limit order, after the stop price is triggered, the limit order takes effect to ensure that the order is not completed unless the price is at or better than the limit price that the investor has specified.

Tip
Stop-limit orders are free for most brokers; make sure you understand your broker's fee structure before setting orders to avoid unexpected fees.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Stop-Limit Orders
Pros of Stop-Limit Orders
There are several reasons why traders may rely heavily on stop-limit orders, as there are a handful of strong benefits of the order.
Price Control:
With a stop-limit order, you can control the price at which you enter or exit a trade. This means that you can set a limit price that is higher or lower than the stop price, depending on whether you are buying or selling. This gives investors greater control over the execution price and helps traders avoid getting filled at a price that is unfavorable.
Risk Management
:
Stop-limit orders are an effective way to manage risk. By setting a stop price, investors can limit their losses if the market moves against them. By setting a limit price, you can ensure that you don't get filled at a price that is too high or too low. This allows investors to control their risk and minimize their losses.
Automation:
Once you place a stop-limit order, it will automatically be executed when the stop price is reached. This means that you don't have to monitor the market constantly and can let the order execute on its own. This can be especially useful for traders who cannot monitor the market or want a more passive style of trading.
Flexibility:
Stop-limit orders can be used in a variety of trading strategies including day trading, swing trading, and position trading. They can be used to enter or exit a trade, and they can be used for both long and short positions. This flexibility makes stop-limit orders a versatile tool for traders regardless of the style of trading that investor wants to adopt.
Cons of Stop-Limit Orders
Though stop-limit orders have a suite of strong uses, there are also drawbacks to the product.
Uncertainty:
While a stop-limit order can help you control the price at which you enter or exit a trade, there is no guarantee that the order will be filled. If the market moves quickly and the price never reaches your limit price, your order may not be executed at all. This can be especially problematic in fast-moving markets where prices can fluctuate rapidly.
Price Gaps:
Another potential disadvantage of stop-limit orders is that they may not protect you against
price gaps
. A price gap occurs when the price of a security jumps from one level to another without any trades occurring in between. If this happens and your limit price is not met, you may end up getting filled at a price that is much worse than you anticipated.
Psychological Pressure:
Stop-limit orders can also create psychological pressure on traders. When a stop-loss is triggered, it can be tempting to hold on to the position in the hope that the market will reverse and the price will come back up. This can lead to indecision and emotional trading, which can be harmful and detrimental to a broader trading strategy.
Complexity:
Stop-limit orders can be more complex to set up and execute than other types of orders. Compared to market orders or limit orders, there are more factors, considerations, and inputs needed when setting the order. Traders need to be familiar with the process of setting a stop price and a limit price, and they need to understand how these prices interact with the market.
Pros
Allows investors to largely control the price in which they enter or exit a trade
Allows investors to ensure an order doesn't get filled at too high or low of a price, mitigating some trading risk
May allows for a more passive, automated style of trading
May be used in a variety of trading situations
Cons
May not execute if the price never meets the limit price
Does not offer protection against price gaps, potentially resulting in worse order fills than expected
May create pressure to hold onto positions
Are more complex to set up compared to other types of orders
Stop-Limit Order vs. Stop-Loss Order
Both a stop-limit order and a stop-loss order are useful for traders trying to manage risk. There are key difference between the two that change the situation where each may be best. First, a stop-loss order becomes a market order when the price of the security hits or falls below the stop price. This means that the order will be executed at the best available market price which may be different from the stop price. In contrast, a stop-limit order becomes a limit order when the stop price is reached, and will only be executed at the limit price or better. Therefore, the two have different execution points.

It allowed any adult citizen or intended citizen, who had never borne arms against the U.S. government, to claim 160 acres of surveyed government land. Claimants had to live on and cultivate the land.
1
Additional homesteading laws were passed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ended homesteading, except for Alaska, which allowed homesteading until 1986.
How to Qualify for Homestead Exemption
The homestead tax exemption can provide surviving spouses with ongoing property tax relief on a graduated scale so homes with lower
assessed values
benefit the most. The homestead exemption is designed to offer both physical shelter and financial protection, blocking the forced sale of a
primary residence
.
Individuals may apply for a homestead property tax exemption if they have a primary residence and want to reduce the overall property tax bill associated with that residence. Some states offer the exemption to every homeowner, while others require individuals to meet certain criteria such as:
An individual with a disability
An older adult
A veteran
A law enforcement official or first responder with a disability
Warning
The homestead exemption doesn’t prevent or stop a bank foreclosure if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage.
Homestead Exemptions by State
Some homestead exemptions are based on a flat reduction of all of the taxable value of your home. A percentage calculates other homestead property tax exemptions. Lower-valued homes receive a larger reduction using the first method. The latter is a better choice for people with high-value properties.
A version of the homestead exemption provision is found in every state or territory with some exceptions, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. However, how the
exemption
is applied and how much protection it affords against creditors varies by state. The homestead exemption is an automatic benefit in some states, but homeowners must file a claim with the state to receive it in others.
2
Protection From Creditors
A few states, including Florida and Texas, afford unlimited financial protection against unsecured creditors for the home, although acreage limits may apply for the protected property. A limit for protection from creditors can range from $5,000 to $550,000, depending on the state.
3
2
The protection limits are not for the home’s value but for the homeowner’s
equity
. A homeowner can’t be forced to sell the property to benefit creditors if the equity held is less than the limit, but creditors may force the sale If a homestead’s equity exceeds the limits.
4
Important
Protection doesn’t apply to secured creditors, such as the bank that holds the
mortgage
. The homeowner is protected only from
unsecured creditors
who may come after the home’s value to satisfy claims against the homeowner’s assets.
5
Bankruptcy Protection
Federal bankruptcy law shields a home from sale if the owner’s equity does not exceed $25,150 if the bankruptcy case was filed after April 1, 2019.
6
7
Homeowners commonly use the state’s limits, which often prove more favorable.
Those who declare bankruptcy in New Jersey or Pennsylvania can get protection using the federal limits despite the absence of a state homestead exemption in these states. But bankruptcy protection only protects against unsecured creditors. It won’t prevent a bank that holds a mortgage from foreclosing on the home.
5
Deducting the Homestead Exemption
A homestead tax or property tax is typically applied to homes based on the assessed value by the local government tax assessor’s office. The homestead tax can be a percentage of the property’s value or a fixed amount. The homestead exemption may offer ongoing reductions in property taxes depending on state laws.
Homestead tax exemptions usually offer a fixed discount on taxes, such as exempting the first $50,000 of the assessed value with the remainder taxed at the normal rate. With a $50,000 homestead exemption, a home valued at $150,000 would be taxed on only $100,000 of assessed value. A home valued at $75,000 would be taxed on only $25,000.
Fixed homestead tax exemptions create a
progressive tax
that’s more favorable for those with modest homes. The exemption is paid for with a local or state sales tax in some areas.
8
Do Homestead Exemptions Only Apply to a Primary Residence?
Homeowners must occupy the property as their permanent residence to qualify for a homestead exemption.
Where Do Individuals Apply for a Homestead Exemption?
A county or local tax assessor’s website or office will provide details on available homestead tax exemptions. Some states require an application, available online, and have deadlines.
What States Have Homestead Exemptions?
Most states have homestead exemptions except New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Some states have other homestead laws such as provisions that protect surviving spouses from creditors.
The Bottom Line
The homestead exemption provides an exemption from property taxes on a primary residence and protects the value from creditors, and circumstances that arise from the death of the homeowner’s spouse. The exemption can’t be claimed for another property elsewhere. Homestead protection is automatic in some states, but homeowners must file a claim for a homestead exemption in others.

What Are Tranches?
Tranches are segments created from a pool of securities—usually debt instruments such as bonds or mortgages—that are divided up by risk, time to maturity, or other characteristics in order to be marketable to different investors. Each portion or tranche of a securitized or structured product is one of several related securities offered at the same time, but with varying risks, rewards, and maturities to appeal to a diverse range of investors.
Tranche is a French word meaning
slice
or
portion
. They are commonly found in
mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
or
asset-backed securities (ABS)
.
Key Takeaways
Tranches are pieces of a pooled collection of securities, usually debt instruments, that are split up by risk or other characteristics in order to be marketable to different investors.
Tranches carry different maturities, yields, and degrees of risk—and privileges in repayment in case of default.
Tranches are common in securitized products like CDOs and CMOs.
Investopedia / Jake Shi
Understanding Tranches
Tranches in
structured finance
are a fairly recent development, spurred by the increased use of
securitization
to divide up sometimes-risky financial products with steady cash flows to then sell these divisions to other investors. The discrete tranches of a larger asset pool are usually defined in transaction documentation and assigned different classes of notes, each with a different bond credit rating.
Senior tranches typically contain assets with higher credit ratings than junior tranches. The senior tranches have first lien on the assets—they're in line to be repaid first, in case of default. Junior tranches have a second lien or no lien at all.
Examples of financial products that can be divided into tranches include bonds, loans, insurance policies, mortgages, and other debts.
Tranches in Mortgage-Backed Securities
A tranche is a common financial structure for securitized debt products, such as a
collateralized debt obligation (CDO)
, which pools together a collection of cash flow-generating assets—such as mortgages, bonds, and loans—or a mortgage-backed security.
An MBS is made of multiple mortgage pools that have a wide variety of loans, from safe loans with lower interest rates to
risky loans with higher rates
. Each specific mortgage pool has its own time to maturity, which factors into the risk and reward benefits. Therefore, tranches are made to divide up the different mortgage profiles into slices that have financial terms suitable for specific investors.
For example, a
collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)
offering a partitioned mortgage-backed securities portfolio might have mortgage tranches with one-year, two-year, five-year, and 20-year maturities, all with varying yields. If an investor wants to buy an MBS, they can choose the tranche type most applicable to their appetite for return and aversion to risk.
A
Z tranche
is the lowest-ranked tranche of a CMO in terms of seniority. Its owners are not entitled to any coupon payments, receiving no cash flow from
underlying
mortgages
until the more senior tranches are retired, or paid off.
Investors receive monthly cash flow based on the MBS tranche in which they invested. They can either try to sell it and make a quick profit or hold onto it and realize small but long-term gains in the form of interest payments. These monthly payments are bits and pieces of all the interest payments made by homeowners whose mortgage is included in a specific MBS.
Investment Strategy in Choosing Tranches
Investors who desire to have long-term steady cash flow will invest in tranches with a longer time to maturity. Investors who need a more immediate but more lucrative income stream will invest in tranches with less time to maturity.
All tranches, regardless of interest and maturity, allow investors to customize investment strategies to their specific needs. Conversely, tranches help banks and other financial institutions attract investors across many different profile types.
Tranches add to the complexity of debt investing and sometimes pose a problem to uninformed investors, who run the risk of choosing tranches unsuitable to their investment goals.
Tranches can also be miscategorized by credit rating agencies. If they are given a higher rating than deserved, it can cause investors to be exposed to riskier assets than they intended to be. Such mislabeling played a part in the mortgage meltdown of 2007 and the subsequent financial crisis.
Tranches containing junk bonds or sub-prime mortgages (below-investment-grade assets) were labeled AAA or the equivalent, either through incompetence, carelessness, or, as some charged, outright corruption on the agencies' part.
Tranche Lawsuits in the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis
After the financial crisis of 2007-09, an explosion of lawsuits occurred against issuers of CMOs, CDOs, and other debt securities—and among investors in the products themselves, all of which was dubbed ""tranche warfare"" in the press.
An April 2008 story in the
Financial Times
noted that investors in the senior tranches of failed CDOs were taking advantage of their priority status to seize control of assets and cut off payments to other debt holders. CDO trustees, such as Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo, filed suits to ensure all tranche investors continued to receive funds.
1
And in 2009, the manager of Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund Carrington Investment Partners
filed a lawsuit
against the mortgage-servicing company American Home Mortgage Servicing. The hedge fund held junior tranches of mortgage-backed securities that contained loans made on foreclosed properties that American Home was selling for (allegedly) low prices—thus crippling the tranche's yield. Carrington argued in the complaint that its interests as a junior tranche-holder were in line with those of the senior tranche-holders.
2
What Are the Three Types of Tranches?
Pooled financial securities are generally broken into three tranches: senior, mezzanine, and junior. Each tranche has a different level of risk and, therefore, a different level of return. Senior tranches have the least risk and the lowest returns while junior tranches have the highest risk and the highest returns. Mezzanine tranches sit between the two.
What Is an Example of a Tranche?
An example of a tranche is as follows. Hundreds of mortgages are pooled into a security: a mortgage-backed security (MBS). The mortgages in this security all have different credit profiles based on the holder of the mortgage. Some have excellent credit profiles and the mortgages, therefore, have low interest rates.
Some of the borrowers have bad credit profiles and their mortgages have high interest rates. These different mortgages are broken down into tranches. Each tranche represents a different credit profile. The low-risk mortgages go into the senior tranche whereas the high-risk mortgages go into the junior tranche. An investor can choose which tranche they would like to invest in based on their risk profile.
Is a CMO a CDO?
A collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) constructed of underlying mortgages. CDOs are a pooled investment security of any fixed-income asset but are most often made up of loans. A CMO is specifically a CDO where the loans are mortgages.
What Is a AAA Tranche?
Most pooled fixed-income investments consist of tranches, each assigned with a credit rating. Tranches assigned a AAA rating are of the best quality, meaning they are the least risky but also will have the lowest return. Sometimes a large corporation, project or sovereign government may require large amounts of funds. Banks may work together to offer funds and create
pro-rata tranches
. Pro-rata tranches will also have a credit rating assigned to it.
The Bottom Line
Tranches allow investors to choose the level of risk and return when investing in pooled securities. Those seeking higher returns will opt for higher-risk tranches, such as those containing below-investment-grade securities. Those seeking safer returns will opt for investment-grade tranches.

Definition
Magna cum laude is a Latin phrase that means “with great praise.""
What Is Magna Cum Laude?
Magna cum laude is a term used in academics to acknowledge that a student graduated with a grade point average (GPA) near the top of the class. In the U.S., there are three levels of academic distinction or Latin honors.
Cum laude
, meaning ""with distinction,"" magna cum laude, or ""with great praise,"" and
summa cum laude
, or ""with highest distinction.""
Key Takeaways
Each college or university determines the GPA that earns the magna cum laude distinction.
Latin honors are most commonly awarded with bachelor's degrees.
High schools may also grant Latin honors using the same phrasing.
Criteria
The awarding of Latin honors is common in colleges and universities in the United States. Latin honors are commonly awarded with bachelor's degrees. Students who graduate with honors may wear stoles of a distinct color or some other designation during commencement ceremonies, and their honors may be cited when their names are read. Magna cum laude is more prestigious than cum laude honors but less prestigious than summa cum laude.
1
Each institution defines the criteria. Some use GPA while others calculate their honors according to class placement. For example, a student in the top 3% of the class might qualify for a magna cum laude distinction. Colleges may consider other factors in their decisions to grant magna cum laude status.
An institution might require that students complete an honors thesis to be eligible. Others seek letters of recommendation from faculty members. Some may require students to complete a certain number of advanced courses.
Fast Fact
Latin honors are generally noted in a student’s official transcript.
Examples
Texas A&M graduates must complete 60 credit hours while earning a GPA of 3.70 to 3.899 to earn a magna cum laude degree.
2
A student graduating magna cum laude in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, must finish in the top 5% to 10% of the class after completing 90 credits. For the 2024–2025 academic year, students must achieve a 3.938 GPA.
3
Brown University does not use a student’s GPA in its calculation since the school does not calculate GPAs. Students are eligible for just one Latin honor, magna cum laude, upon graduation by earning a high percentage of A grades and S for distinction marks for courses, as well as meeting other criteria as determined by the school. No more than 20% of a graduating class can earn magna cum laude honors.
4
What Other Honors Do Universities or Colleges Use?
Some schools have substituted other titles, such as “with distinction,” in place of or in addition to the traditional Latin terms.
Is Magna Cum Laude Important for Graduates?
The relative value of a magna cum laude degree or another Latin honor is difficult to judge as a factor in the job market. It may mean a great deal to some employers and nothing to others. It may benefit students competing for slots in graduate school. The top law schools, for example, expect students to have achieved certain GPAs as undergraduates—the type of high marks that are often accompanied by Latin honors.
What Do Latin Honors Indicate?
Graduating with honors notes that an individual has shown exemplary performance at school, particularly in academics. It indicates that an individual is capable of performing at the highest level.
The Bottom Line
A college degree is a great achievement, but a new graduate with honors may stand out in a crowded field of job seekers or graduate school applicants. Latin honors such as a magna cum laude distinction indicate a student has consistently performed at a high level.

Investopedia,Jurisdiction Risk,"Close
What Is Jurisdiction Risk?
Jurisdiction risk refers to the risks that can arise when operating in a foreign country or jurisdiction. These risks can arise simply by doing business, or else by lending or borrowing money in another country. Risks could also stem from legal, regulatory, or political factors that exist in different countries or regions.
In recent times, jurisdiction risk has focused increasingly on banks and financial institutions that are exposed to the volatility that some of the countries where they operate may be high-risk areas for money laundering and terrorism financing.
1
Key Takeaways
Jurisdiction risk is associated with operating in a foreign country or region.
Jurisdiction risk can also be applied to times when an investor is exposed to unexpected changes in the laws.
The U.S. government advises financial institutions to refer to updates from the Financial Action Task Force to identify potentially risky jurisdictions with weak measures to fight money laundering and terrorist financing.
2
How Jurisdiction Risk Works
Jurisdiction risk is any additional risk that arises from borrowing and lending or doing business in a foreign country. This risk can also refer to times when laws unexpectedly change in an area in which an investor has exposure. This type of jurisdiction risk can often lead to added price volatility. As a result, the added risk from volatility means investors will demand higher returns to offset the higher levels of risk being faced.
Important
Political risk
is a form of jurisdiction risk whereby an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting
investment
returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers, or military control.
Some of the risks associated with jurisdiction risk that banks, investors, and companies may face include
legal complications
,
exchange rate
risks, and even
geopolitical risks
.
As mentioned above, jurisdiction risk has recently become synonymous with countries where money laundering and terrorist activities are high. These activities are generally believed to be prevalent in countries that are designated as non-cooperative by the
Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) or are identified by the
U.S. Treasury
as requiring special measures due to concerns about money laundering or corruption.
3
4
Because of the punitive fines and penalties that can be levied against a financial institution that is involved—even inadvertently—in money laundering or financing terrorism, most organizations have specific processes to assess and mitigate jurisdiction risk.
Special Considerations
The FATF publishes two documents publicly three times a year and has done so since 2000. These reports identify areas of the world that the FATF declares have weak efforts to combat both money laundering and terrorist financing. These countries are called Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs).
4
As of June 2021, the FATF listed the following 22 countries as monitored jurisdictions: Albania, Barbados, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cayman Islands, Haiti, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.
5
These NCCTs have deficiencies when it comes to placing
anti-money laundering
policies, as well as recognizing and fighting terrorist financing. But they have all committed to working with the FATF to address the deficiencies.
The FATF placed both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (i.e., North Korea) and Iran on its call-to-action list. According to the FATF, North Korea still poses a great risk to international finance because of its lack of commitment and deficiencies in the noted areas. The FATF also indicated its concern over the country's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The organization noted Iran outlined its commitment to the FATF but has failed to enact its plan.
6
1
Examples of Jurisdiction Risk
Investors may experience jurisdiction risk in the form of
foreign exchange risk
(also known as currency risk). So, an international financial transaction may be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange. This can lead to a drop in the value of an investment. Foreign exchange risks can be mitigated by using hedging strategies including options and forward contracts.

What Is a Line of Credit (LOC)?
A line of credit (LOC) is a preset borrowing limit offered by banks and financial institutions to their personal and business customers. Lines of credit can be used at any time until the limit is reached. The limit is set by the issuer based on the borrower's
creditworthiness
. As money is repaid, it can be borrowed again in the case of an open line of credit. The borrower can access funds from the LOC at any time as long as they do not exceed the maximum amount (or
credit limit
) set in the agreement.
Key Takeaways
A line of credit is a preset borrowing limit that a borrower can draw on at any time that the line of credit is open.
Types of credit lines include personal, business, and home equity, among others.
The built-in flexibility of a line of credit is its main advantage.
Potential downsides include high interest rates, late payments penalties, and the potential to overspend.
Investopedia / Julie Bang
Understanding Lines of Credit (LOCs)
A line of credit is a
credit
product that banks and other financial institutions offer their customers. They are available for both personal customers and business clients. Like other credit products, customers must qualify to be approved for a line of credit. Customers may apply for or be pre-approved for a credit line. The limit on the LOC is based on the borrower's creditworthiness.
All LOCs consist of a
set amount of money that can be borrowed
as needed, paid back, and borrowed again. The amount of interest, size of payments, and other rules are set by the lender. Some LOCs allow you to write checks, while others issue a debit card that can be used to access the available credit. A line of credit can be
secured or unsecured
. Secured LOCs come with lower rates as they are backed by collateral while unsecured LOCs typically come with higher rates.
The LOC is highly flexibility, which is its main advantage. Borrowers can request a certain amount, but they do not have to use it all. Rather, they can tailor their spending from the LOC to their needs and owe
interest
only on the amount that they draw, not on the entire credit line. In addition, borrowers can adjust their repayment amounts as needed based on their budget or cash flow. They can repay, for example, the entire outstanding balance all at once or just make the minimum monthly payments.
There are different types of LOCs that financial institutions offer. Some of the most common types of LOCs include personal, business, and
home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)
. We explore these in more detail below.
Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020
Unsecured vs. Secured Lines of Credit (LOCs)
Most LOCs are
unsecured loans
. This means that the borrower does not promise the lender any
collateral
to back the LOC. One notable exception is a
home equity line of credit (HELOC)
, which is secured by the
equity in the borrower’s home
. From the lender’s perspective, secured LOCs are attractive because they provide a way to recoup the advanced funds in the event of nonpayment.
1
For individuals or business owners, secured LOCs are attractive because they typically come with a higher maximum credit limit and significantly lower interest rates than unsecured LOCs. Unsecured LOCs are also more difficult to obtain and often require a higher
credit score
or
credit rating
.
Lenders attempt to compensate for the increased
risk
by limiting how much can be borrowed and by charging higher interest rates. That is one reason why the
annual percentage rate (APR)
on credit cards is so high.
Credit cards are technically unsecured LOCs, with the credit limit—how much you can charge on the card—representing its parameters. But you do not pledge any assets when you open the card. If you start missing payments, there’s nothing that the credit card issuer can seize in compensation.
Important
An LOC can have a major impact on your credit score. In general, if you use more than 30% of the borrowing limit, your credit score will drop.
2
Revolving vs. Non-Revolving Lines of Credit (LOCs)
An LOC is often considered to be a type of revolving account, also known as an
open-end credit
account. This arrangement allows borrowers to spend the money, repay it, and spend it again in a virtually never-ending, revolving cycle. Revolving accounts such as
LOCs and credit cards are different from installment loans
such as mortgages and car loans.
With
installment loans
, consumers borrow a set amount of money and repay it in equal monthly installments until the loan is paid off. Once an installment loan has been paid off, consumers cannot spend the funds again unless they apply for a new loan.
Non-revolving LOCs have the same features as revolving credit (or a revolving LOC). A credit limit is established, funds can be used for a variety of purposes, interest is charged normally, and payments may be made at any time. There is one major exception: The pool of available credit does not replenish after payments are made. Once you pay off the LOC in full, the account is closed and cannot be used again.
As an example, personal LOCs are sometimes offered by banks in the form of an
overdraft
protection plan. A banking customer can sign up to have an overdraft plan linked to their checking account. If the customer goes over the amount available in checking, the overdraft keeps them from bouncing a check or having a purchase denied. Like any LOC, an overdraft must be paid back, with interest.
Types of Lines of Credit (LOCs)
LOCs come in a variety of forms, with each falling into either the secured or unsecured category. Beyond that, each type of LOC has its own characteristics.
Personal Line of Credit (LOC)
This provides access to unsecured funds that can be borrowed, repaid, and borrowed again. Opening a personal LOC usually requires a
credit history
of no defaults, a credit score of 670 or higher, and reliable income.
Having savings helps, as does collateral in the form of stocks or
certificates of deposit (CDs)
, though collateral is not required for a personal LOC. Personal LOCs are used for emergencies, weddings,
overdraft protection
, travel, and entertainment, and to help smooth out bumps for those with irregular income.
Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)
HELOCs are the most common type of secured LOC. A HELOC is secured by the
market value of the home
minus the amount owed, which becomes the basis for determining the size of the LOC. Typically, the credit limit is equal to 75% or 80% of the market value of the home, minus the balance owed on the mortgage.
HELOCs often come with a
draw period
(usually 10 years) during which the borrower can access available funds, repay them, and borrow again. After the draw period, the balance is due, or a loan is extended to pay off the balance over time.
3
HELOCs typically have closing costs, including the cost of an
appraisal
on the property used as collateral.
Fast Fact
Since the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)
of 2017, interest paid on a HELOC is only deductible if the funds
are used to “buy, build or substantially improve” the property that serves as collateral for the HELOC.
4
Business Line of Credit
Businesses use these to borrow on an as-needed basis instead of taking out a fixed loan. The financial institution extending the LOC evaluates the market value, profitability, and risk taken on by the business and extends an LOC based on that evaluation. The LOC may be unsecured or secured, depending on the size of the LOC requested and the evaluation results. As with almost all LOCs,
the interest rate is variable
.
Demand Line of Credit (LOC)
This type can be either secured or unsecured but is rarely used. With a demand LOC, the lender can call the amount borrowed due at any time. Payback (until the loan is called) can be interest only or interest plus
principal
, depending on the terms of the LOC. The borrower can spend up to the credit limit at any time.
Securities-Backed Line of Credit (SBLOC)
This is a special secured-demand LOC, in which collateral is provided by the borrower’s
securities
. Typically, an SBLOC lets the investor borrow anywhere from 50% to 95% of the value of assets in their account. SBLOCs are
non-purpose
loans, meaning that the borrower may not use the money to buy or trade securities. Almost any other type of expenditure is allowed.
SBLOCs require the borrower to make monthly, interest-only payments until the loan is repaid in full or the brokerage or bank demands payment, which can happen if the value of the investor’s
portfolio
falls below the level of the LOC.
Limitations of Lines of Credit (LOC)
The main advantage of an LOC is the ability to borrow only the amount needed and avoid paying interest on a large loan. That said, borrowers need to
be aware of potential problems
when taking out an LOC.
Unsecured LOCs
have higher interest rates
and credit requirements than those secured by collateral.
Interest rates for LOCs are almost always variable and vary widely from one lender to another.
LOCs do not provide the same regulatory protection as credit cards. Penalties for late payments and going over the LOC limit can be severe.
An open LOC can invite overspending, leading to an inability to make payments.
Misuse of an LOC can hurt a borrow",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp
Investopedia,Relative Strength Index (RSI) Indicator Explained With Formula,"Close
Definition
The RSI is a momentum oscillator that is widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a
momentum indicator
used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security.
The RSI is displayed as an
oscillator
(a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book,
New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.
1
In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition.
The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it is generally available on most trading platforms offered by
online stock brokers.
Key Takeaways
The relative strength index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator introduced in 1978.
The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and is often plotted below the graph of an asset’s price.
An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.
In some situations, the RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above the oversold line can be seen by traders as a signal to buy or sell.
The RSI works best in
trading ranges
rather than trending markets.
How the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Works
As a momentum indicator
, the relative strength index compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform.

The RSI, especially when
used in conjunction with other technical indicators
, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.

The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14.
4
For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%.
The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:

Plotting RSI
After the RSI is calculated, the RSI indicator can be plotted, usually beneath an asset’s price chart, as shown below. The RSI will rise as the number and size of up days increase. It will fall as the number and size of down days increase.
Tradingview
As you can see in the above chart, the RSI indicator can stay in the overbought region for extended periods while the stock is in an
uptrend
. The indicator may also remain in oversold territory for a long time when the stock is in a
downtrend
. This can be confusing for new analysts, but learning to use the indicator within the context of the prevailing trend will clarify these issues.
Why Is RSI Important?
Traders can use RSI to predict the price behavior of a security.
It can help traders validate trends and trend reversals.
It can point to overbought and oversold securities.
It can provide short-term traders with buy and sell signals.
It's a technical indicator that can be used with others to support trading strategies.
Using RSI With Trends
Modify RSI Levels to Fit Trends
The primary trend of the security is important to know to properly understand RSI readings. For example, well-known market technician Constance Brown, CMT, proposed that an oversold reading by the RSI in an uptrend is probably much higher than 30. Likewise, an overbought reading during a downtrend is much lower than 70.
5
As you can see in the following chart, during a downtrend, the RSI peaks near 50 rather than 70. This could be seen by traders as more reliably signaling bearish conditions.
Many investors create a horizontal
trendline
between the levels of 30 and 70 when a strong trend is in place to better identify the overall trend and extremes.
6
On the other hand, modifying overbought or oversold RSI levels when the price of a stock or asset is in a long-term horizontal channel or trading range (rather than a strong upward or downward trend) is usually unnecessary.
The relative strength indicator is not as reliable in
trending markets
as it is in trading ranges. In fact, most traders understand that the signals given by the RSI in strong upward or downward trends often can be false.
Use Buy and Sell Signals That Fit Trends
A related concept focuses on
trade signals
and techniques that conform to the trend. In other words, using bullish signals primarily when the price is in a bullish trend and bearish signals primarily when a stock is in a bearish trend may help traders avoid the false alarms that the RSI can generate in trending markets.
Tradingview
What Is a Bullish RSI Number?
A number of RSI levels can be considered bullish, depending on whether the market is trending up or down or is rangebound.
One bullish signal is when the RSI crosses below 30, where it would be considered
oversold
. But as noted above, bullish RSI signals are best used in uptrends. In a strong downtrend, the trend can continue well after momentum indicators have hit oversold levels. In addition, any trade entered on this signal may offer limited upside, since you’d likely be trading against a strong, recent trend.
Following a strong uptrend, another bullish RSI signal is a reversal after a decline to around 40-50, an area considered support during an uptrend. This is often confirmation of a positive momentum shift back toward the uptrend after a pullback, signaling potential for continued gains.
7
What Is a Bearish RSI Number?
Bearish signals from the RSI appear much like bullish ones but in reverse. A basic bearish signal is when the RSI crosses above 70, an
overbought
level. If this is followed by a move below 70, upward momentum may be weakening, alerting traders to a potential price reversal.
7
But again, bearish RSI signals are best used in downtrends.
During a strong downtrend, one bearish RSI signal is a reversal after a rise to around 50-60. This is often confirmation of a momentum shift back toward the downside after a pullback, signaling potential for continued declines.
Interpretation of RSI and RSI Ranges
During
trends
, the RSI readings may fall into a band or range. During a strong
uptrend
, the RSI tends to stay well above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a strong
downtrend
, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, while it frequently hits 30 or below.
3
These guidelines can help traders
determine trend strength and spot potential reversals. For example, if the RSI can’t reach 70 on a number of consecutive price swings during an uptrend, but then drops below 30, the trend is likely breaking down.
The opposite is true for a downtrend. If the downtrend is unable to reach 30 or below and then rallies above 70, that downtrend has broken down and could be reversing to the upside. Trend lines and
moving averages
are helpful technical tools to include when using the RSI in this way.
Tip
Be sure not to confuse RSI and relative strength. The first refers to changes in the price momentum of one security. The second compares the price performance of two or more securities.
2
Example of RSI Divergences
An RSI divergence occurs when the indicator and price begin to reach different levels, indicating a change in momentum that precedes a change in price direction. For example, a bullish
divergence
occurs when the security makes a lower low but the indicator forms a higher low. This indicates rising bullish momentum and could be used to trigger a new
long position
.
A bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher high but the RSI makes a lower high.
8
This indicates a possible shift to downside momentum.

Conflict theory is a sociopolitical framework, associated with Karl Marx, that explains societal dynamics as a struggle for limited resources.
What Is Conflict Theory?
Conflict theory, as associated with
Karl Marx
, is a social theory that posits that society is in a state of perpetual conflict because of competition for limited resources.
1
Conflict theory holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than by consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with
wealth and power
try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless. A basic premise of conflict theory is that individualcs and groups within society will work to try to maximize their own wealth and power.
1
Key Takeaways
Conflict theory focuses on competition among groups within society over limited resources.
Marxist conflict theory sees society as divided along lines of economic class between the proletarian working class and the bourgeois ruling class.
Conflict theory views social and economic institutions as tools in the struggle among groups or classes, used to maintain inequality and the dominance of the ruling class.
Later versions of conflict theory look at other dimensions of conflict among capitalist factions and among various social, religious, and other types of groups.
Theresa Chiechi / Investopedia
Understanding Conflict Theory
Philosophers and sociologists have long sought to use conflict theories to explain a wide range of phenomena, including wars, revolutions,
poverty
, discrimination, and domestic violence.
Marx’s version of conflict theory focused on the conflict between two primary classes. Each class consists of a group of people bound by mutual interests and a certain degree of property ownership. Marx theorized about the bourgeoisie, a group that represented members of society who hold the majority of the
wealth
and means. The proletariat is the other group, comprised of those considered
working-class
or poor.
With the rise of capitalism, Marx theorized that the
bourgeoisie
, a minority within the population, would use their influence to oppress the proletariat, the majority class. This way of thinking is tied to a common image associated with conflict theory-based models of society.
2
Adherents to this philosophy tend to believe in a pyramid arrangement in terms of how goods and services are distributed in society. At the top of the pyramid is a small group of elites that dictate terms and conditions to the larger portion of society because they have an outsized amount of control over resources and power.

Uneven distribution within society was predicted to be maintained through ideological coercion; the bourgeoisie would force acceptance of the current conditions by the proletariat. Conflict theory assumes that the elite will set up systems of laws, traditions, and other societal structures in order to further support their own dominance while preventing others from joining their ranks.
Marx theorized that, as the working class and poor were subjected to worsening conditions, a collective consciousness would raise more awareness about inequality, and this would potentially result in revolt. If, after the revolt, conditions were adjusted to favor the concerns of the proletariat, the conflict circle would eventually repeat but in the opposite direction. The bourgeoisie would eventually become the aggressor and revolter, grasping for the return of the structures that formerly maintained their dominance.
Special Considerations
Marx viewed capitalism as part of a historical progression of economic systems. He believed capitalism was rooted in
commodities
, or things that are purchased and sold. For example, he believed that labor is a type of commodity. Because laborers have little control or power in the economic system (because they don’t own factories or materials), their worth can be devalued over time. This can create an imbalance between business owners and their workers, which can eventually lead to social conflicts. He believed these problems would eventually be fixed through a social and economic revolution.
3
Adaptations of Marxist Conflict Theory
Max Weber, a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist, adapted many aspects of Marxist conflict theory and later further refined some of Marx's ideas.
4
Weber believed that conflict over property was not limited to one specific scenario. Rather, he believed that there were multiple layers of conflict existing at any given moment and in every society.
Whereas Marx framed his view of conflict as one between owners and workers, Weber also added an emotional component to his ideas about conflict.
5
Weber's beliefs about conflict extend beyond Marx's because they suggest that some forms of social interaction, including conflict, generate beliefs and solidarity between individuals and groups within a society. In this way, an individual's reactions to inequality might be different depending on the groups with which they are associated; whether they perceive those in power to be legitimate; and so on.
Conflict theorists of the later 20th and early 21st centuries have continued to extend conflict theory beyond the strict economic classes posited by Marx, although economic relations remain a core feature of the inequalities across groups in the various branches of conflict theory. Conflict theory is highly influential in modern and postmodern theories of sexual and racial inequality, peace and conflict studies, and the many varieties of identity studies that have arisen across Western academia in the past several decades.
Examples of Conflict Theory
Conflict theorists view the relationship between a housing complex owner and a tenant as being based mainly on conflict instead of balance or harmony, even though there may be more harmony than conflict. They believe that they are defined by getting whatever resources they can from each other.
In the above example, some of the limited resources that may contribute to conflicts between tenants and the complex owner include the limited space within the complex, the limited number of units, the money that tenants pay to the complex owner for rent, and so on. Ultimately, conflict theorists see this dynamic as one of conflict over these resources.
The complex owner, however gracious, is fundamentally focused on getting as many apartment units filled as possible so that they can make as much money in rent as possible, especially if bills such as
mortgages
and utilities must be covered. This may introduce conflict between housing complexes, among tenant applicants looking to move into an apartment, and so forth. On the other side of the conflict, the tenants themselves are looking to get the best apartment possible for the least amount of money in rent.
The
financial crisis
of 2008 and the subsequent bank bailouts are good examples of real-life conflict theory, according to authors Alan Sears and James Cairns in their book ""A Good Book, in Theory."" They view the financial crisis as the inevitable outcome of the inequalities and instabilities of the global economic system, which enable the largest banks and institutions to avoid government oversight and take huge risks that only reward a select few.
6
Sears and Cairns note that large
banks
and big businesses subsequently received bailout funds from the same governments that claimed to have insufficient funds for large-scale social programs such as universal healthcare.
6
This dichotomy supports a fundamental assumption of conflict theory, which is that mainstream political institutions and cultural practices favor dominant groups and individuals.
This example illustrates that conflict can be inherent in all types of relationships, including those that don't appear on the surface to be antagonistic. It also shows that even a straightforward scenario can lead to multiple layers of conflict.
What Is Conflict Theory?
Conflict theory is a sociopolitical theory that is heavily associated with Karl Marx. It seeks to explain political and economic events in terms of an ongoing struggle over finite resources. In this struggle, Marx emphasizes the antagonistic relationship between social classes, in particular the relationship betwe",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-theory.asp

Definition
Capitalism is an economic system where private individuals or businesses own capital goods, and the free market controls the production of goods and services.
What Is Capitalism?
Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals or businesses own capital goods. At the same time, business owners employ workers who receive only wages; labor doesn't own the means of production but instead uses them on behalf of the owners of capital.
The production of goods and services under capitalism is based on supply and demand in the general market, also known as the
market economy
. This is in contrast to a planned economy or a
command economy
, in which prices are set through central planning.
The purest form of capitalism is free-market or
laissez-faire
capitalism. Here, private individuals are unrestrained. They may determine where to invest, what to produce or sell, and at what prices to exchange goods and services. The laissez-faire marketplace operates without checks or controls. Today, most countries practice a mixed capitalist system that includes some degree of
government regulation
of business and some extent of public ownership of select industries.
1
Key Takeaways
Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production, with labor being paid solely in wages.
Capitalism depends on the enforcement of private property rights, which provide incentives for investment in and productive use of capital.
Capitalism developed out of feudalism and mercantilism in Europe, and dramatically expanded industrialization and the large-scale availability of mass-market consumer goods.
Pure capitalism can be contrasted with pure socialism, in which all means of production are collective or state-owned.
A capitalist society relies on the use of contracts, fair dealing, and tort law to facilitate and enforce private property rights.
Investopedia / Zoe Hansen
Understanding Capitalism
Capitalism is one type of system of economic production and resource distribution. Instead of planning economic decisions through centralized political methods, as with socialism or feudalism, economic planning under capitalism occurs via decentralized, competitive, and voluntary decisions.
Capitalism is essentially an economic system in which the means of production—factories, tools, machines, raw materials, and so on—are organized by one or more business owners, also known as capitalists. Capitalists then hire workers to operate the means of production in return for wages. Workers have no claim on the means of production or on the profits generated from their labor; these belong to the capitalists.

Thus, private
property rights
are fundamental to capitalism. Most modern concepts of private property stem from John Locke's theory of homesteading, in which individuals claim ownership by mixing their labor with previously unclaimed resources. Once owned, the only legitimate means of transferring property are through voluntary exchange, gifts,
inheritance
, or the re-homesteading of abandoned property.
2
Private property promotes efficiency by giving the owner of resources an incentive to maximize the value of their property. The more valuable a resource is, the more trading power it provides the owner. In a capitalist system, the person who owns the property is entitled to any value associated with that property.
Why Private Property Rights Matter for Capitalism
For individuals or businesses to deploy their capital goods confidently, a system must exist that protects their legal right to own or transfer private property. A capitalist society relies on the use of contracts, fair dealing, and
tort law
to facilitate and enforce these private property rights.
When
property
isn't privately owned but is shared by the public, a problem known as the
tragedy of the commons
can emerge. With a common pool resource, which all people can use and none can limit access to, all individuals have an incentive to extract as much use-value as they can and no incentive to conserve or reinvest in the resource. Privatizing the resource is one possible solution to this problem, along with various voluntary or involuntary collective action approaches.
3
Fast Fact
Under capitalist production, the business owners retain ownership of the goods being produced. If a worker in a shoe factory were to take home a pair of shoes that they made, it would be theft. This concept is known as the alienation of workers from their labor.
Capitalism and the Profit Motive
Profits
are closely associated with the concept of private property. By definition, an individual only enters into a voluntary exchange of private property when they believe the exchange benefits them in some psychic or material way. In such trades, each party gains extra subjective value, or profit, from the transaction.
The
profit motive
, or the desire to earn profits from business activity, is the driving force of capitalism. It creates a competitive environment in which businesses compete to be the low-cost producer of a certain good in order to gain market share. If it is more profitable to produce a different type of good, then a business is incentivized to switch.
4
Voluntary trade is another, related mechanism that drives activity in a capitalist system. The owners of resources compete with one another over consumers, who, in turn, compete with other consumers over goods and services. All this activity is built into the price system, which balances
supply and demand
to coordinate the distribution of resources.
1
A capitalist earns the highest profit by utilizing
capital goods
, such as machinery and tools, most efficiently while producing the highest-value goods or services. By contrast, the capitalist suffers losses when capital resources aren't used efficiently and instead create outputs of lesser value.
Important
Capitalism is a system of economic production. Markets are systems of distribution and allocation of goods already produced. While they often go hand-in-hand, capitalism and
free markets
refer to two distinct systems.
Precursors to Capitalism: Feudalism and Mercantilism
Capitalism is a relatively new type of social arrangement for producing goods in an economy. It arose largely along with the advent of the
Industrial Revolution
, sometime in the late 18th century.
5
Before capitalism, other systems of production and social organization were prevalent.
Feudalism and the Roots of Capitalism
Capitalism grew out of European feudalism. Up until the 12th century, a very small percentage of the population of Europe lived in towns. Skilled workers lived in the city but received their keep from feudal lords rather than a real wage, and most workers were serfs for titled nobles. However, by the late Middle Ages, rising urbanism, with cities as centers of industry and trade, became more and more economically important.
Under feudalism, society was segmented into social classes based on birth or family lineage. Lords (nobility) were the landowners, while serfs (peasants and laborers) didn't own land but were under the employ of the nobility.
