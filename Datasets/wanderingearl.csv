The Thrill Of Traveling To Iraq,"*For the past 10 days, I’ve been backpacking through Iraqi Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in the north of Iraq. For five of those days I was joined by Anil Polat ofFoxNomad.com, a fellow adventurer and a most hilarious traveling companion. I have a lot to write about my time in Iraq and so much has happened that I find it quite difficult to actually organize my thoughts. So in the meantime, I’m just going to write whatever comes to mind, and I hope you’ll excuse me for the randomness that may result! At the end of the day, I can speak of human interactions, life lessons and that first-hand education that travel provides all I want, but I’ll be completely honest with you, there’s something else that excites me even more than any of these aspects of travel. Over the years, I’ve discovered that my happiness reaches its highest peaks...","December 9th, 2010",https://wanderingearl.com/the-thrill-of-traveling-to-iraq/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
I Bought A Zoo While Traveling In Mexico,"I don’t buy much while traveling. After all, I don’t have a house or an apartment to call my own and so, where would I put things if I bought them? I’m certainly not going to lug everything around with me everywhere I go and at the same time, I usually don’t see the point of buying something only to put it in storage. With that said, over the past 13 years, there have certainly been times when I simply couldn’t resist. I saw something and I wanted it and even though I knew that it was going to end up in thatone box I have in a closetat my mom’s place in the US, there was no stopping me. And that, my friends, is how I ended up buying azoowhile in Oaxaca, Mexico just a few days ago. Yup. I bought a zoo, sort of.

Should Travel Warnings Stop Us From Traveling?,"Right now I’m actually in the stages of deciding where my next adventure will take me, and as a result, it was only natural that I check the US Department of State’s Travel Warning website. This is generally how I begin any of my travel planning, not in order to learn which countries I should circumvent, but quite the opposite, to learn which regions I should consider visiting. A few months ago, I wrote a post about the growing misconception that Mexico is adangerous destinationthat should be avoided by travelers. So when I checked the Travel Warning website today, it came as no surprise to find Mexico listed right there after Mali and Mauritania as places to avoid, despite the fact that the closest I’ve come to any danger during my seven months of living down here was when I encountered this thing below while on the beach.

The International Towing and Recovery Museum. I Loved It.,"I saw the sign on the side of the highway as I rolled into the small city of Chattanooga. Two days later, I drove past the sign again. I saw it a third time when I tried to find a gas station the next day. And each time I saw the sign, I shook my head, admittedly, with some internal laughter at what I thought was a silly, silly idea for a museum. Today, I stand, or sit, here before you and with a straight face and a renewed appreciation for life’s surprises, I declare that I was wrong. What seemed like a museum worth ignoring proved to be a museum well worth visiting. Of none other do I speak than theInternational Towing and Recovery Museumin Chattanooga, Tennessee.

A Recap Of My Wander Across Mexico Tour,"Yesterday, my secondWandering Earl Tourcame to an end. And I must say, it was a strange feeling to say goodbye to another group of splendid people, people whom I was fortunate to get to know quite well over the past two weeks. I would absolutely love to continue traveling with everyone, to continue sharing experiences, to continue engaging in interesting conversations and to continue learning about each other and the places we visit. But of course, such a trip must finish eventually and after fifteen days of wandering across Mexico, from the beaches of the Caribbean coast all the way to the central state of Oaxaca, while stopping in a variety of destinations along the way, the time has come to part ways with this group of ten fellow travelers.

My Time in Delhi,"“Really?” That one word is the most typical response I hear whenever I explain to a fellow traveler that I enjoy spending time in Delhi, India. And usually, such travelers throw in an “I just don’t get it” or “I don’t see the appeal” or “Are you crazy?” as well, finding it extremely difficult to comprehend how I could possibly like this city of thirteen million people. I don’t know. I like Delhi. I’ve spent a great deal of time in this city over the years and it quickly became one of my favorite destinations in this country. This is a city where I can wander through the chaotic lanes and alleys shooting off ofChandni Chowk, the never-ending market area in the heart of Old Delhi.

Cambodia: Sitting In A Puddle On A Train,"“Hello,” the young man shyly whispered after tapping me on the shoulder several times. “Hello,” I replied somewhat groggily. “Thank you,” he then said before turning around and victoriously running back to his group of friends who showered him with endless high-fives and pats on the back. My morning nap had been interrupted but I couldn’t help but smile. I glanced around and sure enough, I was still surrounded by the same 150 Cambodians as when I had fallen asleep. We were all waiting for the same train, the only train of the day. And the train was late. Five hours late so far.

My Trip to Cuba: Day 1 (Walking 14km in Havana),"Less than five minutes after we walked onto the streets of Havana for the very first time, my friends and I were strolling along the sidewalk when a man clad in a bright yellow t-shirt, carrying two large canvas bags, called out to us. Before I knew it, I was helping this jolly fellow carry one of those heavy bags while engaging in some conversation with him. Suddenly, he stopped walking, we put the bags down and he pulled out a bottle of rum. He poured some into a plastic cup and handed it to me, and then he poured one for himself. We both said “Salud!”, he followed up with a “Bienvenidos a Cuba!” and we each threw back our shots. Then we simply shook hands, smiled and nodded to each other and went our own ways.

"A Chinese Bar, Shisha & Sexy, Sexy In Iraq","Upon arrival in the southern Kurdistan city of Sulamainiyah,Aniland I instantly found ourselves giddy with joy upon discovering two Chinese restaurants in the vicinity of our hotel. After all, up until that point, the only food we’d eaten were chicken and falafel sandwiches, not because of an abnormal love for such food, but because that was all we could find in other parts of the region. So as soon as evening approached and our hunger grew, we eagerly wandered over to the larger of the two Chinese restaurants we’d seen and prepared ourselves for a much needed feast of yummy Asian cuisine. Of course, had we taken a few minutes to properly think this plan through, we might have paused before deciding to enter this second floor restaurant.

Is Traveling To North Korea Ethical?,"Before I decided to travel to North Korea, I had a good, long think about whether or not such a trip was right for me. And of course, one of the main debates I had with myself involved the ethical issues associated with visiting a country that is run by one of the most repressive regimes in the world. There are many angles to view this ethical debate but in general, those who are against traveling to North Korea make the following arguments: I can certainly understand all of those points and I can also understand why some people would never visit North Korea based on the above. But, despite those arguments, I obviously decided that visiting this country was worth it in the end, at least for me.

From bed and breakfasts to cabin lodges and treehouses, these accommodation options have long been popular across the continent and are now growing even more rapidly compared to traditional hotels. Staying at these accommodations will not only often save you some money but they will offer unique experiences that can make for a more unforgettable travel experience.

This is a feeling I often deal with, one that results from walking along a thin line between trying to avoid living a life full of regrets and trying to gain as intense an education as I can from my travels.

Given the nature of my nomadic lifestyle, I’ve been forced to ask for such favors quite often, especially during my yearly trips home to the USA.

It’s a Struggle to Take a Good Travel Photo,"Oh, the torture. The writing, the emails, the tweeting…that stuff is all good. The real challenge, the real thorn with this blogging stuff, comes from the photos. Taking a perfect travel photo to post online – on Facebook, the blog or Instagram – is just plain difficult. And to do it over and over and over again? It’s madness I tell you. The pressure is immense and getting that perfect shot, especially when we want to be in the photo ourselves, takes extreme effort, and usually some pain. Sweat and tears are all a part of it. I wish it were as easy as just facing the camera and snapping away, but it’s not. In fact, always wondering if I’ll get that desperately needed winner of a travel photo has ruined many a days, it’s led to many sleepless nights and has cost me hundreds of dollars in therapy sessions....","July 26th, 2016",https://wanderingearl.com/how-to-take-the-perfect-travel-photo/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
The Best Beaches to Visit in Barbados,"As one of the most beautiful islands in the Caribbean, Barbados is home to stunning beaches that offer an array of numerous experiences amongst its soft sands and crystal-clear waters.

With over 80 beaches to explore, you might need help deciding which to visit. So, here are some of the best beaches to visit in Barbados. Carlisle Bay is a large bay close toBridgetown, Barbados’ capital city. Being near the capital makes it one of the island’s most popular beaches. On the southern end of the bay, you’ll find Brownes Beach, a quiet and serene area best suited for those looking to relax away from the crowd.

Choosing the Perfect European Spring Getaway,"One of the primary considerations when planning a spring getaway is the weather. While Europe experiences a generally mild climate during this season, there can be significant variations from city to city. For those seeking warmth and sunshine, Southern European destinations like Barcelona, Rome, and Athens are excellent choices. With temperatures ranging from the mid-60s to low 70s Fahrenheit (around 18-24°C), these cities offer ideal conditions for exploring outdoor attractions and soaking up the sun. On the other hand, if you prefer cooler temperatures and blossoming landscapes, consider Northern European cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Edinburgh. While the weather may still be brisk, the vibrant spring blooms and fewer crowds make these destinations a delight to explore. Spring in Europe is synonymous with festivals and cultural celebrations, making it an exciting time to visit. From colorful flower parades to traditional folk festivals, there’s no shortage of events to choose...","April 9th, 2024",https://wanderingearl.com/choosing-the-perfect-european-spring-getaway/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
My Favorite Travel Destinations In Eastern Europe,"Two nights ago, my fourthWandering Earl Tourofficially came to an end. Our group of ten mighty fine individuals wined (drank beer actually) and dined for the last time together after having traveled around Romania and Moldova for the past two weeks. And while I genuinely hope that everyone on the tour enjoyed their experience in this part of the world, I don’t hesitate for a second to state that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience myself. In fact, these last two weeks helped me reconfirm a couple of things. First, I absolutely love running these Wandering Earl Tours. Never did I imagine I would ever work on a project like this but now, I literally can’t wait for every single tour to begin. Second, I absolutely love Romania and Moldova and all of Eastern Europe in general.

My ‘Travel Date’ With A Guy Named Kaji,"Anyone who has spent even a short amount of time traveling would certainly be familiar with the ‘travel date’. This is when we actively seek out another traveler to spend time with despite knowing that we will end up having the exact same conversation, one that revolves around a very typical set of questions, that we’ve had thousands of times before. However, it is important to point out that there are some key differences between the ‘travel date’ and normal dating. First, instead of love, travelers are often just looking for someone to hang out with for the day. Second, instead of having the luxury of sifting through thousands and thousands of online profiles hoping to find a good match, we travelers must use a different method to find our companions. We must sit in the hostel lounge, pretending to read a book, as we scan the room out of...","March 25th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/my-travel-date-with-a-guy-named-kaji/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Please Don’t Be Afraid To Travel On Your Own,"You want to travel. You make a vague plan. Maybe you’ll fly to Thailand or maybe to Mexico, but either way, you’re leaving in six months time. You start saving money, you start doing research every single night and your level of excitement grows with each passing hour. Of course, as this will be your first ‘real’ travel experience, you’re a bit afraid to travel on your own and naturally prefer to travel with other people. So you start asking your friends to join you on your epic adventure. As you show them photos you found online of white sand beaches on a Thai island and of the Mayan ruins of Chichen-Itza, you are more than confident that you will have a travel partner or two in no time at all.

Here are three books, two of which are written by fellow bloggers, that I’ve read in the past month or so.

After bouncing around Kenya and Tanzania for a while, it was time to take it easy and catch up on work, and Zanzibar seemed like a logical, and nearby, option. All we hoped for was a relatively quiet beach in a tropical setting, close to a local village, and where accommodation wasn’t too expensive. And it didn’t take long to find our ideal setup. For two whole nights at least. The place we chose to stay at is thePromised Land Lodge, located on the very southern tip of Zanzibar.

But at the same time, I understand that saying “I work online” doesn’t really give others much insight into how I actually earn my money and consequently, how I fund my travels these days. The question that a lot of people want to know is: “What does ‘working online’ really mean?” First, let me give you a quick background about how I got started.

Eight days later, I was right back in front of that very same airport once again, and I could still barely chat with those around me. This time, however, it was because I simply didn’t want my Galapagos trip to end. What happened in between is quite a tale. It’s a tale of expectations being far exceeded.

How to Plan for Expat Life Around the World,"If you want to live the expat life, with dreams of living affordably and comfortably in a foreign land that offers an enticing set of benefits, it’s possible. It’s not always straightforward and simple, but it’s possible. While it would be wonderful if we could just show up in a new country, find a place to live and get settled into a new life, unfortunately, that’s not how it works. You can do that for a limited period of time (usually up to 3 months) in many places but beyond that timeframe, the process gets trickier. This is why it’s vital to not just plan ahead, but to really dedicate significant time to figuring out how to achieve your expat goal before you buy a plane ticket or start looking for apartments.

Why Live at Home When You Can Live in…Mexico,"This afternoon I interfered with nature by rescuing a centipede from a violent gang of tiny ants that were pecking away at its head. I then relocated my hundred-legged friend to a different part of my balcony where it was able to wander around freely. So proud was I with my act of heroism that I crossed my arms and leaned back against a plastic deck chair, staring out towards the ocean, envisioning an endless stream of future rescues. I then accidentally tipped the chair a bit and the puddle of water on the seat fell to the floor and drowned the centipede I had saved. So it goes.

These are questions that I wrestled with often during the first few years of my travels, but eventually, my experiences around the world helped me to reach an actual conclusion, a conclusion that I’ve stuck with for the past several years now. And I still believe it to be the right decision for me. So, how do I deal with human rights and travel? Will I visit countries that fit the above descriptions? Yes, yes I will.

The only thing missing sometimes is the road itself. An overly squeaky, yet oddly enjoyable, Hindi pop song blared from the crackly speakers as the decrepit bus chugged along through India’s remote Spiti Valley. The wooden-planked floor rattled constantly, adding a unique beat to the tune along with the hypnotic vibrations of the many broken window frames. The bouncing up and down of the passengers, in response to the cracks, potholes and rocks on this semi-paved ‘highway’, resembled a choreographed piece of modern dance. The bus was full, every bench holding up to four colorfully dressed locals crammed together. The bags of rice, sacks of vegetables, and bulky boxes of unknown goods packed into the aisles acted as seats for more than a dozen others.

And this is when such observations as “Your clothes are clean. Your hair isn’t a mess. You’re clean shaven. You don’t stink.” are mentioned.

2016: A Most Fascinating and Unexpected Journey,"The year 2016 really was a fascinating and unexpected journey for me. It was an extremely happy journey, to say the least. Okay, maybe I had a similarly brilliant year when I was 9 (after all, that’s when Krissy accepted the bracelet I gave her in the elementary school playground) but my memory is somewhat foggy at this point to know for sure. As far as my adult life goes though, let’s say after age 18, last year was extraordinary. Now I could tell you that the happiness that persisted throughout most of 2016 stemmed from my travels. After all, it was certainly a year to remember as destinations such as India, Brunei, Philippines, Taiwan, Mexico, Lithuania, Romania, Cuba, Nepal,Maldives, Oman, Jordan and Israel filled my itinerary. It was one intriguing land after another. But, alas, my happiness was actually not from the travel.

My Visit To The Breakaway Territory Of Transnistria,"You may or may not have heard of the country of Moldova. It’s a tiny country, only 34,000 square kilometers and with only three and a half million inhabitants, located in Eastern Europe, to the northeast of Romania. But, that’s not the question right now. The question is – have you heard ofTransnistria? Transnistria is a Moldovan breakaway territory, located between Ukraine and the Dniester River in eastern Moldova, a territory that declared itself an independent state back in 1990, and has basically continued to operate as such despite not being recognized by any other country. The territory of Transnistria has it’s own President, it’s own Parliament and even it’s own currency, Transnistrian rubles. It has its own flag, it’s own license plates and all visitors to the region must pass through a heavily secured border, complete with an immigration and customs inspection.

"Life is Good in Sayulita, Mexico","For anyone who didn’t know, I spent the month of July traveling through Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico. It was another excellent adventure and I’ll get around to writing more about it as soon as I have a chance.But at the moment, I’m living in paradise! I’m in the small village ofSayulita, right on the west coast of Mexico, in the state of Nayarit. I’ve been here for 10 days so far and I have no intention of leaving any time soon. Here’s why… 1.The town is small (about 1500 residents) and super-friendly, making it a great place to improve my Spanish. 2.The atmosphere is about as laid-back as it gets and I never have to wear shoes or a shirt. 3.The beaches are perfect – long, beautiful stretches of sand set under a backdrop of jungle and palm trees. 4.It’s cheap – the monthly rent for my modern...","September 3rd, 2009",https://wanderingearl.com/life-is-good-in-sayulita-mexico/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
The Mass Games in Pyongyang – Impressive & Frightening,"On the second night of the trip, our group had the opportunity to witness the Mass Games in Pyongyang, North Korea. In fact, when I had signed up for the trip to North Korea, one of the main reasons I chose these particular dates and this particular itinerary was because it did indeed include this experience. The Mass Games is a synchronized spectacle of gymnastics, acrobatics, dance, drama, music and special effects that has been held every year since 2002 in North Korea, between the months of August and October, as part of the annual Arirang Festival. It involves over 100,000 participants (yes, 100,000!), some as young as five or six years old, who practice for months leading up to the event. The performance lasts for 90 minutes and takes place inside of the May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, which is the only stadium where the Mass Games are held...","August 22nd, 2013",https://wanderingearl.com/watching-the-mass-games-in-pyongyang/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

For 3 nights and 4 days we were in ‘the zone’. It was eye-opening, educational and very raw, all in one. We stayed in an old Soviet hotel in Chernobyl city, the only working town in the exclusion zone and home to several thousand people, almost all of whom work in some power plant / disaster related job. The rest of the population in town run the shop, two hotels, restaurant and other small businesses that support the workers.

Why I Always Trust My Traveler Instinct,"During the three days I spent in Istanbul earlier this month, something didn’t feel right. Sure, I followed the general routine that I usually follow, and have enjoyed greatly, during my earlier travels to this city. I booked a private room at the friendlyCheers Hostel, I returned to my favorite eateries scattered around the back streets and lanes of a variety of neighborhoods, I smoked shisha at my favorite nargile cafe located in a beautiful 300-year old ex-school-turned-market situated behind a small cemetery, and I spent time each day admiring some of my favorite sights. But on this occasion, as I did all of the above, I didn’t feel as comfortable as I have felt on those previous twelve or so visits.

Just like home owners who don’t want their property broken into, the above tactics of travelers are the equivalent of those “Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted” and “Private Property, Keep Away” signs.

While I’ve traveled throughPakistan and Afghanistanpost-9/11, ventured to the front line of the battle for Kashmir, roamed the bombed out neighborhoods ofBeirut, the killing fields of Cambodia and areas of Central America that have seen much fighting over the years, I’ve never actually lived through war.

And after a lengthy pause, I replied by saying that while I certainly do intend to visit all 193+ countries at some point during the span of my life, I’m obviously not too dedicated to this goal. Clearly, if visiting every country in the world was a top priority of mine, I would be traveling around to places such as Namibia or Latvia right now, places I’ve yet to visit, instead of finding myself back in Thailand for the ninth time since I began traveling in 1999.

I waited in line at immigration for a few minutes, handed over my passport and about 45 seconds later I was done. No questions were asked, they took a quick photo of me and then they stamped my passport. The next step was a security check (yes, even when arriving) – the standard conveyor belt x-ray for your bags that you find at every airport. This only took a few minutes and then we went to collect our luggage from the luggage carousel, which also didn’t take long at all. From here, we walked through the customs inspection in about five seconds and ended up in the Arrivals Hall right after.

The Biggest Traveling Tool Of 2010,"That’s right. I’m the tool.

At first, it sounds like quite the compliment and believe you me, I quickly offered my sincerest thanks to this friend for her kind words. But as soon as my friend dropped her head into her hands in what appeared to be a moment of disbelief, or perhaps disgust, I realized that something was wrong.

Why You Should Consider a Vacation to Jamaica,"It’s not a surprise that I often think back to my recent trip to Jamaica.

I had been to Jamaica many times when I worked on board cruise ships as a Tour Manager, way back in the early 2000s. But this time was different. Instead of visiting for a mere few hours at a time, on this occasion, it was a full 10 days on the island.

I Just Had The Crappiest Visit To The Taj Mahal,"The journey from Rishikesh to the world famous city of Agra (home of the Taj Mahal) was quite lengthy, taking us almost twelve hours to complete.

How To Deal With The Culture Shock Of Big Cities,"Arriving in a new country, especially if it’s your first time traveling, is almost guaranteed to be an intimidating experiencing.

But it’s another thing to suddenly find yourself in the midst of a chaotic, intense and shockingly overwhelming city only minutes after your flight arrives. No wonder so many travelers are not particularly fond of the world’s largest metropolises!

How Much Money Do You Need To Start A Life Of Travel?,"A desire to explore the world is hard to ignore, and for many travelers, as soon as that desire became too strong to be ignored, they simply packed up their backpack or suitcase and took off into the unknown.

The fact is, you’ll barely make it across your home town if you don’t have at least a few dollars, pounds, euros or yen in your bank account. So, once again, the question is: Is it $4000, $10,000, $35,000, $100,000?

So when I popped out from behind the curtain, the last thing I expected to run into was a line of ten teenage girls walking through the building on a school field trip. Trying to act as casually as possible, I just smiled and nodded as they filed past. I had no other choice as they were blocking my path to where Jaroslav was waving for me to join him. But as soon as the girls were out of the room, I bolted over to cubicle #5. Then, following Jaroslav’s instructions,...","February 17th, 2010",https://wanderingearl.com/slovakia-mud-salt-and-nudity-at-the-piestany-spa/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

Is it Really Possible to ‘Live Life to the Fullest’?,"We were eating soup at a local restaurant in Bucharest when my new friend seated opposite me, upon learning that I had been traveling and living overseas since I was 22 years old, stated with great excitement, “So that means you’ve spent your entire adult life traveling!” After a short pause, I quietly responded, “I guess it does.” I had actually never thought about that fact before and as I sat there repeating it over and over again in my mind – “I’ve spent my entire adult life traveling” – I surprisingly started to feel a slight sense of sadness as opposed to the joy one might have expected.

I Went To South Africa & Adopted A Penguin,"It is only natural to expect some sort of animal encounter when one visits the vast continent that is Africa. And even though I prefer to travel without too many expectations these days, I would be telling a fib if I were to claim that I was not at all excited about seeing the animals that inhabit this region. Images of cheetahs, elephants and giraffes, of lions and antelopes and zebras, of leopards and hippopotamuses, flashed before me during the 15 hour flight from New York City to Johannesburg a few days ago. And of course, I also thought of…penguins. Penguins? Maybe I am telling a slight fib after all. The idea of observing some African penguins was admittedly not an idea that I spent much time dwelling on before the trip.

Are You A Messy Traveler Too?,"Whenever I am living in one place for a good amount of time, let’s say a few weeks or more, I tend to be quite a clean and orderly individual. I always make my bed each morning, I keep my clothes in a closet or in drawers and I make sure that everything is in place before I head outside. If I cook some food, I always clean the kitchen soon after (sometimes even before eating) and after taking a shower, I make sure the bathroom floor is dry and spotless. I enjoy a clean room or apartment. It makes me feel good, especially when, at night, I climb into my bed after another long day out and about.

Why would I be sitting at a table for so long, with my laptop open and turned on, with my hands on the keyboard in typing position but, without my fingers moving at all. In all honesty, up until a moment ago, I was as equally confused as they have been. The problem is that it’s been a struggle for me to write as of late.

However, our destination was not Chichen-Itza. We were interested in two lesser known locations instead, the small historic city ofValladolidand the cenote ofSamula.

Setting Up Your eSIM: A Beginner’s Guide,"Traveling today is more connected than ever, thanks to the technology in our pockets.

After the speed bump, drivers should keep on driving unless one of the heavily armed police officers tells you to stop.

An Afternoon Meeting With A Queen,"Walking down George Street towards Sydney’s Circular Quay, I stopped dead in my tracks the moment my eyes unexpectedly fell upon her. And before I was able to continue moving in her direction, I needed several deep breaths and a nod of reassurance from myself that I could handle being any closer. Only somewhat convinced that I would not break down in tears or begin begging for her to take me back, I approached cautiously, with the hair on my arms standing on end, my heart pounding uncontrollably and with the undeniable magnetism of this seductive Queen slowly engulfing me. I wanted to turn around and run, but my feet refused to do so. And before long, I had no choice but to admit what was happening. Exactly as I had feared, as I stood there, right next to the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship docked in Circular Quay, I was...","February 25th, 2011",https://wanderingearl.com/an-afternoon-meeting-with-a-queen/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Travel Light & Leave The Extra Socks Behind,"Knowing that I’d be spending a decent amount of time in Romania, I loaded up my backpack with more clothes than usual when I recently paid a visit to my family back in the US. Normally, the weight of my backpack remains a relatively constant 8 or 9 kilograms (18 – 20 lbs) but as I crossed the Atlantic Ocean this time, I was carrying 15 kilograms (33 lbs), a weight that I can’t remember carrying around in a long time. Why all the extra clothes? I simply figured that being based in Romania, and taking short side trips to various countries around Eastern Europe, would require me to have a completely different wardrobe than usual, one that was more flexible and more suitable for spending a longer period of time in one location. Maybe I would have to dress up for some occasion or just want to wear a...","June 4th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/travel-light-leave-the-extra-socks-behind/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
My 7 Links: Posts You Might Have Missed,"Last week I received an email from that sociable Canadian couple known as theTraveling Canucksinforming me that they had nominated me to participate in the “My 7 Links” project. This project, started by Katie over atTripbase, offers a way for travel bloggers to share some of their content that might have otherwise become lost in the archives over time while also helping spread the word about other travel bloggers they follow. Below, you’ll find seven ‘questions’ and seven blog posts that answer those questions, and at the end, I’ll nominate five other travel bloggers to do the same on their own websites. This post highlights a 78-year old man I met last year who had dedicated the later stage of his life to serving one particular street food item in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.

How Do I Survive? (and how you can survive too…),"Ever since I resigned about a year ago from my job as a Tour Manager on board cruise ships, two of the most common questions I am asked are: What do you do now? How are you able to travel so much? When faced with these questions, I have so far relied on rather vague and somewhat silly responses such as “I’m a freelancer” or “I do internet stuff”. It’s not that I have anything to hide, I just find it difficult to explain the actual truth. But if I’m going to do this website properly, I guess I have to put a little more effort into my answers. So here’s my best attempt to explain how I am able to live my unconventional life of constant world travel.

Do Long-Term Travelers Prepare For Retirement?,"There seems to be a general belief that anyone who decides to travel extensively or to give up the traditional 9-5 lifestyle in favor of a life that focuses on the achievement of one’s goals, is at least in some small way acting in an irresponsible manner. After all, such a person is trading the stability and safety of a normal routine in order to head off into the wild unknown where others believe they won’t have access to health insurance, they won’t be able to start a family and they certainly won’t be saving money for their future. I hear about this last one all the time. In fact, here’s a common question that I am asked: “Isn’t it irresponsible of you to just travel around without saving up for retirement?” And my answer is simple. “Yes, such a thing is very, very irresponsible.

We spent most of that day walking around town before eating a late lunch. We did happen to finish off that lunch with several rounds of vodka and we also happened to continue drinking vodka back at our hotel later that evening, however, the vodka had nothing to do with any celebration for being on the road for 5000 days.

And I’m fully confident that when I return to Bucharest next week, that inspiration will only increase even more. I’ve realized that over the past month and a half, instead of just thinking about what I want to accomplish, and then procrastinating forever, I’ve been taking concrete steps and working hard to achieve the goals I’ve set for myself these days.

Okay, I honestly don’t like PayPal much at all. It’s a pain. Every transaction I make seems to be a hassle, the fees are quite high and I’ve found their Customer Service to be mediocre at best.

Spending Some Time in a Place Called Old Lyme,"I will admit that I had never heard of the idyllic shore front hamlet of Old Lyme, Connecticut before my grandmother and her husband Leo began spending time up here at Leo’s summer cottage. And although the majority of you most likely have not heard of Old Lyme either, let me assure you that it is by no means a ‘nothing town.’ To begin with, it is this very community that the deadly, tick-borne Lyme disease is named after. I know, impressive indeed. Actually, that’s all I can think of at this time, but a lack of specific distinctions has certainly not stopped me from enjoying my yearly visits here. And Old Lyme is where I am right now.

Barcelona: 5 Cultural Sites to Visit,"The Catalonian capital, Barcelona, is a city with a broad and rich cultural landscape. One of the best things about visiting such a historical city is that its history is prevalent on the surface – the architecture, the colors and the landmarks. From Gaudí to Picasso, the city has been touched by many geniuses. Luckily, it’s very easy to soak in the work of these geniuses upon a weekend or short visit, which is why we have put together a piece on 5 worthwhile sites to add to your itinerary. Among the city’s many gems,Casa Batllóstands out as an iconic masterpiece. Designed by Antoni Gaudí, the legendary Catalonian architect, the building is a testament to the richness of Modernist architectural details. Characterized by its vibrant ceramic tiles, organic forms and intricate carvings, it goes beyond being just a building… it’s a sculpture that you can walk through.

Stuck In A Room Full Of Lace Panties Looking For Sexy Boots,"It’s not often that I find myself standing in the middle of a room full of women’s lingerie, so when I wandered into a Victoria’s Secret store during my quick stay in New York City last week, I wasn’t at my most comfortable. I tried my best to walk around as if I knew what I was doing, as if I’d been inside that store dozens of times before, but I think my inexperience instantly became obvious the moment I bumped right into a scantily-clad mannequin and accidentally knocked off the Christmas hat that ‘she’ was wearing on her head. The issue was that, ordinarily, a visit to a women’s undergarment shop, let alone one that offers such an impressively large variety of racy items, is not a part of my normal routine whenever I am back in the US.

A few moments later, I turned back towards the pyramids, ready for this Ancient Wonder of the World to shower me with all of its mesmerizing power. I waited and waited and waited some more.

During that weekend, a friend and I visited a section of the Carpathian Mountains located between the Romanian towns of Buzau and Brasov. We arrived by car and early Saturday morning we took off into the countryside, quickly finding ourselves having to navigate an endless collection of dirt roads, few of which existed on any map.

He apologized several times as he explained that due to the Eid al-Adha holiday, the city was overflowing with travelers and as a result, he was forced to turn all of his hotel rooms into dorm rooms in order to accommodate as many people as possible. My options were to stay in a dorm room with three other people or to sleep on a thin mattress on the roof of the building, where twenty other travelers had already set up their ‘beds’.

When Obama’s speech reached its end, I started to wonder what the eventual outcome would be of this undeniably historic day, hoping that somehow the announcement I just heard would lead to a more unified and peaceful planet.

How Much Would You Pay This Rickshaw Driver In India?,"It’s not a quiz. It’s not a contest. I’m genuinely interested in learning how you would handle the following situation. Three days ago, I spent two hours in theheart of Old Delhiwith a friend of mine who happened to be in the city as well. We wandered through the lanes of Chandni Chowk market, listened to the music inside of a Sikh temple and ate lunch at my favorite parantha-wallah. It was my typical routine.

Traveling With Technology & How I Keep It All Safe,"Most travelers carry some technology, some combination of gadgets, with them these days as they bounce around the world. Yet some travelers actually don’t carry any technology with them at all. It all depends on one’s needs. For me, in order to get my blogging/online work done, ensure I read often and keep me as connected to friends and family around the world as I can, I always travel with the following: Macbook Pro 13.3” RetinaPanasonic Lumix ZS20 CameraSamsung Google Nexus S smartphoneKindle eReader (You can read more about the items I travel with on my “Travel Gear” page.)

The Benefits of TSA Pre✓®,"When I traveled to Las Vegas ten days ago, I forgot to do one important thing when I booked my flight. And the result of this momentarily lapse was a long, forty minute wait to pass through security at Orlando International Airport. Normally, when I’m at a US airport I pass through the TSA Pre✓® lane – the speedy security lane for pre-screened passengers. But this time, I could only watch the speedy lane from the chaos of seven long regular security lanes merging into one, creeping slowly along as the frustration of those around me grew with each minute. Why was I in the regular security lane this time around? When booking my flight, I had forgotten to enter myKnown Traveler Numberinto the reservation. Simple as that. And with myKnown Traveler Number, the words “TSA Pre✓®” are printed across my boarding passes, allowing me to zip through the dedicated...","December 29th, 2015",https://wanderingearl.com/the-benefits-of-tsa-precheck/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Why I Took A Short Break From Everything,"It’s me, Earl. Back again. As you might have noticed, I took a short break from the blog. It started when I led my latest India tour back in February and continued as I took a ‘vacation’ once that tour came to an end. It wasn’t a planned break. I would sit down and try to write in the beginning but it just wasn’t happening. Then one day in the middle of March, while on Siquijor Island in the Philippines, I made the decision to stop trying until I felt ready to write. This morning I woke up and decided I was ready.

And from that single mention of the idea on the blog a month ago, I ended up with over twenty people on the ‘early list’. The ‘early list’ is what I use to gather the names of those who are interested in the tours I am planning before I have finalized all of the details.

The Day US Customs Found A Bullet In My Pocket,"On the flight from Delhi to Washington D.C., I spent a good two hours staring at the customs form that I was required to fill out. I had completed every section of the form, except for one. I just wasn’t quite sure if mentioning Pakistan and Afghanistan in the box that asked me to list the countries I had visited was such a good idea. As I wrote down the other countries I’d been to on this trip – Australia, Singapore, Thailand and India – I seriously wondered if I could get away with not listing the other two. (Of course, I wasn’t about to risk it and so I wrote them all down in the end.) Several hours later, on the ground in Washington D.C., I approached the Immigration Counter and handed over my form.

Every day was rewarding and we didn’t regret spending two weeks in this city at all. It’s calm, picturesque, friendly and full of activities and places to visit. The food is ever so tasty, it’s easy to get around and it’s also very affordable. It really was the ideal base. We also were there during autumn and it was gorgeous as a result.

Air-Conditioner Repair… Mexico Style,"Rarely do I use the air-conditioner in my apartment here in Mexico. As long as I open up all the windows, turn on the two main fans in the living room and open the balcony door, the temperature inside is usually bearable, even when the temperature outside reaches 100 degrees (35 C). Usually. Last Monday, this was not the case as my lungs and nostrils seemed to catch fire with every breath I inhaled and walking from the bedroom to the kitchen felt like I was swimming through a hot tub filled with molten lava. Okay, it wasn’t that bad but I was sweating heavily despite sitting directly under the fan. And so, on this occasion, I decided to turn on the air-conditioning unit for the first time.

Is Mexico Safe To Visit?,"“Is Mexico safe to visit?” is a question that not only am I asked quite often but a question that I see popping up all across the internet as well. And due to the fact that, just about ten days ago, I finished leading my two-week Wander Across Mexico tour, a tour that involved me taking a group of ten fellow travelers around this very country, I figured this would be a good time to bring the topic up on my blog. During those two weeks that we were in Mexico, our group visited approximately ten different destinations located in four different states. We slept in six different towns and cities and we covered a distance of around 2000 kilometers (1200 miles) from the starting point,Playa del Carmen, to the ending point, Oaxaca.

And as I stood on the side of the road, my heart began to beat a little faster as the truck shifted into reverse and backed up at a frighteningly fast speed. Again, the tires screeched,this time as the truck stopped right in front of me. The driver, a large man with a torn and dirtied t-shirt, and a serious, angry-looking face, remained in his seat while the passenger, an even larger man with a ripped t-shirt and lack of any expression resembling a smile, jumped out of the truck and approached me.

The Strange Habits Of A Traveler,"Why is it that whenever I return to the US I instantly stop feeling like a traveler? While my traveler’s mindset certainly does help me view these familiar surroundings in a new light, just as Tom pointed out in thecommentsof my last post, in the end, something just feels different. However, this morning, while putting on my shoes moments before stepping outside, I think I finally discovered the root of the issue. And it all has to do with juggling socks. For some bizarre reason, and I do this religiously while traveling, within minutes of waking up each morning, I pull out three, balled-up pairs of socks from my backpack (if a pair is dirty I’ll use a ball of tissue in its place) and start juggling.

I received my entry stamp, picked up my backpack (which for the first time in all my travels was one of the first few pieces of luggage to come out onto the luggage carousel) and proceeded through the customs inspection.

Thank You to the Militant Who Stole My Car!,"Truth be told, we human beings often don’t understand the true value of a particular moment in our lives until well after that moment has passed. Yet we often forget this undeniable fact in our quest to immediately categorize every interaction and event that occurs, so that we may quickly embrace the positive and discard the negative. Lately, I’ve reached the conclusion that every single goal I’ve achieved, hurdle I’ve overcome, step of progress I’ve made and lesson I’ve learned, would not have been possible without the mishaps, pain, disappointments, struggles and ‘mistakes’ I’ve dealt with along the way.

How A Clock Tower In Albania Changed My Life,"While my last post was all about the people you meet while traveling, I also want to make it clear that I do enjoy visiting the sights of a particular destination as well. Popular attractions are popular for a reason and so I often do try to seek them out in the hopes of discovering something interesting, educational or just plain fun. Such sights naturally include museums, castles, waterfalls, historical buildings, mountains offering panoramic views, religious sites, parks, monuments or any number of endless possibilities. And just like any tourist, I wander around, I take my photos, I say to myself ‘this is nice’ and then I move on to the next place. My theory is that even though spending time visiting such mainstream attractions may not sound appealing at first, doing so can sometimes lead to the most unexpected of rewards.

A Toast to My Kelty Redwing 2900 Backpack,"Back in late November of 1999 I purchased a backpack without giving it much thought. I was about to leave for Southeast Asia and I needed a backpack. I walked into an REI store in Boston, wandered up to the grand wall of backpacks, unhooked the first one that caught my attention and tried it on. Moments later I walked out of the store carrying my new friend, a Kelty Redwing 2900. At the time, my only hope was that the backpack would survive a few months of traveling around Asia. I expected nothing more than that. Grayish in color with a bold black trim, my Kelty Redwing 2900 has more than proven itself over the years.

My daily routine since arriving in this paradise has been quite simple and it has barely changed at all during my stay. I generally wake up at around 9:00am, I head to the beach for a couple of hours for some sun and a swim, eat a late breakfast/early lunch consisting of muesli and fruit or an omelet, spend a few hours working on my laptop in order to avoid being out in the midday heat, head back to the beach around 3:30pm for some more sun and swimming, where I stay until just before sunset, which I watch from my beach hut at around 6:00pm.

Enchanting City of Shanghai: Journey Through Modern China,"Shanghai, a metropolis that has been synonymous with rapid development and modernity, is a city that embodies the new face of China. With a rich history dating back centuries, it’s a city that marries the old with the new, creating a dynamic, thriving atmosphere that’s unlike any other place on Earth. If you’re considering a visit to this bustling hub of innovation, commerce, and culture, you’ll need to secure a China travel visa, but rest assured, the experience is well worth it. Before we delve into the exciting facets of modern Shanghai, let’s take a step back in time to appreciate the city’s history.

Maybe it was a heart-stopping view from a mountain peak, the unexpected kindness of a stranger in a bustling market or the taste of a dish unlike anything you’d ever experienced before? Travel forces us to go outside our usual boundaries. Those who venture to other countries experience the vast tapestry of cultures and landscapes that exist in our world. As a result, our minds expand, our understanding of how lives intertwine grows and we gain the knowledge that human beings are all connected.

The Currency of Pad Thai,"I just can’t stop thinking about pad thai.

It is hands-down the most splendid dish on the planet. However, even though I love to eat these noodles as often as possible, the reason why thoughts of pad thai so constantly occupy my mind actually has much less to do with its ingredients than it does with…shopping.

How Much It Costs To Travel In Lebanon,"In comparison to neighboring Syria, Lebanon is an expensive country to travel around.

And that’s not to mention the French bakeries serving delicious cakes! You can basically find anything you want in Beirut and as a result, travelers tend to spend a bit more. The ultra-budget travelers among us could possibly survive in Lebanon for about $25 USD per day, but this would require you to once again sleep on rooftops and eat little more than Middle Eastern sandwiches.

And that is exactly what you used to have to do if you wanted to convert your foreign driver license into a local one for a stay longer than 90 days in the Philippines. In response to quarantine restrictions and the temporary closure of some of its physical offices during this time, the Land Transportation Office of the Philippines introduced an online portal on May 18th. This will help to reduce their backlog and make the application process easier and smoother for both local and foreign drivers.

Travel Products & Websites Worth Checking Out,"The year that is 2015 has brought me into contact with what seems like a higher-than-normal number of travel products, travel-related websites and travel services that I never knew about before. From all sorts of travel communities to compact hammocks to online postcards to oddly-shaped travel pillows that actually seem to make sleeping on airplanes even more uncomfortable, new things are popping up in my inbox every day. If I were to remember them all, the list would be quite extensive. But just like I forgot to pack my suit pants last week while traveling to a family event on the other side of the country, by this point, I have forgotten many of the websites and apps and products that I’ve come across this year.

Travel Hacking 101: How to Earn Free Flights and Free Hotel Stays,"*This is a guest post from Matt Kepnes, the popular blogger and fellow traveler behind NomadicMatt.com I love budget travel. Finding deals, saving money, and heading out into the world with just a backpack is an amazing feeling. And with the advent of the sharing economy, budget airlines, and detailed travel blogs to help you plan better, travel has never been more accessible or affordable. But that doesn’t mean travel isalwaysaffordable. Plane tickets still cost hundreds of dollars (if not more). Hostel stays add up. Insurance, gear, and getting from city to city can eat into even the most frugal of budgets. Fortunately, there’s a way to cut costs drastically — without sacrificing comfort and without spending any extra money either. It’s called travel hacking.

Eurail Adventure: Brasov to Sighisoara,"From the small city of Brasov to the medieval town of Sighisoara, this leg of my train journey made the previous one fromBucharest to Brasovseem much less crowded than I had earlier described. In fact, that earlier trip now resembled a quiet day on a deserted island in comparison to the circus that was my trip to Sighisoara. However, I do believe that everyone loves a good circus and without a doubt, I certainly loved thisRomanian train ride, despite the crowds of people, with bodies overlapping and legs tangled together, that filled every inch of the train car I rode in. And not only was the overhead compartments so overstuffed with luggage, but it was practically impossible to walk down the aisle of the train due to all of the baggage that had to be piled up there as well.

A place that left you wide-eyed and in awe, practically skipping around and always with a smile on your face? Maybe it’s a location that seems very much like a fairy tale and without any effort at all, you feel as if you have been inserted straight into the magical story.

Travel Clothes Perfected With Aviator Jeans,"It’s not a secret. I’m just not a fan of ‘travel clothes’. After 19 years of traveling the world, I don’t understand the concept. Fast-drying clothes?That sounds good but I don’t need clothes that dry in 27 seconds. Regular drying time works for me. Convertible pants/shorts?Wonderful! However, I don’t think I’ve ever felt a need to switch between the two in the middle of a day, ever. Am I weird? Super special material?I get it. Different materials have different benefits. Sure, some materials keep you cooler, some keep you warmer. Some are known for their otherworldly softness or their ability to stay ‘clean’, or at least hide the smell. But good old regular cotton does the trick, too.

The Best Worst Museum in the World,"We pushed open a massive wooden door and found ourselves in a small, dark room. A middle-aged man was sound asleep in a plastic chair behind a dusty wooden desk. He woke up to the creak of the door as it closed and without hesitation grumpily blurted out, “Tickets here”. He told us that two tickets cost 16000 TSH ($8 USD), which seemed to be an arbitrary number. The tickets themselves had no price on them and there wasn’t any sign or price list, but I handed over the money anyway. After all, this was THEHouse of Wondersin Stone Town, Zanzibar. With tickets in hand, and armed with the basic knowledge that this was the ceremonial palace of the second Sultan of Zanzibar, built around 1883, we pushed through the second wooden door and straight into the heart of the museum, ready to educate ourselves even more.

Let me give you a little background… The Tsotzil Mayans live in their own autonomous region in the Mexican state of Chiapas, a region that Mexican police and military are not allowed to enter. These Mayans, in order to maintain their culture and traditions, have extremely strict rules and practices and when any member of the community rebels or doesn’t adhere to these cultural rules, they are expelled, simple as that.

Small Hotels in Prague – Hotel Anna (A Review),"Two weeks ago, we were in Prague for a 5 night stay. It’s a popular city of course, with that impressive Baroque architecture, imposing castles and Gothic churches and an Old Town that everyone in the world seems eager to explore these days. As a result, it should’ve been no surprise when we ran into some difficultly finding accommodation. I’ll admit, we started looking for a room a little late, about a month before our arrival, but we still didn’t expect such a lack of availability. Hotels and guesthouses were full, the handful of Airbnb places left were extremely expensive and hostels only had beds open in their dorm rooms.

Ordinarily, I am more than happy to participate in a leisurely kayak experience and never have I felt my life threatened in any way whatsoever while paddling around any body of water. But, when I found myself paddling a kayak around the St. Lucia Estuary in South Africa, that all changed, and it changed quite quickly.

My Favorite Ways to Save Money on Travel,"Over the past 22 years of nonstop travel, I’ve repeatedly claimed that such long-term travel does not have to cost a fortune. Sometimes, finding ways to save money on travel is as easy as taking free walking tours, staying in hostels,staying away from major tourist zonesand using local buses and trains to get around. But it’s not always that easy. Depending on our travel style, destinations, length of trips and need for more comfort, some of the above money-saving methods might not be reasonable. Luckily, life has taught me that there is always a way to save money. Always. And here are a handful of my favorite tricks, tips and ways to save money on travel that I’ve used during my own global adventures.

"My Travels to Dakhla, Western Sahara: Straight Into the Unknown","Imagine an eerily quiet town in North Africa, set at the edge of the Sahara Desert, right in the middle of an impossibly narrow peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean. Imagine a harsh and constant 40 kmh wind blowing into your face, with sand flying around, caught up in the gusts, and going straight into your eyes and mouth. Looking around, you find empty intersections and very few vehicles on the streets, and you quickly notice that there’s barely any people walking around either. When someone does glide by in the distance, in their traditional hooded robe or cloth covered face to protect themselves from the elements, you wonder where the other people could possibly be. Imagine a town with seemingly little connection to the outside world, as if it were located on an entirely different planet altogether. Welcome to Dakhla, Western Sahara.

A few birds flew overhead, one car drove by. It was almost noon but everything was eerily still on this second day of exploring Havana. So eerily still, until we turned onto famous Avenida 23. Within one block, it suddenly seemed as if we had been transported into a completely different city than what we hadwitnessed the day before. Here were restaurants, a couple of bars, a scattering of shops, a cinema, a small group of prostitutes, a huge art-deco hotel, food stalls, a market and hundreds of people moving around everywhere.

Ordinary People & Their Inspiring Travel Stories,"Ever since I arrived back in Bucharest some ten days ago, my level of motivation has been at an all-time high, so much so that even the gray communist-style apartment blocks scattered all over this city seem inspiring these days.

Lately, I have been meeting such inspirational people that I can barely sit still, leaving me with a constant need to brainstorm, to create, to work on new ideas. Everyone I’m coming across, whether in person or online, just seems to have such inspiring travel stories to share and it’s pumping me up as well.

Well, I went yesterday for the first time in about three years and I must say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The store was filled with an endless variety of very cool gadgets and travel accessories, all of which cause travelers, such as myself, to wander around wide-eyed while trying to fend off the temptation to put everything we see into our shopping basket. Luckily, however, I am now skilled in the art of restraint, so by the time I walked out of the store some 45 minutes after I had arrived, I had spent a total of $0 dollars.

My ‘Infantile’ Views on Gay Marriage,"Yesterday, I came across a blog post that discussed the debate over gay marriage. I read the post and wrote a quick comment about my general opinion on the matter. Later in the day, I checked the post again and found that another reader had responded to my comment by describing my logic as“infantile”. Here’s a quick summary, even though it really isn’t relevant to the overall point of this post. I’m all for gay marriage. I believe that everyone deserves equality and that since such a change wouldn’t negatively affect the lives of anyone else, people shouldn’t stand in the way of other people’s rights. I know, it’s simple and basic. Regardless, being labeled “infantile” definitely stung. For a second. In the end, I just laughed it off and refrained from replying any further.

Using an Orange eSIM While Traveling Around Europe,"Traveling across Europe comes with its challenges, and staying connected is often at the top of the list. With the advent of European eSIMs, the days of juggling physical travel SIM cards are over. An eSIM works just like a regular SIM card but eliminates the need to install a physical one on your phone. You can forget about swapping out physical SIM cards when traveling, which can be a hassle and may lead to losing or damaging them. Some eSIM are limited and only provide data. However, there are companies such as Orange that offer eSIM/SIM packages that include not just data, but it also enables receiving and making phone calls, as well as sending and receiving text messages. This way, you can stay fully connected during your trip. You can make calls, surf the internet, play, share, research, watch, translate, or find activities right away.

The Perfect Travel Guide That Doesn’t Exist,"Wouldn’t it be brilliant if there was one definitive, perfect travel guide full of specific instructions that, when followed step-by-step by anyone on the planet, magically guarantees that we will be out there traveling the world long-term in no time at all? Oh, it would, it really would. But, the reality is that no matter how much we want such a guide, it simply does not exist. When we first discover that travel might be significantly more accessible than we once thought, it is natural for us to suddenly crave some set of concrete instructions from others and a pamphlet full of clearly laid-out rules from those who have already achieved such a goal.

But apart from that, I was unfortunately quite busy with some website issues. It all began on my first full day here, when I sat down at an internet cafe in order to check my emails.

A few swims in the Caribbean Sea and a handful of abnormally long sleeps seemed to have been exactly what I needed. Even when I sit down to work I find that I’m more motivated and focused now that my body and mind have been allowed to relax a little.

It’s called volcano boarding and there is also only one place in the world where you can do it – Cerro Negro, an active volcano near the town of Leon, Nicaragua. This ‘sport’ involves hiking up to the top of a volcano, sitting on a tiny wooden board and then sliding down the steaming mountain to the bottom. Now, this isn’t your normal sledding experience. This isn’t the small hill behind the elementary school. There is no snow. Nor is there any dirt or sand for that matter.

And while I’m open to doing some crazy things, I’m not sure if ‘craziest of the craziest’ was a category I wanted to be a part of.

Would you maintain your sanity if you had to constantly face unexpected situations, surprises, plans that always changed for one reason or another? Could you handle a lack of routine and perhaps not knowing where you’ll be in a week or two from any given moment? Are you okay with sleeping in different beds all the time, some comfortable, others barely more than a thin piece of foam set upon a hard piece of wood? What if you had to eat different foods, some familiar, others quite different to anything you’ve ever eaten before…does that sound appealing? Would you welcome a situation where everyone around you thought differently than you do, had different beliefs and customs, practiced different traditions, thought and behaved in ways you’d never seen or even knew existed?

The Final Walk…Adios Mexico!,"This morning, and for the last time in the foreseeable future, I walked along the white sand beach in front of my apartment. And as I walked along that beach, I took unusually small footsteps, making sure that I would never forget how that cool coral sand felt on my bare feet. Every few minutes I would enter the warm water, just up to my knees, and just stand there glancing around in every direction. To my right was an endless stretch of one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen and to my left was an even longer stretch of the same. Behind me sat a massive plot of low, dry jungle and in front of me, the indescribable shades of blue that make the Caribbean Sea so alluring. The morning was clear, with not a cloud to be found.

I’m actually writing this post from my room at the Ajay Hotel, a room that offers a perfect view of the holy Ganges River from the window next to my bed. And every time I glance out that window I am overcome with a feeling of awe as everything below, from the dark river to those bathing in its water or praying along its banks, to the holy men meditating on the steps, to the simple wooden rowboats passing by, makes it seem as if life in this 3000 year old city has stood...","December 18th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/the-wonderfully-fascinating-city-of-varanasi/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

How to Travel to Germany on a Budget,"There’s no escaping the fact that everything is getting more expensive. With the increased cost of living, you may be looking for ways to reduce how much you spend on your upcoming trip to Germany.

Although this post is about visiting Germany on a budget, the tips can be applied to just about any popular travel destination. There are some costs you can’t avoid when traveling, like the price of a visa or travel authorization. The good news is that, if you’re from a visa-exempt country such as the US, you don’t need a visa to travel to Germany for up to 90 days. Thenew travel authorization for Germany, ETIAS, won’t be operational until 2023 so you don’t need to pay these fees either just yet.

"A Quick Travel Guide to Dakhla, Western Sahara","Western Sahara is a disputed region in North Africa and is not a recognized country. About 80% of the territory is controlled by Morocco and 20% makes up theSahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. There is a sand wall that separates the two regions. From what I’ve gathered, after the Spanish gave up control of this entire territory in 1975, Morocco and Mauritania shared control, with the native Sahrawi people lacking the power needed to take over their claimed homeland. Eventually, amidst fighting, Mauritania moved out of the region and Morocco reinforced its presence. Western Sahara has been a disputed territory ever since, with most of the Sahrawi people living in and operating from refugee camps in Western Algeria. Dakhla is under Moroccan control, with Moroccan military checkpoints throughout the area and Moroccan government buildings and flags clearly displaying their presence.

You get to drive around and look at rusty old cars and buildings that have been left neglected for years. This Ghost town is approximately a 45-minute drive outside Las Vegas.

What My Least Favorite Destinations & Olives Have In Common,"There aren’t many things I truly hate in this world. In fact, olives might be the only one. I’ve tried to eat olives, I really have, at least a dozen times throughout my life. But ever since I was a child, the only reactions I can remember having to even a tiny bit of olive is gagging and making a genuinely disgusted face. Sometimes I’ve even gagged before I’ve taken a bite, just when the olive hit my lips or began to enter my mouth. The thought of olives right now has just made me cringe. I don’t even know why I’m writing about them. One of my good friends loves olives. She loves olives so much, and I hate them so much, that we have had lengthy discussions about these little oval things. I think I can even remember one time when we actually started arguing about them.

Eurail Adventure: Vienna to Ljubljana,"The second leg of my train trip around Europe involved a somewhat shorter, and no less comfortable, international journey than the first leg. Starting off at Vienna’s Meidling station, I found myself on a Maribor-bound train sitting in a near-empty compartment, something that came as quite a relief. The day before, when I had visited the ticket office at the train station to reserve my space, I was informed that, with myEurail Pass, all I needed to do was show up. Apparently, I did not need to book an actual seat ahead of time. While this information did come straight from the ticket office itself, I was still a little weary as I had been required to book a seat for my earlier train trip fromLucerne to Vienna. Well, of course the ticket office was correct and I had dozens of empty seats to choose from.

What’s In The Closet…A Look At Everything I Own,"A few weeks ago, a reader of the site wrote an email asking me an interesting question. He asked me whether or not I owned anything besides what I carry around with me in my backpack. Am I a true minimalist attempting to live life with fewer than 100 possessions at all times or do I actually have an apartment or huge storage space somewhere that is overflowing with stuff? First, let me describe what I do carry inside of my backpack. It’s basically a collection of some clothes (shorts, pants, shirts, underwear, socks), toiletries, sandals and shoes, laptop, Kindle,Panasonic Lumix ZS20(the perfect travel camera in my opinion), small bag of necessary chargers/wires for my devices, a travel towel, water bottle and a flashlight.

The Night I Died In A Cafe,"My friend picked me up in front of my apartment building and we immediately drove off, away from the hustle and chaos of the big city. Avoiding the highway, we took quiet country roads instead, moving at a slow speed through a hilly landscape followed by what appeared to be a large forest of sequoia trees. After a long time had passed, we eventually found ourselves at a junction, where we had to choose which way to turn. I soon noticed a semi-hidden sign on the other side of the road that consisted of nothing more than a hand-drawn black arrow pointing to the right. And so off we went in that direction. Within a few minutes, we approached a small picturesque village, the kind which you expect to find in the south of France or in the hills of Tuscany.

Wandering Earl: Live From Here! (New Travel Video Series),"After a bit of thinking recently, I realized that the time has come for me to….eat more pickles. I love pickles and it’s just a shame that I haven’t been eating them as much as I would like as of late. Oops…sorry about that. The pickle thing was for another post I was planning on writing. What I meant to say here is that the time has come for me to…integrate more video into this blog. That’s right, more travel video to go along with all of the written posts I publish.

Eurail Adventure: Sibiu to Bucharest,"After having made the sudden decision to return to Bucharest and not continue further into Transylvania, my next step was to walk over to the train station and book a seat on a train. I had several options to get from Sibiu to the capital but most of them took over 8 hours and arrived at the most inconvenient of times. So after spending ten minutes reviewing my options with the ticket woman behind the counter, whose frustration at my inability to choose a departure time grew exponentially by the second, I chose the third fastest train of the day, only because it was the only direct train that arrived at a decent hour. The next afternoon, at 2:45pm, I sat down in a window seat on that train, having made it on board only one minute before the train left.

"18 Days in a Super Beautiful, Remote Part of Mexico","Last month, I spent 18 days in a secluded, remote part of Mexico. A friend and I were covering another friend’s housesitting assignment while he and his wife were away. The house we took care of was quite isolated. On one side was an endless, empty white sand beach and gorgeous water for as far as you could see. On the other side was an immense span of jungle stretching all the way to Alaska, or so it seemed. Nothing else at all for the most part. A potholed dirt road was the only way in and out. The closest town was 25 kms away. When we arrived in the area, my first thought was, ‘okay, this should be nice’. Of course, at that moment, I had no idea just how spectacular the experience of being surrounded by nature for the first time in a while would actually be.

Walking Holidays Across Spain,"At the heart of walking holidays in Spain lies the Camino de Santiago – Pilgrimage of Compostela – known as the Way of St James in English. This is a network of pilgrim paths dating back to the 9th century, when the remains of the apostle Saint James the Great were discovered, in which different towns and villages across Europe all lead back to Santiago, Spain. AlthoughCamino de Santiago Francesbegins in France, these routes all end in Spain. For this reason, Spain has become a very popular walking holiday destination, in which holidaymakers and hikers from around the world dive into a segmented route within one of the pilgrim paths.

Instead, when I was 22 years old I took a gamble that ended up paying off, giving me the financial means to live a nomadic lifestyle of steady travel for the past 10 years.

And that’s why I ended up visiting Targoviste, an old Wallachian capital that was built in the 12th century during the Second Bulgarian Empire.

So, there I stood, my courage starting to fade, wondering how I was going to find a hotel and why I hadn’t booked a room in advance. I eventually found the official taxi stand, hopped into a taxi and, because I had no specific hotel or guesthouse address to give to the driver, told him to take me to Khao San Road, an area I had only heard about from a friend of a friend a week before I left home.

Here’s how it works: I send a message to the host before I make a booking. Yes, I write the host a message, and as you’ll see below, there’s a good reason for it.

How to Get Massive Hotel Discounts (it’s easy and free),"This is a simple one. In my never ending search for ways to get the best deals on all things travel related, I recently came across a website that makes it remarkably easy to get massive hotel discounts.

Then, when some of those bulk rooms aren’t used, this website makes them available to everyone in order to avoid losing money. The result is that regular travelers like us can actually take advantage of these hotel discounts at hotels all over the world. That’s really all there is to it, andit works.

How Much It Costs To Travel In Syria,"Now that I’ve been here for just under a month, I have a decent grasp on how much it costs to travel in Syria.

If you move up a notch and stay in private single or double rooms, eat a sit-down meal more often and use taxis to get around, you can travel here for about $25 – $30 USD per day.

During 2013, I continued using some stuff that I have been using for a long time and I’ve also discovered some more stuff that has made my life a little easier or more enjoyable.

Am I Destined To Wander The World All Alone?,"Having just woken up from a night’s sleep on my rock bed inside the cave where I am now staying, a remote cave far, far away from any civilization, I think I’ll head outside for a walk. Of course, since I woke up alone, as I always do, I’ll just wander down to the river by myself, sit down on the grassy riverbank, toss small stones into the cool water and become lost in my thoughts. Chances are I won’t even speak today, but that’s alright, because I’m used to it. Rarely do I meet or talk to anyone during my wanderings, no matter where I am. The truth is, a life of travel requires me to accept an isolated, lonely existence, and nothing else. Sure, it would be nice to have a companion, a partner, a girlfriend, someone to share my wanderings and my life with.

Announcing my “Wandering Earl Tours” for 2015,"It began as a simple idea back in 2012. I decided to offer a tour to India. Without much planning, actually, no planning at all, I randomly announced that first tour right here on the blog. It sold out in less than 48 hours. I said, “Oh my”. Then I spent the next couple of months running around, organizing and planning every aspect of that tour right up until the last minute. November arrived, the tour began in Delhi and just like that,Wandering Earl Tourswas in action. Things seem to have gone well since then as requests for more tours starting coming in. Now I’ve run three trips to India already. Not to mention trips to Romania, Istanbul, Mexico and Southeast Asia as well.

The goal of this series is to share my responses to many of the emails I receive from readers just in case more of you may have the very same questions on your mind.

I have a chance to stay at home for the next three months and save $2000 more before traveling, or I could just take the money I have now and start my journey.

Mexico: Secrets from a Cesspool,"Here in Mexico…it’s all dust and drugs…as well as deadly swine flu outbreaks, unrelenting violence, incessant corruption, dangerous third-world transportation, stomach-churning tacos and poisonous drinking water. It’s really just one giant cesspool of a travel destination if you ask me. That is why I urge you, every single one of you, to stay away…as far away as you possibly can. I’m saying this because I care. It is your personal health and safety that are my topmost priorities. So just stay away. Yep, that’s right…it’s a cesspool… …full of excrement… …nothing pleasant about it. Hey…are you still there? Excellent. I actually want to share a little secret with you, but I needed to get rid of all the other readers first.

I Barely Survived My Visit To Ukraine,"My apologies for the lack of activity as of late. I arrived in the city of Lviv, Ukraine back on July 29th and I’ve been in the country ever since. However, I have also been quite sick during that entire time unfortunately. It all started the day after I arrived – a cold, a temperature, body aches, sore throat, cough – and while the symptoms began to subside by about my fourth day in town, they all became much worse soon after. And so, four days ago, I found myself in the beautiful village of Kosmach, Ukraine, in the Carpathian Mountains, unable to get out of bed at the family-owned guesthouse where I was staying. It was a real shame actually because I was very much looking forward to exploring this part of the country and I had a nice itinerary of activities lined up for me as well.

Playa del Carmen: Such A Good Place To Live,"When many people think of Playa del Carmen, Mexico, they automatically think of a heavily touristed party destination for Americans. As a result, it’s no surprise that many independent travelers don’t really have a desire to visit this town at all. However, every now and then, some independent travelers do end up here, usually when en route to or from Central America, and of course, most of these travelers, at least the ones I’ve met, typically have the same initial reaction upon arrival. “Playa del Carmen is not for me.” And I can understand that. For those in search of wild adventures in new and exotic lands, seeing a gringo as soon as you get off the bus, one wearing an over-sized sombrero while inhaling a constant stream of beer from a neon purple, 3-foot long plastic drinking vessel, is not a good start.

Why I Don’t Plan To Visit Every Country In The World,"As excited as I am when I first step foot into a country I’ve never visited before, I must not deny the fact that there is also a part of me that, these days, just wants to travel to countries that I’ve already been to, countries that I can’t get out of my mind because of the life-changing experiences I had during my first, or in some cases, second visit. But it’s not always easy to do that because human beings love competition and when it comes to traveling, the most common competition (even if it’s not a formal one) tends to revolve around the ‘country count’, the overall number of countries that a traveler has visited. This number is brought up in many a conversation while on the road and of course, the higher the number, the more impressive a particular traveler appears (or thinks they appear).

Why I Traveled To Yemen For My Vacation,"A few weeks ago, I decided that I needed to take a vacation. I just needed to get offline for a while and take a short break from the blog. I don’t take such breaks often but a little time away every now and then sure seems like a wise idea in order to keep me fresh and motivated as much as possible. So, I began brainstorming potential vacation destinations, thinking long and hard about where I should go… Perhaps a simple hut on a white sand beach or a quiet mountain retreat? Maybe some picturesque European town or Melbourne, Australia, where many of my friends live? Nope.

As we sat at an outdoor cafe in the old city center discussing a variety of topics, at one point, both Johnny and Ian mentioned that upon first impression, the people of Bucharest seemed so very friendly. I quickly nodded in agreement because that has been my experience as well during the five months I’ve spent on and off in this city.

Unfortunately, this South Pacific nation has been hit with some severe flooding over the past week due to a series of storms, including a cyclone, that passed over the area. As a result, the country is not in any condition to host a group of travel bloggers as they deal with much more pressing matters. Actually, the press trip hasn’t been canceled. It’s just been re-scheduled but because of some other commitments I have back in Europe, there’s a good chance I won’t be able to participate with the new dates.

How To Travel Overland To Iraq (Kurdistan),"Now that I know you’re interested in possibly wanting to travel overland to Iraq (right?), I thought it might be helpful to provide a detailed guide on how to get there. Sure, there’s always the option of simply flying directly into the regional capital of Erbil, with semi-frequent flights now operating from destinations within both Europe and the Middle East. Such airlines as Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa, Royal Jordanian,FlyDubaiandAtlas Jetall offer service in and out of Iraqi Kurdistan these days. However, dishing out $500+ USD for a return flight from Istanbul to Erbil might not be too appealing for those with a budget traveler’s bank account and besides, for those with a little more time or perhaps adventurous spirit, going overland is an option you might want to consider.

In the 15 years I had been alive at that point, I had never broken any part of my body and so, upon seeing my friend, I couldn’t help but wonder what it felt like to break a bone. In fact, I spent most of that school day wondering how it must feel and I didn’t stop thinking about it after school either. That night, moments before I went to bed, I even took it so far as to wish that I would break a bone myself.

However, three weeks later, I still had yet to leave Romania. My experiences from Transylvania to Bucharest made me want to skip Bulgaria altogether, which is what I decided to do. The natural conclusion from this decision would be that I found it extremely difficult to leave Romania, a conclusion that would be quite true, although, for reasons that you might not expect.

How To Eat A Mexican Tostada (Video),"Today’s post offers an instructional video of sorts. While at first it may seem completely pointless to demonstrate how to eat something as basic as a Mexican tostada, I have simply watched too many foreigners struggle with this staple of Mexican cuisine to remain silent any longer. What is interesting is that the actual technique used to eat a tostada is not too important at all. What is important is being able to search deep within one’s self in order to summon the courage necessary to conquer the fear. What fear? The fear of making a fool of oneself.

How To Travel Long Distances For Little Money,"When I first began researching how I was going to get from Bucharest to Ulcinj, Montenegro, the first destination of my upcoming trip to the Balkans, I started off by checking airfares. I figured that flying there would just be the easiest method and considering that the distance is a lengthy, but reasonable, 850 kms / 470 miles between the two places, how expensive could the airfare be? Well, the answer turned out to be ‘very expensive’. My initial airfare searches gave me fares of around $500 USD one way. And all I needed was a one-way ticket because my return route would be overland, with stops in Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, Serbia and Bulgaria along the way. And not only were the flight options $500 or more, they all involved one or two stops and total durations ranging from 10 to 23 hours.

I Love Las Vegas and I’m Not Ashamed,"I love Las Vegas. I love it so much in fact that I made sure I included a visit to Las Vegas on the itinerary for my recent road trip around the Western USA back in December. That itinerary also included visiting a good friend of mine in Los Angeles, a couple of days wandering around Santa Barbara, a drive along the California coast through Big Sur, a stop in beautiful Monterey and some days in San Francisco. It was a very nice trip, and I enjoyed every destination, but when the trip was over, the destination that stood out the most was Las Vegas. And it had nothing to do with gambling. I did not win big. I actually barely gambled and in the four days I was in Vegas, I think I lost about $100 USD on the slot machines and never really had an urge to gamble...","January 13th, 2014",https://wanderingearl.com/i-love-las-vegas-not-ashamed/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

Wandering Earl Tours for 2017,"Since 2012, I’ve been running myWandering Earl Toursas a side project through this blog, offering unique, small group tours to countries around the world. I’ve now welcomed 190 people on a variety of trips to all corners of the globe. This is not some big tour company of course. I don’t make contracts with tourist hotels, I don’t pre-plan every single aspect and I don’t create rushed itineraries that only allow you to take a couple of photos before being forced to move on. It’s just a small operation, with a focus on laid-back travel, learning through first-hand experiences and diving into a country beyond the main sights. It’s also about having a blast together, meeting people, eating great food and having free time to experience each destination in your own way…and of course, keeping it at a reasonable price.

Taxes for Travelers Abroad: 5 Things You Need To Know,"Americans sure love to travel. Over45 millionAmericans traveled abroad in 2019 – some of them for business, others for pleasure. And while the pandemic has dampened those numbers, the need to experience the sights and sounds of the world remains. Whether you’re traveling for business or pleasure, here’s a quick tax guide to get you started. Yes! A few have even decided to make the most of the ongoing situation to travel the world. In an effort to boost flagging visitor numbers, some countries such asEstoniaandBermudahave offered special visas for Americans who want to temporarily work abroad.

In Search Of Two Mosques (Without A Map),"Luckily, there’s no shortage of places to explore in this city known as Istanbul, so when I arrived at the Grand Bazaar yesterday morning only to discover that it is closed on Sundays, I knew that my day would by no means be a failure. In fact, given that the sun was actually shining for the first time in a while, it suddenly seemed to be the perfect day to visit two different mosques that had been recommended to me. This mosque is perhaps the most elusive in all of Istanbul. Despite several locals informing me that a visit to Hirka-i Serif was a must (in order to view the Holy Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed), nobody could tell me where it was actually located. Time and time again, all I kept hearing was that it could be found “somewhere in the Fatih section of the city.” Well, yesterday, that...","October 11th, 2010",https://wanderingearl.com/in-search-of-two-mosques-without-a-map/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Is This The Worst or The Best Hotel in Mumbai?,"One of the most important things about travel, something that every person should understand before they set off on their adventures, is that no two people will ever have the same experiences. What one person will love, another won’t enjoy at all. What one person feels is a ‘must-see’ place, another person will label ‘not worth visiting’. There are simply too many personal factors involved with travel in order for a concrete conclusion to be reached about any particular destination. I doubt there is anywhere on this planet that every single traveler agrees upon in terms of liking or disliking it. It just doesn’t happen, not when we all have our own individual likes and dislikes, our own interests, our own needs and comfort levels, our own beliefs and interpretations, and on and on. Such differences in opinion obviously extends to activities, cuisine and of course, accommodation as well.

How to Save Money with Uber (quick and easy),"When I travel, I use Uber and other similar ride-sharing apps from time to time. The reason is convenience, ease and in most places, the ability to save money with Uber over using taxis. Let’s go back to three weeks ago. I stood on a street corner in the Romanian city of Timisoara. My phone was in my hand and I opened theUberapp. I typed in my destination and an estimate of the fare was shown on the screen. However, I noticed that the fare was more than double the fare I had paid for that exact same trip 2 hours earlier. Why? Right there on the app it explained, “Due to increased demand, fares are significantly higher.” Intriguing. I looked more closely at theUberscreen. And I saw that there were only 3 Uber vehicles operating at that moment in Timisoara.

A South African Township & My Zulu Warrior Dance,"Some travelers do it, many don’t and in my opinion, every traveler should. I’m talking about paying a visit to a South African township. Created during the Apartheid era, these communities, typically located on the outskirts of towns and cities, were designed to house the ‘non-whites’ who were living in what were then designated as ‘white-only’ parts of the country. Of course, these individuals were forcibly removed from their homes and placed into these segregated townships, most of which suffered from a severe lack of basic services. Today, millions of people live in these townships as a result and there is apparently still some forced relocation taking place as the government tries to move people out of the shanty towns that still exist. And while some townships have fared well and even include a growing middle-class, the majority are still suffering from poor infrastructure and problems with education, among other...","December 24th, 2011",https://wanderingearl.com/a-south-african-township-my-zulu-warrior-dance/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Do Budget Travelers Travel In Comfort Or In Poverty?,"I’m always telling people that $1000 per month is more than enough money to travel around the majority of the world. There’s even been a few times on this blog that I’ve mentioned $500 being enough to travel, and travel relatively well, around certain regions. But there is a problem with such claims and that problem lies right there in the previous sentence. What on earth does ‘relatively well’ really mean? The more I think about it, the more that I realize that what is ‘relatively well’ for me might be absolutely miserable to someone else, or on the other end of the spectrum, my traveling style may even seem luxurious to others. And because of the wide range of possibilities that ‘relatively well’ may represent, any post I write about how much money I spend while traveling or how inexpensive traveling can be is nowhere near complete if I...","September 13th, 2011",https://wanderingearl.com/do-budget-travelers-travel-in-comfort/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

I positioned my feet and held the golf club firmly, but not too tight. I stared out at the stretch of green in front of me and took a few deep breaths.

Perhaps it’s the ‘high’ of travel, the over-excitement of visiting someplace new or returning home after some time away, that is too much for us to handle. Our brains flutter, sending abnormal signals to the rest or our bodies, causing us to do such things as walk at a speed of 42 miles per hour through the terminal while talking on the phone and trying to complete a sudoku puzzle at the same time.

“Anything You Need” – Could This Girl Be For Real?,"Her name is Keren. Not Karen. Keren. And I must tell you, she is absolutely lovely. It took a long time for me to find her but now that I have, I anticipate that we will be quite close for quite some time. Already we email each other almost every day and we even talk on the telephone once in a while. The first thing she ever wrote to me was, “Anything you need, I am here for you.” And she even added a colon/parenthesis-created smile at the end. Does it get any better than that? To have someone so attentive to your needs and so dedicated to keeping you happy at all times is something that few people get to truly experience. But now, my friends, I have entered that sweet realm of bliss, I have joined those selected few. And it’s even more rewarding than I could’ve ever...","November 19th, 2009",https://wanderingearl.com/anything-you-need-could-this-girl-be-for-real/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Travel Photography: My Terrible Photos Of Europe,"This is the second post of a relatively new series called “Terrible Photos” in which I openly share with you some of the terrible photos I’ve taken during my travels. I do not try and hide the fact that my photographic skills are not very well developed at all. And for anyone who might have read the first post in this series –Terrible Photos of the Middle East– you should be well aware of what’s in store for you with this post… There is nothing quite like a shot of the Adriatic Sea, with a stretch of land in the background and with the leaves of a beautiful, lush green, exotic-looking tree acting as a frame for the entire scene. There’s also nothing quite like a similar shot in which the leaves of such a tree almost completely cover up the scene, leaving the land in the background barely visible....","July 23rd, 2011",https://wanderingearl.com/travel-photography-terrible-photos-europe/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Why I Made a List of Memorable Life Experiences This Morning,Have you ever created a list of the first 50 or so most memorable life experiences that pop into your head when you think back over your years? I woke up this morning and felt the urge to do just that. This is what I came up with… Taking a shower in a small wooden closet down a tiny alley in Kabul every morning during my stay. It was a local hamam where most of the residents in the area bathed each day. Finding everyone I met in Tirana to be so welcoming – from waitstaff to the hostel staff to strangers in the street to shop owners. Especially the shop owner who not only let me charge my phone in his shop but insisted that I go eat at his favorite restaurant nearby while my phone was charging. He even called the restaurant to let them know I was...,"October 29th, 2015",https://wanderingearl.com/why-i-made-a-list-of-memorable-life-experiences-this-morning/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Renting A Short-Term Apartment While Traveling,"As I mention on this blog, in terms of accommodation, I typically stay in hostels, guesthouses or budget hotels when I’m traveling. And those options have worked quite well for me over the years, which is exactly why, when I decided to spend my week-long vacation in Ulcinj, Montenegro, I started looking for guesthouses and budget hotels as I normally do. There were some decent budget options, all of which cost around $15 or $20 per person, but for some reason I had trouble making a decision. And so, I spent even more time on the internet, hoping that the perfect place for my friend and I to stay during this vacation (I don’t alwaystravel alone!) would suddenly pop up onto my screen.

eSIM Card for Travel to Japan,"Are you ready to travel to Japan? Or perhaps you’re thinking about taking a trip to this fascinating country? If that’s the case, you definitely want to figure out a way to stay connected while you’re overseas. Things are changing quite quickly when it comes to this topic but luckily, it’s now remarkably easy, and inexpensive, to travel with a constant data connection. It’s all about eSIM cards as they are definitely the most traveler friendly option that exists. An eSIM is different than your usual SIM card that you would insert into your phone. Usually, your cellular company provides you with a physical SIM card and once inserted into your device, you are connected to their network. With an eSIM, there is no physical card. Instead, it’s 100% digital, enabling you to connect to a cellular network without having to put anything in your phone’s SIM card slot.

"You Should Visit Riga, Latvia…It’s Quite Pleasant","Only one word enters my head when I think of the time I just spent in Riga, Latvia. And that word is ‘pleasant’. I’ve tried, but that’s the only word I can use to describe it, so much so that originally, this post was just going to say “Riga is pleasant” and nothing more. Of course, my inability to describe this Baltic city more thoroughly might have something to do with the fact that I only spent an embarrassingly short two nights and two and a half days in Riga. More time is obviously needed in order to get a proper feel for a particular destination. But alas, I shall write about the experiences I did have in those short 60 hours, simple experiences that once again, led me to reach the profound conclusion that Riga, Latvia is….pleasant.

Halloween In Transylvania: My Lucky Graveyard Escape,"The fact that I ended up celebrating Halloween in Transylvania was a complete accident as, after twelve years of traveling, I barely remember when most holidays take place. I had actually forgotten that Halloween was nearly upon us when, just about ten days ago, a fellow traveler I met in Belgrade happened to ask what my Halloween plans were while in Romania. Fast forward to 6pm on October 31st and I find myself, along with fellow travelers Jerry (Mexico) and Margunn (Norway), walking out of my guesthouse in the medieval town of Sighisoara, located in the heart of Transylvania.

"Camping, Kangaroos & A Fine Looking Teepee","For the past two nights I slept in a teepee. This wasn’t any ordinary teepee either. It was the TeePee 2000, the mother of all modern day teepees, built with such skill and precision and with the comfort of potential inhabitants carefully considered with every stitch. A friend of mine here in Sydney told me the story of how he and three others wandered into a Sydney Kmart one day and upon seeing the TeePee 2000 for the very first time, decided on the spot to split the $40 investment among them. And ever since that moment some three years ago, that teepee has accompanied him on every camping trip he has ever taken. So naturally, the reason why I was sleeping in a TeePee 2000 this weekend is because I was camping. I know that might not sound so natural given my recent rant about the combination ofcamping and...","February 21st, 2011",https://wanderingearl.com/camping-kangaroos-a-fine-looking-teepee/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

I always reply and usually, my response starts off with something like: That question equates to asking – how can I become an office worker? They are both very broad categories (and goals) that don’t really offer a direct path or set of defined steps to reach them. They both exist but they are both merely outer shells. What matters most is what you fill them with inside. What is inside? A job. A way to earn money. Here’s the truth – the term “digital nomad” is not a job. It’s a lifestyle.

A Little Human Connection Goes A Long Way,"It happens to all of us when we travel. We walk down a street and before we know it, people are approaching us, locals who are trying to sell us something we don’t need or trying to convince us to eat there or sleep here or to join a day trip somewhere. Maybe they want us to exchange money at their shop, have our shoes shined, eat their street food or buy their blankets. You get the idea. Foreigners are targets and as a result, we often have to deal with people trying to convince us to part ways with our money. Our typical reaction when we encounter these situations is to often put our head down and keep on moving, ignoring the pleas and sales pitches and promises.

After all, when I think back to the actual places I’ve traveled to or lived during 2010, the first thing that always pops into my head are the people that made those visits so rewarding.

However, the more I traveled, the more the answer to such a question eventually did become quite clear.

Perhaps India would no longer excite me. Perhaps I would find the intensity and chaos to be too much for me these days. Perhaps I’d be better to just stick with the memories of my previous visits and not try to relive my experiences.

"Vienna, Austria: What On Earth Is A Heuriger?","One does not need to spend much time in the city of Vienna to understand the reasoning behind it’s constant ranking as one of the world’s most liveable cities. I needed only about four minutes to make this discovery myself as, from the moment I stepped off the train upon arrival, I found myself to be a much greater fan of this city than I would have ever imagined. I will state that I had some luck on my side, as I was picked up at the Wien Westbanhof train station by none other thanFabian Kruseand his good friend Rudi.

How to Have the Most Rewarding Time While Visiting Kyoto,"While every place on our beautiful planet is a sight to behold, some are simply magical, such as the city of Kyoto. Standing as the monument to the imperial age of Japan for over a millennium, Kyoto is the very lifeblood of traditional Japanese culture. Naturally, the list of everything you can do and see in Kyoto is as long. Vermillion shrines and golden temples to graceful tea ceremonies, spiritual quests, swaying bamboo forests and taking mind-soothing strolls through Zen rock gardens – Kyoto is more like a place from another dimension. The city is swarming with tradition, culture, rich history and architecture. Shrines and temples, wooden treehouses, luscious forests, peaceful gardens and shimmering pavilions are just the tip of the iceberg. From top food to deep spirituality, Kyoto takes you on a journey where you’ll get to know its history and people and get in touch with your inner...","November 1st, 2021",https://wanderingearl.com/most-rewarding-time-while-visiting-kyoto/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

The Night I Felt The Powerful Vibe Of South Africa,"Forget about the wildlife. Forget about the wines and the mesmerizing coastline.

This post is going to highlight another aspect of South Africa, an aspect that probably had more of an impact on me than any of the others during my recent visit. I’m talking about theENERGYbaby! Before I arrived in South Africa, I had heard from several travelers that as soon as one arrives in the country, you can instantly ‘feel’ Africa. You can feel the vibe, feel the life, feel that energy. And I felt it alright.

How To Avoid Being Broke & Lost Once You Stop Traveling,"You want to travel, you save up some money, you buy your flight and off you go. And then, chances are, it all works out even better than you planned and you end up on the road for maybe a year or two years or even longer. Once your initial funds were depleted, you simply found work overseas in order to save up some more money. You taught English in Asia, you picked fruit in Australia and you worked in a bar or hostel in a couple of locations in Europe. You explored two dozen countries, you checked off many of the places on your personal ‘must-visit’ list, you met new friends all over the world and you never have even a single moment of regret about taking off on such a long-term travel adventure.

I checked the system and the payment had indeed gone through. This had never happened before. I concluded that it must be a fluke.

How To Travel The World For $1.94 Per Day,"Wait. Is this really possible? No. Well, yes. Well, maybe. If you look at travel as most of us do, an activity that involves the standard transportation, accommodation, sampling of the local cuisine and visiting sights and attractions, then it’ll be somewhat of a challenge to even imagine how your daily spending budget could be as low as $1.94 per day. However, if you’re able to approach travel from an entirely different perspective, you may suddenly find it difficult to understand how you could possibly spend MORE than $1.94 per day during your adventure. As for me, I have months where I spend well over $1000 USD and I have months where I spend well under that amount. While I don’t maintain a strict travel budget and I don’t watch every dollar I spend, I would estimate that during some months, I may only spend $300 USD or so.

It is true that the majority of my income these days is earned online and without my laptop, I simply wouldn’t be able to maintain my nomadic lifestyle. Of course, that probably doesn’t come as much of a surprise to most of you, because, after all, if you spend even just a few minutes reading a handful of thetraveland lifestyle design blogs out there, it would be natural to reach the conclusion that the only way to become a nomad these days is to become a digital version of one.

The Taxis of Kabul,"The fact that Kabul lacks anything resembling efficient planning and the fact that street signs are as common as synagogues (there is one!), naturally leads one to believe that tackling this metropolis by foot would be a foolish endeavor. Certainly it would be much easier to jump into one of the 40,000 registered taxis driving around the city, pay the ridiculously cheap fare and enjoy a comfortable ride to your next destination. However, as any visitor to Kabul quickly discovers, one’s feet, despite the never-ending maze of nameless roads and the abundance of heavily-armed citizens, are infinitely more reliable than any local taxi you’ll find. I learned this lesson during my first day in the city, after being forced to ride in four different taxis. The problem was that I didn’t use four different taxis to reach four different destinations.

But then a friend recommended the area around Serra da Estrela National Park and we immediately loved the idea. I honestly think we put this Portugal road trip together in about 10 minutes. We simply wanted to get out into nature and if a friend said this area was worth visiting, that was good enough. We booked a rental car and a hotel and four days later we were ready.

However, I shall not use the word ‘pleasant’ to describe my time in Tallinn – a tiny capital city of only 450,000, located in a tiny country of only 1.5 million people – because despite its miniscule size, this city managed to not only keep me extremely busy throughout my stay, it managed to keep me intrigued and excited, and always wanting to see and do more, as well.

How To Avoid Being Ripped Off By Taxi Drivers,"It happens. Travelers get ripped off. And it happens often. One of the most common ways of getting ripped off involves taking local transportation and sometimes it seems as if we spend hours every single day trying to negotiate taxi or rickshaw or tuk-tuk fares wherever we go. And somehow, no matter how hard we try, we almost always end up paying infinitely higher prices than locals. Of course, as soon as we find ourselves being ripped off by taxi drivers or once we learn that we paid much more than other travelers for the same journey, we are oh-so-quick to place all of the blame on the evil taxi or tuk-tuk or bicycle rickshaw driver who took our money.

In between songs, when the lead singer spoke a few words into the microphone, I waited for the crowd’s reaction and followed suit. Sometimes we cheered, other times we screamed and sometimes we applauded politely. When the crowd swayed from side to side during a slower song, I swayed from side to side too.

Do You Need A University Degree To Travel Long-Term?,"The quick answer to this question – do you need a university degree to travel? – is of course a big fat ‘no’. It’s not as if you’ll be asked for your university diploma when entering a new country and you certainly won’t need to show proof of extended study in order to check into a hostel or hotel.

Then some university students spend long hours wondering if they should just drop out and chase after their travel goals without graduating. When the road calls, the call is powerful and it’s only natural that it often lures people away from three...","February 4th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/do-you-need-a-university-degree-to-travel-long-term/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
42 Ways You Can Make Money and Travel the World,"Have you ever asked yourself, “How will I possibly make money while traveling?” or “How will I survive on the road?” or maybe “How can I can’t start traveling when I don’t have much money?”. Chances are that these very thoughts have indeed crossed your mind (they cross all of our minds at some point!) and there’s also a chance that you haven’t found any answers. As a result, you’ve still yet to take that first step and start traveling and as time passes by, you start to wonder if you’ll ever achieve your travel goals. Here on the blog I’m always making the claim that you can make money and travel much more easily than most people think. But yesterday I realized that I should probably back up that claim with some actual examples. So, that’s what I want to do here. I want to help you answer those...","February 18th, 2013",https://wanderingearl.com/42-ways-you-can-make-money-and-travel-the-world/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Why Me No Fluent In Any Language At All,"Thank you, travel. For it is you who has turned me into a man who is fluent, not in two languages, nor three languages, and not even four languages. Alas, as a result of constantly bouncing around the world, far and wide, for over a decade, I can proudly declare that I am now fully fluent in…zero languages. That’s right, I’m not fluent in any language on the planet. Yes, at one time I was indeed fluent in English, my mother tongue, but as the years passed by and I spent more and more time in lands where English was not the language of choice, my ability to speak it began to diminish.

My Robot-Like Approach to Travel and Life,"If you dare me to do something, I’ll do it, whatever it involves.

If you told me I won a two month trip to the South Pacific, to bounce around from island to island, all expenses paid, I’d probably nod once and say, “Alright.” If you told me that my leg is broken and as a result I can’t travel for a year or more, my reaction would also most likely be, “Alright.” Many people tell me that I’m a mystery, that they have no idea what I’m thinking at any time, what I’m feeling or what’s going on in my head.

Why I Shouldn’t Complain About Wet Socks,"This morning I was forced to dry my underwear and socks in the microwave. It all began when I had the unfortunate timing of washing a load of laundry at the exact same moment that the rain started to fall here in Melbourne. And that was five days ago. For the most part, the rain has been falling ever since. So, when I hung up my laundry to dry on the clothes rack, they naturally didn’t dry, but instead, remained completely damp until they began to stink up the house where I am staying. As a result, I had to wash all of my clothes again, but afterward, with the rain continuing to fall, they still would not dry.

And so, the gang here in India, those ten bold souls who have decided to partake in this excursion, have now been armed with a few such items.

And with that trip, I shall say a big goodbye to all the countries in Europe as I won’t be back before the end of the year. I’ve actually spent a decent amount of time traveling around Europe in 2017 though, much more than usual. I think it’s been 12 countries. My European experiences began back in February when I flew from Miami to India, changing planes in Frankfurt. I had a long 6 hour layover there, most of which I spent half-asleep in one of the airport lounges (thanks to the Priority Pass that comes with my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card).

Romania Road Trip – Part 1: Bucovina & Maramures!,"I’m a major road trip fan.

Discover Europe’s Best River Cruise Adventures,"Embarking on a river cruise through Europe offers an unparalleled way to explore the continent’s rich history, culture, and breathtaking landscapes. As travelers glide along tranquil waterways, they’re treated to ever-changing vistas of picturesque towns, rolling vineyards, and iconic landmarks. This mode of travel has a profound influence on how visitors experience Europe, allowing them to unpack once and wake up in a new destination each day.

All You Need to Know About Traveling by Bus in Italy,"Italy is a beautiful country with a rich culture, history, and cuisine.

Bus travel in Italy has many advantages over other ways of getting around the country, like trains, cars, or planes. Some of the benefits of bus travel in Italy are: However, as it has several benefits, it also has drawbacks, like being a lot slower than other ways of getting around.

And even though this goal was virtually created out of thin air, I clung to it during the rest of my youth.

I think the initial problem was that the post I had almost finished was somewhat on the serious side, and today, my mood is far from being serious. From the moment I woke up this morning, I’ve been a bit more goofy than normal, evident by the number of times I pretended to do the backstroke while singing my new (but old) favorite song,The Swimming Song, by Loudon Wainwright.

My Name is Matcha and This is My Incredible Story!,"Oh my. I just watched the sunrise from the highest platform of my super fun cat tower.

My name is Matcha, by the way.I’m this little domestic short haired cat from Bali and boy do I have a story to tell! __ It all began when I was born I guess. It’s a bit fuzzy but I was born and suddenly, when I was only 5 days old,someone left me in the jungle in Bali.

The Simplest Hotel In The World,"For some reason, this morning, just seconds after waking up, I started thinking about an elderly Indian man. But this was not just any elderly Indian man, he was the owner of a small hotel, the simplest hotel you’ve ever seen, in the tiny Ladakhi village of Mulbekh, located some three days north of Delhi by car or bus, and at an altitude of 3500 meters, way up in the heart of the Himalayas. It’s embarrassing to admit but I don’t know this man’s name despite having spent two nights at his hotel some years ago. And while I certainly don’t remember the names of all the hotel and guesthouse owners I’ve met over the years, my stay at this particular hotel was a particularly memorable one… When I hopped off the bus in Mulbekh, it did not take long at all for me to learn that this 5500-person village...","April 20th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/the-simplest-hotel-in-the-world/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Do You Have Enough Confidence to Travel? You Should.,"You’re ready to travel. You even bought a backpack. You told your friends that you’re taking off within the next few months. You have a general itinerary and you can’t wait to get on that airplane. But you also know that your travels probably won’t happen in the end.You’re fully aware that despite the excitement of travel, despite your desire to get out there and see the world, you just don’t have the necessary confidence to actually do it. I remember it well. I remember telling everyone I knew that I was leaving to go traveling for 3 months back in 1999.

That’s right…Mexico, the country I left overtwo months ago, and the country to which I assumed I would not be returning to any time soon. But that’s how life works and given the fact that I’m still unable to depart for my adventure to the Middle East (as a result of my ongoing dental issue), I see no reason why I need to avoid being immersed in a foreign culture. Basically, until this frustrating dental problem of mine is cleared up, I’m unable to stray too far from Florida.

Despite having been traveling for 15 years, despite doing things like spending time inFrance,Romania, Singapore, India,Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Turkey and more during the first half of this year…when August came around, nothing made sense to me.

However, I’ve now realized that I don’t want a DSLR and I have no interest in carrying around larger pieces of equipment.

Affordable Canadian Cities For Digital Nomads,"Many major Canadian cities are fast becoming the most expensive places in the world to live.

Likewise, Vancouver is similarly priced, and whilst these cities have incredible amenities, the point of being a digital nomad is to be free from living in areas that we cannot afford. So, when looking atflights to Canada, make sure you decide on the city that is right for you.

"A Relaxing Beach Vacation in Ulcinj, Montenegro","When I decided to start my trip to the Balkans with a ten day vacation from the blog, I began searching for an ideal beach town in Montenegro where I could do nothing but relax. At the time, I admittedly knew very little about Montenegro and as I did some research, I found it quite difficult to determine which of the many towns along its coast would make for the perfect destination. After considering Herceg Novi, Budva, Petrovac, Bar and Sutomore, I finally chose the one location that I had trouble finding any information about at all. So, I booked an apartment in the town of Ulcinj, located just 40kms from the border with Albania, in a region of the country that seemed to receive far fewer visitors than the towns farther to the north. Then, upon arrival in Montenegro last week, and with no real knowledge of what to...","July 16th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/a-one-week-beach-vacation-in-ulcinj-montenegro/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
"A Perfect, Affordable Beach Destination – Unawatuna, Sri Lanka","I’m sorry, Sri Lanka. For many years, I chose to ignore you, to shun you, to shrug my shoulders and say “Eh” whenever you were mentioned. After a quick 3-day visit to Colombo back in 2002, I never thought about paying a visit to your shores again. This was despite 30 trips to India, your neighbor to the north, and despite rumors from other travelers that you really were an excellent and affordable beach destination. Why did I treat you so? Honestly, you just didn’t sound that appealing to me. You didn’t seem like the kind of destination I would enjoy or be interested in and so, I never found it justifiable to spend the money for a visit. But today, I sit here and say, “I’m sorry.” Back in January this year, after spending a month in Bali and after a couple of unexpected hiccups with our travel plans,...","March 24th, 2018",https://wanderingearl.com/perfect-affordable-beach-destination-unawatuna-sri-lanka/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel

While I wasn’t able to see everything I wanted on this trip, I did manage to see a decent amount as I traveled from Montenegro to Albania and then to Macedonia. I spent time at the beach, climbed fortresses high abovefairy tale-esque towns, wandered around interesting cities, relaxed at picturesque lakes, hiked through canyons and soaked up the atmosphere of ancient villages, among many other things.

The Uselessness of Getting Upset While Traveling,"About a year and a half ago, I was sitting at an outdoor table in front of a tiny food stall in the small town ofIzamal, Mexico. There was a large group of us and we had all ordered some lunch. After fifteen minutes of waiting, the woman working at the food stall began brining out our food, one plate at a time. The only thing is that what she was bringing us, wasn’t exactly what we had ordered. And before we knew it, our table was full of more chicken salbutes than we could have possibly wanted to eat, yet there wasn’t a taco or panucho or beef salbute in sight, all of which had been asked for.

Living Abroad For Less Than $1000 Per Month,"During a walk around Playa del Carmen yesterday, I happened to pass by a small, colorful building down a narrow side street, a street that I had never been down before. In the front window of this building, hanging from some sort of rotting suction cup hook, was a handwritten sign advertising “Estudios En Renta Por Mes” (Studios for Rent by the Month). And even though I already have a place to stay down here, my curious nature led me inside the doorway where I soon found myself asking the woman behind the desk if I could have a look at her studio apartments.

Snow and ice have been piled high, covering every inch of ground for quite a while now, and the temperature has consistently hovered around the -10 to -22C (14 to -4 F) mark. About ten days ago, after meeting a friend in the city center, I actually had to walk back to the apartment where I’m staying in the middle of a blizzard. The taxis either refused to take me because of the road conditions or they wanted to charge me a ridiculous price and so, I just ended up walking instead.

These travelers often claim to feel as if they are merely a tourist in a zoo when they arrive in such places, where the only option is to stare at locals as if they were on display and enter into interactions that exist only because of tourism.

Qat is a plant that is grown all over Yemen, on what seems to be every square inch of land, whether in the valleys or on the mountainsides, that could be used to grow a plant. When the leaves of the plant are fresh, they are chewed, an activity that leads to a state of increased excitement with the possibility of mild euphoria as a bonus.

Always bring a compass to pinpoint bearings when trails fork or land features obscure. Altimeters also prove handy for gauging progress when following undulating mountain contours.

So when I discovered that I needed to spend a week in Singapore once again, I somewhat unenthusiastically began my search for accommodation. Hostels in Singapore are pricey in comparison to other Southeast Asian countries as one can easily expect to pay $25 Singaporean Dollars for a dorm bed ($19 US) or around $80 S for a private room, which you can bet will not have a private bathroom and will be the size of a phone booth.

My views about a particular city, or even country, have little to do with the tourist attractions that may or may not exist or about the number of chances to take stunning photos that I may have during my stay. Instead, I formulate my opinions based upon my interactions with local people, my wanderings around random, everyday neighborhoods and my keen interest in trying to ‘feel’ a destination as opposed to simply seeing it. And when travel is approached in this manner, it is, quite frankly, difficult not to enjoy every single destination that one visits.

So here we go… India is commonly known as one of the least expensive destinations for travelers, especially for budget travelers. Prices here can often seem shockingly low for anyone who has spent much of their time in North America or Europe, and even for those who have traveled to other regions of the world, India usually seems like an incredible bargain. But just how much of a bargain is it? For those of you on the tightest of budgets, you could survive here in India with a daily spending limit of $15 USD per day. This would enable you to stay in low-end budget hotels, to eat simple meals at local eateries and to utilize local...","December 3rd, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/how-much-it-costs-to-travel-in-india/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
How I Find Coworking Spaces Around the World,"Every week I work. It’s not just travel. Without work, there would be no travel. If I need to work40 hours per week, or more, so be it. The reward is being able to spend my free time on all kinds of adventures around the world that I never dreamed I would be able to experience. As my life takes me from place to place though, getting into a good work routine is still a challenge I deal with constantly. Staying motivated amidst the allure of sleepy mornings, fun activities, hanging out with new people and just walking around a new destination is not easy. Then comes the challenge of where to work. I need to find coworking spaces and good cafes everywhere I go so that I have a place to actually sit down and get things done. — Some days my work involves answering hundreds of emails that...","July 26th, 2020",https://wanderingearl.com/coworking-spaces-around-the-world/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Maldives on a Budget: Step by Step Guide,"You walk off the plane, proceed through immigration, grab your bag from the luggage carousel (or not, if you travel really light) and walk through the customs inspection. And there you stand, in the open-air arrivals terminal of the Male International Airport. Welcome to the Maldives on a budget! While you might not exactly find a crowd of budget travelers hanging around the airport, or independent travelers either, you’d be mistaken if you think that these islands are only for the wealthy or those who are ready to splurge big time. The truth is that you really can visit the Maldives on a budget. Here’s how, step by step:[x_gap size=”2.313em”] Fares from the Middle East (ie. Doha and Dubai), India (Cochin) and SE Asia (ie. Kuala Lumpur and Singapore) are as low as $200 USD roundtrip to Male, the main city and location of the main airport in the Maldives....","December 12th, 2016",https://wanderingearl.com/maldives-on-a-budget-step-by-step-guide/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
How Safe Is Traveling To Iraq?,"Without even asking anyone, I’m quite certain that the reason Iraq doesn’t end up on many traveler’s itineraries is because of a strong sense of fear that bodily harm or even death is a very real possibility for any foreign visitor to this region. However, traveling has taught me to expect the unexpected and so I figured that the best way to assess the safety situation in Iraq, was to venture there myself. And far from visiting such cities as Baghdad and Tikrit, which are both extremely dangerous, I instead headed to the semi-autonomous region known as Kurdistan. Of course, Kurdistan itself suffers from continued conflict with Turkey to the north and Iran to the east as well as having to fiercely protect it’s borders from the highly unstable regions of Iraq to the south. As a result, traveling to this part of the country is not exactly an automatic...","December 13th, 2010",https://wanderingearl.com/how-safe-is-traveling-to-iraq/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
I’m Going On Vacation,"As of this very moment, I’m taking a break. It won’t be a terribly long break, maybe 7 or 10 days at most, but during this period of time I will not be putting any posts up on the site and I’ll be responding to emails at a much slower pace than normal. This will actually be the first break I’ve really taken since this blog became a major part of my life. Barely a day goes by without me being on the internet, working long hours to take care of everything that needs to be taken care of with this blog. And surely everyone deserves a vacation every now and then, even bloggers, right? Just a few hours ago I arrived in Belgrade after taking the overnight train (pictured above) from Bucharest to Timisoara, Romania, followed by a delayed shuttle bus ride into Serbia. Tomorrow I shall arrive in...","July 5th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/im-going-on-vacation/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
Santa Is My Ho-Ho-Homeboy & Other XShot Photos From This Week,"What a week. From Florida to Houston, back to Florida and up to New York City I went. And then I flew to India, where I am right now, sitting in my hotel room in Delhi, still in a state of disbelief about being back in this incredible country. And in between all of the flying over the last seven days, in between myvisa run to Houstonand trying to get as much work done as possible, and in between the hundreds upon hundreds of emails, I somehow still managed to accomplish everything I set out to accomplish during my quick visit back to the US. Then, in a flash, that visit was over and I found myself walking out the door of the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, where, immediately upon arrival in the city center, I ran around in such awe that you would have thought it was...","October 29th, 2012",https://wanderingearl.com/santa-is-my-ho-ho-homeboy-other-xshot-photos/,Derek,wanderingearl.com,Travel
