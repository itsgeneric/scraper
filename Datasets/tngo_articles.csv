LEBANESE REVOLUTION: a Worldwide Struggle for Justice and Equality 🇱🇧,"by Aurora Ceccotti
The WhatsApp tax that initiated what Al-Jazeera defines as a #revolution is just the tip of the iceberg. After years of dereliction of duty by the government and economic mismanagement, Lebanese people are demonstrating side by side, regardless cultural or religious differences, with common goals, such as, but not limited to an administration free of #corruption and the #resignation of Lebanese officials.
The support for Lebanon comes from all over the world, as many Lebanese living in other countries are showing support to their fellow citizens. This revolution shows how people can overcome differences and distance when united by the same purpose of achievement of #justice and #equality.
“On one side I’m extremely proud of what’s going on in Lebanon and I’m happy I have the chance to raise awareness about the current situation here in London; on the other hand, it’s hard not to be in my country in such an important historic event, I wish I could be there and provide a greater contribution to the protest”, says Layla, a Lebanese student living in London.
– How will the government respond to the demonstrators’ request?
– Does the revolution represent a step towards an improved form of democracy?

"THE 9th OF NOVEMBER: one date, multiple meanings for Germany’s history","by Marta Moretti
Not only the anniversary of the end of a 40 years separation, but also the 1938’s Night of broken glass echoing the progrom against Jewish carried out by Nazism.
A red rose was laid down by chancellor Angela Merkel on the Wall memorial at Bernauer Straße, urging European leader sto “stand up for democracy and freedom, for human rights and tolerance”.
Although former wall anniversaries were always celebrated with many events, nothing was organized today to bring all Berliners together.
Among the citizens of Berlin, 87% report to be relieved that the city is no longer divided, but 42% feel that the reunification process happened too quickly, a survey of the Berliner Zeitung newspaper shows.
• After 30 years, is the new unified Germany a simple fusion of the two halves, or simply a takeover by the West?• Is Germans’ identity suffering from the burden of the past?

ITALY & FASCISM: the Complicity of infinite Political Bargaining 🇮🇹,"by Milena Di Nenno
98 were the abstentions in the Italian Parliament for the vote on the motion to establish a commission against hate, racism, and antisemitism.
200 is the average antisemitic and hateful messages that who proposed this commission receives daily.
2 are the body guards who have been assigned to protect this person.
She is Liliana Segre, an Italian 89-year-old senator for life and survivor of the Holocaust. She was deported to Auschwitz in 1943, at the age of 13, not because she was Italian, but because she was Jewish.
From the outside, these numbers might be only partially significant, yet they summarize the last 75 years of Italian history. As soon as the Italian people realized the cruel betrayal of the Italian Jews, who even supported the Fascist regime at the beginning, antisemitisim seemed to disappear from discussions. However, there is a sentiment that was kept alive underneath the surface; it is the “Mussolini ha fatto anche cose buone” – Mussolini did also good things – belief, that some Italians continue to advocate for. Were the good things more relevant than the bad things? Were these enough to forget about all the remaining cruelties?
Unfortunately, the answer seems to be yes. Otherwise, we would not be in this situation in which some question the legitimacy of Liliana Segre as senator for life. “What did she do to get a senator salary financed by the Italians?”- one of the many hate messages she received spells. She was a witness of the horrifying violation of human rights carried out by the Fascist regime, but still this is probably not as good as Mussolini’s “cose buone.”
All of this is likely to be the result of Italian political class’s weakness, or unwillingness. It is the result of continuous political bargaining that usually is left with no solution and then forgotten, in the same way Fascist cruelty seems to have been.
We have evidence of it even for what concerns the most obvious issue after the end of WWII: the damnatio memoriae of Fascism was never put into place.
Italian far-right movements will continue to consider themselves legitimized, if this is the approach of the political cast.
Those 98 abstentions are not just another one of the numerous failures of Italian politicians to reach agreements. These abstentions symbolize a strong indifference, driven by some sort of denialism, towards problems that belong to the past, but are not past.
•  To what extend is second-hand guilt a strong emotion in contemporary societies?
•  How important is second-hand guilt for the political decision-making process?
•  Would a damnatio memoriaeof Fascism be necessary?

The “Julian Assange” Dilemma: criminal or champion of justice?,"by Aurora Ceccotti
On Tuesday, November 18th, the Assange rape investigation was dropped.
The co-founder of Wikileaks, however, still has to face 18 charges from the USA. He is, for instance, accused to have leaked thousands of classified documents and having broken into a Pentagon computer.
The figure of Assange is incredibly controversial: on one hand, it may be argued that the charges he has to respond to are not legitimate as he was simply providing an alternative source of information, which is one of the essential features a democracy needs to have to be defined as such. On the other hand, it could be claimed that he acted against the law, meaning that he has to respond to rightful accusations.

#IranProtest – una nuova onda verde in Iran?,"by Norberto Cristofori
Dal 16 Novembre l’Iran è isolato dal mondo. Il governo guidato da Rouhani ha disattivato la rete internet in tutto il Paese. Il motivo principale è l’aumento e lo spargersi in più di 60 città di numerose proteste contro l’aumento del 300% del prezzo della benzina.
Qualche giorno fa l’Iran aveva annunciato il ritrovamento di un enorme nuovo giacimento di petrolio che avrebbe aumentato la produzione e le riserve di miliardi di barili.
Ma le cattive acque diplomatiche con gli Stati Uniti e il ritorno delle sanzioni hanno riaperto una grave crisi economica nel Paese.
Per questo molti iraniani sono scesi in piazza da Teheran a Shirazaffrontando un duro e sanguinoso scontro con l’esercito e la polizia.
Le notizie che arrivano da un Paese senza contatti con l’esterno sono di diversi morti e decine di feriti.
Le protese non si sono fermate neanche davanti alle parole dell’Ayatollah Alì Khamenei, la guida spirituale del paese, che ha difeso la decisione del governo, intervenendo direttamente con una sua dichiarazione:
«Azioni di sabotaggio vengono messe in atto da teppisti sostenuti da potenze straniere, non dal nostro popolo. La controrivoluzione e i nemici dell’Iran hanno sempre sostenuto il sabotaggio e la violazione della sicurezza del nostro paese. Io non sono un esperto, ma quando tre istituzioni prendono una decisione, io la appoggio.»

Israele torna alla stagione degli attacchi mirati,"By Vittoria Corrado
Una nuova crisi si è aperta in questi giorni fra Israele e gli estremisti palestinesi sulla striscia di Gaza. Israele ritorna a dar prova della sua elaborata strategia militare del target killing, avendo colpito con successo due importanti membri del Jihad Islamico, ritenuti altamente pericolosi per la sicurezza israeliana.Il governo israeliano ha ribadito che non vuole l’escalation militare ma ha de facto rimesso sul tavolo delle possibilità una nuova stagione di sangue. La sola cosa certa è che a Gaza esplode una nuova ondata di odio che farà presto a produrre i suoi effetti.

El Auge del Nacionalismo en Europa: el Caso de España y la Crisis Catalana,"by Beatriz Lasheras Mas
El nacionalismo en Europa se ha disparado en los últimos años junto con el auge de los partidos de extrema derecha.
En países como Francia o Italia, conRassemblement Nationalde Marine Le Pen o laLegade Matteo Salvini, respectivamente, se ha exacerbado un sentimiento nacionalista que se opone al fenómeno de la globalización y a la desdibujación de fronteras que se produjo con la integración europea. En España, sin embargo, el auge del nacionalismo ha llegado tarde. Es ahora cuando un partido hermano a sus homólogos europeos ha obtenido representación parlamentaria a nivel nacional.
Vox, liderado por Santiago Abascal, obtuvo 24 diputados en las elecciones de abril de 2019, Y, en menos de seis meses con la repetición electoral, ha mejorado su resultado hasta los 52 parlamentarios que consiguió en los comicios de noviembre (El parlamento español está formado por un total de 350 escaños). Mientras en Europa, el principal factor que ha catapultado a este tipo de partidos ha sido el miedo a la inmigración, en España, aunque también ha sido un motor importante, el principal factor ha sido otro: lacrisis en Cataluña.
La amenaza de ruptura de la unidad territorial ha motivado un sentimiento patriótico que en España llevaba décadas dormido. Es importante destacar que cuando la mayoría de países europeos contaba con una democracia, la sociedad española estaba sumida en una dictadura. La represión y la falta de libertad de expresión fueron el pan de cada día para los españoles durante casi cuarenta años (1939-1975). Con la muerte del dictador Francisco Franco, llegó la democracia y el país se abrió rapidamente dando cabida a un Estado formado por 17 comunidades autónomas con una amplia capacidad para autolegislarse.
Históricamente, dos regiones de España han reivindicado su propia nacionalidad:Cataluña y País Vasco. Ambas con una gran capacidad de autonomía frente al Estado central. La era del terrorismo de ETA, que reivindicaba la independencia de la región vasca, terminó con el cese definitivo de la banda en marzo de 2018. El nacionalismo catalán que llevaba años derivado a un segundo plano ha vuelto a tomar protagonismo en la segunda década del siglo XXI. Un movimiento definido por su carácter pacifista que, tras la publicación de una sentencia que condenaba a varios líderes catalanes, ya ha protagonizado protestas violentas.
Todo esto pone de manifiesto el enorme reto al que se enfrenta el conjunto de España para abordar el conflicto de manera democrática y, sobre todo, pacífica. Porque al contrario que en el resto de Europa, en España el auge del nacionalismo no es solo una cuestión a nivel nacional sino también regional.

Febbre Sudamericana,"by Norberto Cristofori
Il Sudamerica dopo anni di effettiva stabilità politica ed economica è esploso.
Ecuador, Perù, Cile, Argentina, Colombia e Bolivia sono in rivolta. I motivi sono vari, si parla di una sempre più elevata corruzione, ad una classe politica non all’altezza, all’aumento della povertà, crisi economica e brogli elettorali.
L’ultimo caso registrato è quello dellaBolivia. Un Paese governato da 14 anni da Evo Morales, un ex sindacalista dei coltivatori di coca, che ha dovuto dimettersi dopo le accuse di brogli elettorali e fuggire in Messico.
InEcuadoril presidente Lenin Moreno ad inizio ottobre aveva deciso di eliminare i sussidi ai carburanti in accordo con il FMI. La capitale Quito è stata teatro di una violenta manifestazione che ha costretto il governo a fuggire, decretando il coprifuoco e lo stato d’emergenza.
InPerùla situazione che si vive è tra due fazioni: quella dell’ex presidente Fujimori, in carcere per corruzione, e il governo guidato da Martin Vizcarra, che ha sciolto il Congresso e indetto elezioni per il 26 Gennaio. Ad oggi la polizia e i militari controllano il centro di Lima dove si registrano continue proteste e manifestazioni.
IlCiledoveva essere il Paese più sicuro in Sudamerica. Ma l’aumento di 4 centesimi sulle tariffe della metro a Santiago ha innestato una protesta che si è diffusa in tutto il Paese. Il malcontento per la situazione economica sempre più difficile degli ultimi anni covava in buona parte della popolazione e la rabbia ha provocato saccheggi e violenze. Il presidente Sebastián Piñera per riprendere il controllo del Cile ha chiesto il supporto dei militari portando il Paese indietro ai tempi di Pinochet.
L’Argentinaè tornata in mano ai peronisti con la vittoria netta all’elezioni di Alberto Fernandez. La crisi economica ha riportato il Paese ancora una volta al default. Il crollo del peso, l’inflazione dilagante, disoccupazione e povertà al 35% saranno i più grossi problemi che dovrà affrontare il nuovo governo in aggiunta ad un nuovo accordo con il FMI.
LaColombiavive ormai da anni un continuo conflitto interno. Le Farc sono ancora oggi un problema nel panorama politico del Paese, anche dopo l’accordo di pace nel 2016 del presidente Juan Manuel Santos. Le elezioni amministrative tenutesi il 27 ottobre hanno indebolito l’attuale governo conservatore, soprattutto per la vittoria della leader dei Verdi Claudia Lopez, nuova sindaca di Bogotà e probabile sfidante alle prossime elezioni presidenziali.
Il malcontento si è diffuso in tutto il Sudamerica come una febbre stagionale e difficilmente passerà presto.

La Grande Illusione del Miracolo Cileno,"by Vittoria Corrado
In queste settimane i milioni di manifestanti nelle strade di Santiago, Valparaíso e Concepción, hanno operato una rottura nella narrativa sul Cile come paese virtuoso della regione. I militari sono tornati nelle strade e con loro la replica dell’antico copione latinoamericano di repressione dura del dissenso e di personificazione del popolo come nemico pubblico.
A protestare sono soprattutto giovani, studenti e gente comune. Chiedono giustizia sociale, diritti fattuali, servizi di base efficienti. Il protagonista della rivolta è quindi il popolo cileno, il grande escluso dai dividendi del benessere economico. Il Cile appare così nella sua nuda veste di paese profondamente ingiusto e disuguale, dove il processo di privatizzazione dei settori nevralgici della sua economia ha coinvolto persino l’accesso all’acqua potabile.

GDP & POLITICS: Are We Measuring Actual Progress?,"During the Second World War, the British economistJohn Maynard Keynesdeveloped the modern definition of Gross Domestic Product, as:
«the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country during one year.»
With this index, Keynes aimed at measuring and assessing Britain’s capacity for mobilization and conflict.
The fact that the GDP has become a worldwide measurement of economic well-being is contingent to the fact that the UK Treasury (which, thanks to Keynes, had already implemented the use of the GDP for civil purposes) provided most of the preparatory paperwork for the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, where the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) were established. As a consequence, the two financial institutions kept on using theGross Domestic Product as a measure of economic growthfor the following 70 years and states with them.
Nevertheless, economists have warned us on several occasions that the GDP is anextremely specialized tool. It focuses on economicquantity, rather than on economicqualityorwelfare(or more precisely, it is supposed to measure well-being as a function of GDP/capita). Moreover, its emphasis on quantity has been raising concerns that GDP could even encourage the depletion of social and natural capital, to the detriment of the quality of life of future generations.
Finally, GDP excludes from its calculations fundamental determinants of welfare, such as the quality of the environment, criminal activity, public infrastructure, and even income inequality.
“It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”
As the above picture clearly shows, the case of Italy presents that income inequality has been increasing from 1975 to 2015, year when the top 10% of the population earned the same share as the bottom 50%, regardless of a steady and consistent growth of the national GDP/capita throughout the period.
The question then arises:how would economic policies change if we had a more holistic idea of well-being and growth?
Do we consider progress as the “result of living off the interest of community capital, or just of spending it down”? (Costanza et al. 2009)
TheIndexofSustainable Economic Welfare(ISEW), then renamed Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), provides a creative solution to GDP’s deficiencies. Its measurements take the GDP as a baseline and make additions for the value of housework, voluntary services, durable goods and public infrastructure while detracting the cost of environmental degradation, crime, income inequality and depletion of natural capital. If we considered ISEW/capita as a measure of growth and welfare, the global panorama of socio-political state performance would greatly vary.
As the data shown above indicate, countries that have engaged in welfarist policies and promoting environmental sustainability would be performing extremely well (e.g. Sweden), whereas countries that did not tackle income inequality nor invested substantially in public infrastructure would be penalized (e.g. Italy). Finally, countries, such as the United States, that instead have been neglecting environmental standards, experiencing rising income inequality, privatizing public services and promoting natural capital depletion would result in having a lower economic welfare than they had in the 1950s.

MIDDLE EAST: The Scream For Justice,"The wave of protests that has been shaking the Middle East recently isn’t just a simple call for reforms, nor a contagious will for revolution.
The Middle East has been home towars, corruption and foreign interestespecially in these last years: ISIS, internal issues and international intervention, sanctions and lack of resources due to incapable administration of the government. This pays off, with revolts and death.
However, therevoltsthat have been rising in the Middle East these last months – Sudan, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran – have been peaceful and some even punctually joyful, although everyone was extremely aware of the risks, as police and army brutality aren’t something new in the Middle East and cannot be compared to that of the West.
Theblatant corruptionthat hardens the day-to-day life of citizens has arrived to critical points, especially due to the price of oil, health-care, electricity and other basic comforts. Conscious of how politics works in Middle Eastern countries, the population can resist until a certain point, and, seeing that theArab Springdid only bring spring for some and even for just a short period of time, the work is not done for those who want to lead normal, stable lives.
There is one common factor in the Middle Eastern revolutions:it is for the well-being of all citizens, regardless of ethnicity or affiliation, and women have been very present in the protests.
Al-Tahrir square, which would translate to “Liberation Square” in Arabic, is the main square in many capitals in the Middle East, and now they’re holding their name proudly more than ever

Macron Vs Merkel: To NATO or Not To NATO,"by Aurora Ceccotti & Milena Di Nenno
On November 7th, Macron released the interview which led to a strong disequilibrium within the European Union and significantly challenged the relations between France and Germany.
He declared to the Economist that “NATO is becoming brain dead” heavily criticizing Turkey’s operation in Syria and suggesting the need for a European military alliance completely detached from NATO.
This declaration led to several implications, includingErdogan’s response, saying that “Macronis in a state of ‘brain death’” and the exacerbation of tensions with Angela Merkel. In contrast, she in fact considers NATO as “cornerstone of our security” (BBC, 2019).
Furthermore, the German chancellor stated, referring to Macron: “I’m tired of picking up the pieces. Over and over, I have to glue together the cups you have broken so that we can then sit down and have a cup of tea together” (Erlanger, 2019). This clash reflects the incompatibility of two politicians with contrasting approaches: theconservativeanddiplomaticpolitics of Merkel and thedisruptive,impatientattitude of Macron.
This declaration was the source of instability that could easily have been avoided. However, it could be argued that Macron’s approach is themost efficient method to challenge the status quoandstart the birthing process of a new European alliance completely independent from the USA. The disruption of collaboration with NATO could, however, seem like a challenge to the US, thus eventually leading to military tensions.

A Dangerous Intersectionality,"by Marta Moretti
Gun Laws in the US: do they help protect African Americans or do they actually make them more vulnerable to racism and police brutality?A vicious cycle, a black hole. Is the intersection of guns and race more obvious, or more dangerous?
Charles E Cobb Jr – a journalist, professor, and former activist with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee – notes this by looking at how “the tradition of armed self-defense in Afro-American historycannot be disconnected from the successes of what today is called the nonviolent civil rights movement.”
Historically, black people’s access to guns was key to the success of theBlack Freedom Movement– whose main target was the government itself. American history is a book also written with the blood of black families killed by white people who found themselves protected by a government believing in the supremacy of its white citizens.
Hence, constitutionally protected access to firearms: the best protection black people could look for. Even the National Rifle Association, the strongest and most aggressively vocal lobby in the US, is silent when black people are killed for legally possessing firearms, or toys.
From weapons ownership to healthcare: black people’s agency is still perceived as a threat, or as “other”.
This is why many black people feel the need to protect themselves from the government itself. We have also to remember that this is the same government refusing to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to even study the issue of gun violence.
The relationship between communities and their police force will never improve as long as the police will keep to see and treat the community as an “other”. A public disarmament could result in a de-escalation of the police force brutality cases.

The End of the Two-Party System in Spain 🇪🇸,"by Beatriz Lasheras Mas
Four national elections in less than four years.
The end of bipartisanship in Spain has revealed the inability of old and new parties to form a covenant government.
After Franco’s dictatorship (1939-1975), two main parties,Partido Popular (PP)– right wing- andPartido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE)–left wing, have been switching the power following the British model (Conservative Party/Labour Party).
However, the global economic crisis of 2008, that had hit Spain especially hard, has changed the Spanish political system. New political parties emerged and right and left wings have been fragmented.
Three new partieshave taken centre stage in the political field with a significant number of votes: Ciudadanos (center-right), Unidas Podemos (left) and Vox (extreme right). Also, for the first time in the history of Spanish democracy,there was a motion of censure against the former premier Mariano Rajoy.
With these new factors and actors,the previous governance model has been damaged. Ahead of a fractured parliament in which no party is able to govern by itself, the solution seems to be to reach agreements between the political forces, something that has already been working for years in the local parliaments, but which is finding more difficulties at national level.
In the Spanish political system, in order to invest a prime minister, the king calls a candidate to try to form a government (usually the most voted one). This candidate should find enough support and go into an investiture. In the first round, it is necessary to count with the majority (176 deputies out of 350) and in the second round to have more ‘yes’ than ‘no’. If the candidate called by the king is not able to get enough supports, the king can call another candidate or dissolve the parliament and convocated new elections.
In 2015, Spain experienced general elections. PP won with 123 deputes but it was not able to form a stable government and in 2016 the country was called to vote again. This time, the main right-wing party managed to form a government. However, two years later a huge scandal of corruption came out and amotion of censure, under the leadership of Pedro Sánchez,removed Mariano Rajoy and gave the power to the opposition leadership.
The new prime minister was not able to present a stable government, his party being in minority, and hence was forced to call for elections again in 2019. The vote has been held in April and PSOE won with 123 deputes. After months of negotiations, the main leftist party was not able to create a coalition government that could reach the support of the majority. In this last phase, Spain was once again called to elections. The last elections have taken place this November.
PSOE won again, but it lost two seats and the right-wing forces resulted to have strengthened their position. After the results, fearful of the rising influence of their opposition, PSOE and Unidas Podemos reached an agreement to govern together within 24 hours. For the first time in the history of Spanish democracy,a coalition government is being created. Now, we should wait and see if these two parties are able to get enough supports to materialize this alliance.It could be the beginning of a relevant change in the Spanish political system.

Il Vangelo secondo Cucchi: la parabola della Giustizia Selettiva Italiana,"È un placido mercoledì sera, quello del 14 ottobre 2009, quando il geometra romano Stefano Cucchi viene dichiarato in stato di fermo, perquisito, trovato con più di 20 grammi di stupefacenti e condotto alla stazione Appia di Roma in custodia cautelare.
Durante la prima udienza del 15 ottobre 2019, Cucchi già presenta evidenti ematomi da percosse ma nega di essere stato picchiato e rifiuta il ricovero ospedaliero. Dopo una settimana, il giovane si spegne all’età di 31 anni nel reparto detenuti dell’Ospedale Sandro Pertini, dove era stato ricoveratonolensa causa delle sue aggravate condizioni mediche.
Dal 15 novembre 2009 ad oggi, la famiglia Cucchi e la Procura di Roma hanno sostenuto l’accusa di omicidio colposo/preterintenzionale e abuso d’ufficio per i carabinieri arrestanti e le guardie penitenziarie della stazione Appia, richiedendo invece indagini contro i medici ed infermieri del Pertini per falso ideologico e abbandono di infermo.
Iprimi processi (2009-2014)portano all’assoluzione di tutti gli imputati per “mancanza di prove,” a quanto recita la sentenza della Corte d’Appello del 31 ottobre 2014. La possibilità di sussistenza di reato tuttavia spinge la medesima corte a richiedere nuove indagini sul caso.
L’inchiesta Cucchi-bisculminerànel 2016con l’assoluzione dei sei medici del Pertini che si occuparono del geometra, il quale si sostiene sia deceduto per inanizione (deperimento organico indotto da malnutrizione). Ed è solo conl’inchiesta Cucchi-tere le rispettivesentenze della Corte d’Assise di Roma e della Corte d’Assise d’Appello, le quali arrivano il15 novembre 2019(a dieci anni esatti dal primo processo), che si respira un’aria di chiusura.
Alessio Di Bernardo e Raffaele D’Alessandro sono i nomi dei carabinieri che vengono condannati a 12 anni per omicidio preterintenzionale, con i colleghi Tedesco e Mandolini ai quali viene contestato il reato di falso con una condanna di rispettivamente 2 anni e 6 mesi per il primo e 3 anni ed 8 mesi per il secondo. 4 assoluzioni ed 1 assoluzione invece per i medici del Pertini.
La battaglia per la verità capitanata da Ilaria Cucchi, sorella di Stefano, contro le pressioni di alcuni vertici dell’Arma dei Carabinieri ed esponenti politici ha condotto adotto processiepiù di dieci anni di diatriba giudiziariacon gli imputati.
Quella della famiglia Cucchi è una parabola che riscopre ledebolezze intrinsechedi un sistema giudiziario ancora troppo esposto alle pressioni politiche, un sistema vittima di omertà all’interno dell’esecutivo Italiano che già in passato ha rallentato ed ostacolato il corso della giustizia in casi di brutalità degli organi della polizia contro cittadini (vedasi il caso Aldrovandi, i cui processi sono durati dal 2006 al 2011).
Quella della famiglia Cucchi è una parabola diingiustizia, ingiustizia che ha arbitrariamente portato via una vita ad opera dell’organo che è volto a preservarla. Ed ingiustizia che vede pagare 30 anni chi ne ha sottratti molti di più.
Infine quella dell’omicidio Cucchi è anche una parabola disperanza, speranza negli individui come il carabiniere Tedesco che, attraverso le loro testimonianze chiave, hanno reagito all’ingiustizia sistematizzata e taciuta per anni e hanno reso possibile la condanna di chi abusò dei poteri delegatigli dallo Stato.

Sudan’s Awakening,"Since Sudan got free from Al-Bashir’s clutches last April, lots of things have changed, very fast.
The famous Sudanese sit-in in front of the military headquarters in Khartoum would mark a complete different revolt, this time, it seems, with a happy end.
Therevolution that began in mid December 2018has had a high price for the Sudanese, but they fought for their rights regardless, after 30 years of dictatorship and repression. Women and children took the streets together with men, and they also died for the revolution that made their country becomethe new hope of the area today.
After the armed forces removed the dictator from power in April 11, theTransitional Military Councilreplaced Al-Bashir and was responsible for assessing the country’s issues, from the economic crisis and austerity to the general disgust for the decades long regime.
However, things were not safe there. On the 3rd of lJune, the military and members of the Janjaweed militia performed what became the Khartoum massacre, in which more than 100 peaceful protestors perished. That is not new to Khartoum, which has seen rivers of blood when protesting against the government in the past. The new prime minister – an economist – is aiming to prosecute those individuals that were identified as having taken part in the violent massacre in June, where rape and murder were extremely widespread, regardless of the victims’ gender.
This past July, the country began legally the transition towards democracy, the military gradually leaving its power to civilian individuals, like the current prime minister Abdallah Hamdok.
It has been 71 years that Sudan hadn’t seen anything remotely close to democracy, as its last parliamentary elections were in 1948. Omar Al-Bashir’s pending trial and an economic rescue plan are to be served in the coming months, together with measures to revert the austerity plan that has been so heavy on citizens and their basic needs.
On 29 November 2019, theNational Congress Party– Al- Bashir’s Islamist party – formally dissolved, and the “Public Order Law” – common in many countries where Islamist parties have power to apply Shari’a-based laws targeting mainly women – has been abolished as unconstitutional.
In spite of all the carnage on its back, Sudan is now open for tourists to visit, visas being easier to obtain for international tourists. In their aim of opening up the country and the economy, Sudan has been receiving foreign aid (mainly from Qatar, as well as support from Saudi Arabia and the Emirates) in order to get its economy back to where it should be, as it has been suffering from extreme inflation and corruption.
Nonetheless, given that the Middle East has seen power conflicts all around it, we should ask ourselves until what point the aid sent and the interest shown in Sudan’s benefit is really genuine and without interest.
Elections are expected for 2022, and from now until then,the new government should begin the process towards democracy, an austerity-free economy and uplifting measures to recover the country from all the pain and hardship it has endured in these last three decades: not only Khartoum and the most important cities, but also the more neglected areas, generally located in the periphery.
Given that elections will be two years from now, the council agreed on shifting power – always with civilians keeping an eye to avoid coups d’état – between a military member and a civilian one, according to the plan stated until a population-based government is finally achieved after elections.
The relation with South Sudan, which gained independence in 2011 from Sudan – South Sudan being rich in oil, which devastated Sudan’s economy – will also be part of politics from now on, aiming to restore fruitful relations.
It is up to the United States, however, to decide whether to lift up Sudan from the list of sponsor of terrorism, as it would greatly help Sudan and its economy, now that the path to democracy is being shaped.

"En Lesbos, la Unión Europea dio la espalda al principio de humanidad","By Vittoria Corrado
Los dos hotspots de Lesbos – el de Moria y el de Kara Tepe – se han convertido a lo largo de los años en el símbolo del fracaso de la política europea de inmigración.
Sólo en Moira – un campo profugós planificado para albergar a 3.000 personas – viven 13.000 inmigrantes en una espera cruel e interminable del permiso de salida.
La situación está colapsando: la mayoría de ellos viven en carpas al aire libre, sin los servicios medicos necesarios y la cuestión de los espacios limitados facilita la explosión de episodios violentos.
Grecia y Turquía -los principales actores políticos implicados- están totalmente desinteresados en mejorar la situación dado que hasta que los inmigrantes lleguen a Lesbos, también les seguirán llegando los financiamentos de la Unión Europea.
Además no cabe duda que los inmigrantes son un recurso estrategico, un pretexto negociable con una fuerza politicasin fin.Erdogan lo sabía bien cuando, después de su ataque al noreste de Siria, jugó la carta del chantaje a los inmigrantes.
Todos los países de la Unión Europea deben recordarse de los propros compromisos debidos al status de país miembro.Es legítimo discutir la “forma” de cumplirlos, en cambio es indiscutible el principio de acogida que compone y define la identidad europea.

La emergencia climática a debate en Madrid: Cumbre Mundial del Clima COP25,"Por Beatriz Lasheras Mas
La capital de España reúne a más de 20.000 representantes para afrontar un reto global: la crisis climática.
Lavigésimo quinta Cumbre Mundial del Clima, que se celebra del 2 al 13 de diciembre, debía haberse materializado en Chile, pero las protestas contra el gobierno de Sebastián Piñera estuvieron a punto de cancelar este encuentro anual.
En este contexto, España ofreció Madrid como alternativa y en tres semanas ha organizado una Cumbre que debería ser de crucial importancia. Durante estos diez días, se debe encontrar la forma degarantizar la implantación total del Acuerdo de París, el primer pacto mundial para hacer frente al cambio climático.
El Acuerdo de París, que se firmó en 2015 y lleva activo parcialmente desde noviembre de 2016, tiene como principal objetivolimitar el calentamiento global a 1,5 grados,un compromiso que por la escasez de actuaciones suena utópico.
La acción humana lleva décadas desprendiendo más emisiones de las que el propio planeta es capaz de absorber y estamos pagando la factura. Las medidas llegan tarde y parecen insuficientes. La única solución a esta crisis global pasa por un compromiso real de los principales países emisores, entre los que se encuentra EEUU – liderado por un presidente que ni siquiera acepta la existencia del problema.
El declive medioambiental exige respuestas eficacesde todos los estrados de la sociedad. El primer paso esreconocer que existe un grave deterioro del medioambienteque afecta a todos; el segundo, escrear pequeños hábitos ecológicosen los que hacerse cotidianos, pueden parecer insignificantes, pero todo suma; por último, esnecesario premiar las actividades respetuosas con el medioambiente y castigar, e incluso prohibir, aquellas acciones negativas para el planeta, aunque siempre teniendo en cuenta los recursos de cada país.
Aunque, hoy en día ya es tarde para frenar las consecuencias de la cambio climática es importante tratar de contenerlas y propulsar una transición hacia una producción más limpia y respetuosa que acabe paliando la situación con el paso de los años. Desde pequeñas acciones diarias hasta grandes acuerdos mundiales,luchar contra la emergencia climática está en manos de todos.

Pensacola Shooting: Hatred or Terrorism?,"by Aurora Ceccotti
On the 6th of December, a deadly shooting took place in Pensacola, Florida. In the military base, the Saudi gunman Mohammed Al-Shamrani killed 3 people before being shot dead.
The Pensacola military base hosts several Saudi soldiers; in general, the US counts 16% of Saudi training soldiers in military schools.
Al-Shamrnani, a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force, was quoted by the SITE Intelligence group as saying to be“against evil and America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil. I hate you because every day you [are] supporting, funding and committing crimes not only against Muslims but also humanity,”.
This event represents a dichotomy between the close business relationship Saudi Arabia and the US have and events that make this cooperation dubious,  such as but not limited to the Khashoggi murder and the Saudi military offensive in Yemen (BBC, 2019).
Donald Trump tweeted his condolences for the victims and mentioned a call with King King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,  who allegedly said that “this person in no way, shape, or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people” (Aljazeera, 2019).

CRISI RUSSO-UCRAINA: Il vertice di Parigi riattiva il processo di pace nel Donbass,"A cura di Vittoria Corrado
Dal 2014 nel Donbass si è assistito all’auto-costituzione – con l’aiuto di Mosca – di due repubbliche indipendentiste filo russe: quella di Donetsk e di Lugansk.
Ma a differenza di quanto accaduto in Crimea, Kiev ha mantenuto la presenza militare nell’area, non abbandonando mai il fronte.  Il risultato sono stati gli ultimi 5 anni di conflitto armato fra le milizie separatiste e l’esercito ucraino.
Gli accordi di Minsk del 2015 – sul cessate il fuoco nell’area e la pacificazione del Donbass – si sono rivelati esser lettera morta. E la guerra, ad oggi, ha prodotto un bilancio di circa 13mila morti, più di due milioni di sfollati e migliaia di feriti.
Questo 9 dicembre a Parigi, si sono incontrati per la prima volta dall’inizio del conflitto ipresidenti Volodymyr Zelenskyj e Vladimir Putin. Con la mediazione di Angela Merkel e Emmanuel Macron, l’incontro ha segnato la ripresa del processo di disgelo.
Durante il vertice di Parigi è stato infatti concordatoun piano per la fine delle ostilità, il quale prevede come prima mossa la completa attuazione del cessate il fuoco e il rafforzamento delle misure di tregua.
La strada verso la pace appare tuttavia ancora lunga e tortuosa. Basti pensare che in questa partita si scontrano due volontà inconciliabili: quella di Putin di ottenere uno statuto speciale per il Donbass – pertanto una modifica della costituzione ucraina – e quella di Zelensky del pieno recupero della sovranità sulla regione orientale.
La possibilità che il processo iniziato cada in una situazione di stallo rimane pertanto alta. Ciononostante, a supporto dell’iniziativa di pace permane l’interesse strategico mutuale a mantenere in vita l’accordo sul transito di gas russo per il territorio ucraino.

"IRAQ & IRAN: one step further for the former, one more threat for the latter 🇮🇶 🇮🇷","Iraq’s president resigned amid heavy protests against corruption and the whole government: this may seem, for most all over the world, like a much expected victory. It is not. Iraq’s problems have not finished yet.
History seems to repeat itself: revolution, corrupt leader, Iran’s hands hiding in the darkness, and American intervention. It is indeed worthy of blame that Iran has a visible hand in Iraq, may it be religiously or with the Iraqi Shia militias it backs, but what should raise the alarm is that the United States’ interest in “helping” Iraq is just to control Iran. The pattern in the Middle East keeps on being the same.
Now, what does that mean for Iraqis?
The United States of America invaded Iraq in2003, in what generally was conceived as a maneuver to allegedly save Iraq from its own government, which – US Intel claimed – had chemical weapons. Then, it was proven that there were no chemical weapons, but Iraq becamea dungeon for the US to play in the region, and suffered terribly its consequences. Iraqis have learned the lesson – giving Iran an opportunity to meddle in it. Iraqis don’t want their own government, they don’t want sectarianism, they refuse Iran’s involvement in Iraq’s politics, and this same refusal applies to the US. The political system that was established after the US invasion is the one that has been applied ever since, giving rise to corruption and sectarian-based tension.
It is important that the US and other Western forces acknowledge what has been going on in Iraq in these last two months, especially when it comes tohuman rights violationsand about400 civil victimsamong the participants in mostly peaceful demonstrations. If Iran has led those militias that have spread fear and death around, it is rightful to think about condemning Iran and implementing cautionary measures against it – not only for the fight against Iran’s hegemony in the Middle East (Lebanon, Syria and Iraq) but also for the rights of the own Iraqis.
It would be extremely unfair for the rest of the countries of the Middle East to see themselves involved – and paying the consequences – for a fight that is not directly theirs. It seems that even Ali Al-Sistani, Iraq’s top Shia leader, is also supporting the demonstrations – as long as they are peaceful – and reportedly hopes for democratic elections without foreign interference, may it be Iranian or foreign.

ROAD TO PRIMARIES 2020: Viaggio nella Politica Americana,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
In America la parola rivoluzionario viene usata per vendere collant.
Era il 20 Gennaio 2017 quando Trump si insediò ufficialmente e diventò il 45° Presidente degli Stati Uniti d’America. Sono passati quasi tre anni e le cose, in America e nel mondo, non sono più come prima.Immigrazione, Russia Gate, i dazi con la Cina, il ritiro dall’accordo del clima di Parigi, l’impeachment.Tutti temi che hanno provocato grosse proteste e accesi dibattiti al Congresso e soprattutto nel Partito Democratico.Se in questi anni i Repubblicani si sembrano stretti introno alla figura di Trump, i Dem sono ancora alla ricerca di una/un leader.La sconfitta di Hillary Clinton alle Presidenziali ha messo fine alla sua carriera politica, ma è il vuoto post Obama che ha provocato più danni.
La prova di questo momento di “confusione” nel “partito dell’Asino” è il numero di candidati alle Primarie 2020.Si sono presentati ben 27 persone, di cui solo 15 sono ancora in gara per vincere.
Prima di iniziare questa rubrica sullePrimarie Democratiche 2020è bene capire di cosa stiamo parlando.
Le primarie sono uno strumento che un partito può utilizzare per scegliere un candidato per una certa carica politica.
Negli Usa viene usata regolarmente, per la scelta del Sindaco al Presidente degli Stati Uniti, passando per il Congresso, Senato, Governatori, ecc.
Le Primarie per la scelta del candidato alla presidenza cambiano stato per stato, e sono due:le primarie libere,cioè che sono quelle che vengono usate per esempio anche in Italia (ad esempio nel Partito Democratico), dove ognuno vota il proprio candidato su una scheda, oppure ci sonoi caucus.
Uso un’ottima descrizione fatta dalIl Postcontenutain questo articoloper spiegarveli al meglio:
“I caucus sono regolati dai partiti statali e funzionano così: ogni partito allestisce uno o più seggi in ognuno dei micro-collegi in cui è diviso lo stato. I seggi possono essere bar, case, palestre, scuole, scantinati. I seggi vengono aperti nel tardo pomeriggio, di solito dopo le 18. Chi vuole partecipare al caucus arriva all’orario di apertura. Si fa un dibattito. Almeno un sostenitore per ogni candidato prende la parola e spiega perché bisogna votare per il suo candidato, gli altri possono rispondere. Si può fare campagna elettorale fino all’ultimo secondo, insomma.
Finita la discussione, per i Repubblicani il processo è piuttosto semplice: ogni partecipante al caucus scrive su un foglio di carta il candidato che preferisce: il voto è segreto. Per i Democratici invece è tutto molto più intricato: finita la discussione i partecipanti dichiarano pubblicamente il loro voto (con quel che ne consegue in termini di possibili pressioni “sociali”) e si dividono quindi per gruppi. C’è una specie di soglia di sbarramento: se ci sono candidati rappresentati da un gruppo troppo piccolo, quel gruppo si scioglie e i suoi partecipanti ne scelgono uno di un altro candidato. A quel punto si conta, in proporzione, il sostegno per ogni candidato. I risultati non esprimono direttamente un sostegno ai candidati bensì ai relativi delegati di seggio, che poi sceglieranno i delegati di contea, che poi sceglieranno i delegati statali, ma ci siamo capiti.“
I risultati di queste due tipologie di primarie funzionano come l’elezione del POTUS, cioèun’elezione semi-diretta. Ogni singolo stato ha un numero di delegati in base alla sua popolazione (es. il Texas ha 222 delegati, il Kansas ne ha 33), in base ai voti ottenuti i vari candidati si aggiudicano un numero di delegati che insieme ad una minoranza di super-delegati, che sono slegati dal voto popolare, andranno a formare la convention di luglio e voteranno il loro candidato Presidente.
Abbiamo parlato delle due tipologie di primarie, ma non di quando sono.Questi sono i primi appuntamenti:
Finirà tutto con la convention a Milwaukee dal 13 al 16 Luglio 2020
Tradizionalmente le primarie arrivano negli stati più grandi, quindi con maggiori delegati, solo dopo alcuni mesi dall’inizio. Questa cosa permette solo ai candidati più forti e più votati di avere più possibilità di ottenere più delegati in palio e raggiungere più velocemente la vittoria.
In queste primarie però ci sono delle novità.Per avere maggiore rilevanza politica e, soprattutto, mediatica, i due stati più grandi degli Usa, California e Texas, hanno deciso di anticipare le loro primarie al 3 marzo, con il cosiddetto “Super Tuesday”.Questo cambiamento di date permetterà quasi sicuramente alla maggior parte dei candidati di essere ancora in gara per la vittoria. Dopo solo un mese dall’inizio di queste primarie già il 36% dei delegati sarà assegnato.
In ordine alfabetico sono: Micheal Bennet,Joe Biden, Micheal Bloomberg, Cory Booker,Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Deval Patrick,Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer,Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang.In grassetto sono i candidati che nei sondaggi hanno potenzialmente più possibilità di giocarsela per la vittoria finale.
Come ci ha insegnato la politica americana e internazionale negli ultimi anni è difficile oggi dire chi può vincere. Joe Biden è in vantaggio nei sondaggi nazionali, ma la scalata del giovane Buttigieg desta molta attenzione nei vari ambienti politici.Sanders e Warren, quasi due facce della stessa medaglia, hanno una buona percentuale di consensi considerando soprattutto le loro idee molto radicali per la politica americana.
Interessante considerare che Bernie Sanders ha ancora un budget di circa 33 milioni di dollari (dati del 15 ottobre 2019) da investire nella campagna elettorale, la Warren 25 milioni di dollari, Buttigieg 23 milioni di dollari mentre Biden “solamente” 9 milioni di dollari.
Le Primarie più affollate della storia, tre candidati “boomers” in testa ai sondaggi nei Dem, un Presidente sotto il fuoco incrociato dell’impeachment e di scandali vari.
E’ un ottimo momento per iniziare a seguire la politica americana.

La Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos y su Odisea,"Por Beatriz Lasheras Mas
La Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos ha cumplido 71 años esta semana.
Un documento que la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas aprobó el10 de diciembre de 1948para proteger a los más vulnerables.
El texto, con un planteamiento universal, ha sido traducido a más de 370 idiomas. Contiene principios tan básicos como laigualdad, la libertad de pensamiento y de expresión, el derecho a la educación o a un trabajo digno, entre muchos otros, con el fin de garantizar la libertad, la justicia y la paz global. Sin embargo, la aplicación de este documento a nivel mundial aún parece una utopía.
Muchos países carentes de una democracia niegan la libertad de pensamiento a sus ciudadanos. Aquellos en los que además la religión está ligada al poder se reprime la libertad de creencia. Incluso en Europa, un continente que presume de liderar el cumplimiento de los derechos humanos, se vulneran muchos de ellos.
La crisis económica puso de manifiesto, sobre todo en los países mediterráneos, que no todos los europeos pueden disfrutar del derecho a un trabajo digno. Y la crisis migratoria ha puesto de manifiesto queEuropa es capaz de dejar morir a migrantes en sus puertas negando el artículo tercero, un derecho fundamental:el derecho a la vida, a la libertad y a la seguridad.

"EU & ENVIRONMENT: Climate Change is an Emergency, but Not All States Might Afford to Fight It 🇪🇺","by our contributor Thinkingfox
In a period when many states world-wide are detaching themselves from climate agreements, the European Union seems to have found a right path to follow.
The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, believes that theGreen Deal, presented to the European Parliament on December 11th, is “Europe’s man on the moon moment.” The aim is to agree on policies that will allow EU states to be ‘climate neutral’ by 2050.
Among many proposals, there is acommon EU Climate Law, a target of net-zero carbon, and a reduction of CO2 emissions by more than a half. This deal strengthens the EU under many points of view, especially under the economic and social aspect.
As a matter of fact, the EU’s economy could compete with China’s moves towards sustainability. And, EU states will also be able to account for citizens’ increasing awareness about climate change. However, the Green Deal has also addedpolitical instabilityto the already-unstable situation caused by Brexit on the corner. Some states, likePoland,Hungaryand theCzech Republic, have opposed the deal as their economies are very dependent on coal energy.
Probably, it will be very difficult for them to keep pace with the Western European states, which are already a step forward in terms of recycling, waste disposal, and alternative sources of energy.
The case of Poland is very interesting, because Poland has been under pressure from the EU to reduce the share of coal in electricity production, and it has been seeking a nuclear power plant for years. Although von der Leyen proposed to increase EU’s budget from 165.8 billion euros to 265.8 billion euros to help energy transition,the budget that will be assigned to help Poland,as well as the other states,does not meet the proposals on the necessary budget per yearmade by the respective national economic institutes.
• Will the EU Green Deal contribute to reduce economic instability that Brexit might cause?• Is the EU Green Deal really accounting for the needs of European states and citizens?• Are Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic opposing the deal solely because it is not enough to help them with energy transition?

La victoria de Boris Jonhnson abre la puerta a Brexit, poniendo fin a la interminable secuencia de vacilaciones y dudas que han caracterizado los últimos tres años y medio de la política británica.
El día después de la votación, Bruselas volvió a respirar tranquilamente, borrandola hipótesis de un Brexit sin ningún acuerdo y sobre todo el final de los aplazamientos interminables por su salida.
De hecho, esta es una buena noticia y permitirá que tanto la Unión Europea como el Reino Unido recuperenclaridad en la gestión de las negociaciones. Pero, sin embargo, eso no es todo. Sin Londres – históricamente una piedra en el zapato para profundizar el carácter político de la Unión – Europa podría ganar en términos de cohesión interna y así recuperar el impulso hacia su integración política.
Al mismo tiempo, podría ser el momento adecuado para que el Reino Unido determine un nuevo papel para sí mismo en la escena internacional. No es ningún secreto que la visión de Londres de sí misma no ha sido objeto de revisión o reflexión desde la pérdida de su estatus imperial.
No sabemos cuáles serán las consecuencias reales de esta salida de Europa.
Seguramente el nuevo gobierno se enfrentará al reto de mantener su reino intacto. En primer lugar, Londres tendrá que hacer frente a lasintenciones escocesas de celebrar un referéndum sobre su independencia. No cabe duda de que la cuestión del referéndum podría pasar fácilmente de ser una amenaza del período electoral – dada la voluntad escocesas de permanecer en la UE – a una verdadera acción política.
En segundo lugar, tendrá que abordar la cuestión muy delicada de cómo gestionar lafrontera entre Irlanda del Norte y del Sur, sin socavar la integridad constitucional británica, y volver a sacar a la superficie cuestiones que se remontan a la época de los troubles.

Is Impeaching Donald Trump Enough? 🇺🇸,"by Marta Moretti
“No One is above the law”, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when announcing the impeachment towards President Trump.
What is an Impeachment?
The process via which a legislative body levels charges against a government official – hence, itdoes not imply per se a definitive removal of someone from office, as it is similar to an indictment in criminal law.
Donald Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in historic vote: two articles of impeachment against him,abuse of powerandobstruction of Congress.
230 votes out of 197: the approval of the first article of the impeachment was ”abuse of power”, while the second was for “obstruction” of Congress (with 229 votes out of 198).
Before Trump,Andrew JohnsonandBill Clintonwere impeached in 1868 and 1998, without being removed from office. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the House voted on his potential impeachment.
The impeachment inquiry was firstlylaunched in September, following a July 25 phone call during which Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to open an investigation into Biden – Trump’s political rival, former vice-president, and, most importantly one of the frontrunner of 2020 Democrats Presidential elections – and his son, Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
No evidence against the Biden was found. And a $400 million Congress-approved military aid investment plan was at the time in the picture.
Now, the articles of impeachment will be sent to the Senate, the one in charge of finding evidence. The Senate is made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. At least 20 Republicans would have to vote with all Democrats and the two independents to remove the president from office.
According to the Senate Trial,two thirds of the majority of the Senateare required to convict and remove the President from office.
Yet, Ms. Pelosi and the Democrats are waiting to send the articles to the Senate.

PRIMARIES 2020: Tra Boom Economico e Disparità di Ricchezza,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
L’economia degli Stati Uniti sta vivendo la sua espansione più lunga, dieci anni dopo l’ultima recessione che si è conclusa a metà del 2009, con una crescita costante del PIL, di posti di lavoro e dei salari.Ma non tutti vedono il “bicchiere mezzo pieno.” I candidati democratici affermano che i guadagni non vengono condivisi abbastanza ampiamente.
Chiedono di spostare le “ricchezze” accumulate in questi anni nell’aumento del reddito della classe media, nei sindacati, di diminuire il potere delle grandi banche e di creare alloggi più accessibili. Stanno anche martellando Trump e i Repubblicani per aumentare il deficit e il debito.
Tutto questo si è tradotto in un inizio di campagna elettorale ricca di temi, idee e proposte. Alcune troppo difficili da applicare o da far accettare alla società americana, altre invece più di facile attuazione e che potrebbero cambiare, a poco a poco, la struttura economica degli Stati Uniti.
L’aumento del costo delle abitazioni ha portato quasi un terzo delle famiglie americane a spendere più del 30% del loro reddito per un mutuo o un affitto.
L’offerta limitata significa chegli affitti nelle città sono alle stelle, mentre il debito dilagante degli studenti impedisce a molti giovani di acquistare case.
Ecco alcune proposte fatte dai vari candidati democratici:
1.Fondi federali per costruire più case
Questo approccio allevierebbe la crisi espandendo l’offerta di alloggi. La senatriceElizabeth Warrenvuole introdurre una legislazione per investire 470 miliardi di dollari in due fondi immobiliari che darebbero agli Stati soldi per costruire, riabilitare o preservare alloggi a prezzi accessibili. Il disegno di legge dedicherebbe anche fondi per l’edilizia abitativa dei nativi americani e per l’edilizia rurale e include un aumento dei finanziamenti per l’edilizia pubblica.
2.Sussidi per affittuari e proprietari di case
Sen. Kamala Harris(che si è ritarata dalla corsa alle primarie) ha proposto una legge per creare un nuovo credito d’imposta per gli affittuari che spendono più del 30 per cento del loro reddito per l’affitto.
Il piano diAndrew Yangper un reddito di base universale darebbe a tutti $ 1.000 al mese per aiutare a sostenere il costo della vita.
3.Finanziamenti per l’edilizia, controllo degli affitti e tasse perfrenare la speculazione
Il piano “abitazioni per tutti” da $ 2,5 trilioni diBernie Sanderspropone di utilizzare fondi federali per costruire quasi 10 milioni di case e aumentare i finanziamenti per l’assistenza locativa. Il piano imporrebbe inoltreil controllo nazionale degli affitti, limitando gli aumenti degli affitti a non più del 3% o 1,5 volte il tasso di inflazione, a seconda di quale sia più elevato, e consentirebbe agli stati e alle città di imporre standard di controllo degli affitti più rigorosi.
Sanders vorrebbeimporre una tassa del 2% sul valore della proprietà delle case libere e di proprietàper “portare più unità sul mercato e frenare l’uso delle abitazioni come investimento speculativo.”
4.Combinazione di finanziamenti per l’edilizia e sussidi per l’affitto
Alcuni candidati hanno proposto un duplice approccio, che combina un controllo sugli affitti con gli sforzi per aumentare la costruzione. Il piano del senatoreCory Bookerdarebbe agli affittuari un credito d’imposta rimborsabile per coprire il deficit tra il 30 % del loro reddito e affitto dirigendo intanto 40 miliardi di $ l’anno al fondo fiduciarioHousingper costruire e gestire alloggi in locazione per le fasce di reddito più basse.
Julian Castro, ex segretario del Dipartimento per l’edilizia abitativa e lo sviluppo urbano dell’amministrazione Obama, estenderebbe il programma di voucher abitativi e creerebbe un credito d’imposta per gli affittuari. Per aumentare l’offerta di alloggi a prezzi accessibili, amplierebbe il Credito d’imposta per gli alloggi a basso reddito e aumenterebbe il finanziamento di due fondi fiduciari per sviluppare e migliorare l’edilizia pubblica di $ 45 miliardi.
Il sentimento di protesta contro le grandi banche è ancora forte tra gli elettori democratici un decennio dopo la crisi finanziaria causata dai mutui subprime (“ad alto rischio,” ndr), e molti candidati democratici hanno sottolineato il loro scetticismo, se non l’ostilità, verso Wall Street.
I democratici stanno prendendo di mira il presidente Trump e la sua“financial deregulation”,che annulla alcune regole chiave attuate sulle grandi banche nel periodo post crisi.
Report Glass-Steagall
Il Congresso del 1999 ha abrogato le disposizioni delDepression Glass-Steagall Actche impediva a una singola società di impegnarsi sia nelretailche nell’investment banking.
Alcuni democratici ritengono che dovrebbe essere ripristinata con una versione, modernizzata, di tale legge. Un’azione del genere invertirebbe effettivamente alcune fusioni verificatesi durante la crisi finanziaria del 2008, la quale ha visto fallire, diversificare o acquisire tutte e cinque le principali banche di investimento. Su richiesta del governo, JPMorgan acquistò la fallita Bear Stearns e Bank of America acquistò la travolgente Merrill Lynch.
L’economia americana sta avendo un grande boom economico, ma una buona parte dei benefici andrà a quelli del già famoso 1%. La disparità di reddito è una preoccupazione significativa per molti elettori, che sembrano sostenere ampiamente l’aumento delle tasse sui ricchi, per esempio.
I candidati presidenziali democratici stanno offrendo un elenco crescente di proposte per affrontare la questione, compresi passaggi, in alcuni casi drammatici, per ridistribuire la ricchezza della nazione.
Un Reddito di Base Universale
Tra i candidati presidenziali del 2020, il reddito di base universale è la soluzione proposta più radicale per affrontare la disparità di reddito.
Propone che il governo effettui pagamenti regolari a tutti i cittadini statunitensi, indipendentemente dal fatto che stiano lavorando o meno, senza vincoli.
“UBI” (Universal Base Income, ndr) è la proposta politica centrale diAndrew Yang, che sostiene che aiuterà gli americani a rischio di perdere il lavoro a causa dei progressi tecnologici.
Aumentare le Tasse sui Ricchi,Creando nuovi Programmi Sociali
Alcuni candidati presidenziali del 2020 chiedono aumenti fiscali per i ricchi e una grande espansione dei programmi federali che andrebbero a beneficio del resto dell’America.
Elizabeth Warren, ad esempio, ha proposto un“Ultra Millionaire Tax”sulle 75.000 famiglie più ricche degli Stati Uniti, che, a suo parere, potrebbe contribuire a pagare un piano universale per l’infanzia e la riduzione del debito dei prestiti studenteschi.
Bernie Sandersha proposto nuove tasse immobiliari sulle eredità di multimilionari e miliardari. Vuole stabilire una garanzia federale sull’occupazione “per garantire a tutti un lavoro stabile”.
Cory Bookerha proposto di creare “dei conti statali” contenenti $ 1.000 per ogni bambino americano alla nascita. Il governo pagherebbe i conti per tutta la vita del bambino e renderebbe disponibili i soldi a 18 anni per le case e l’istruzione superiore. Booker finanzierebbe i conti aumentando le tasse sugli utili patrimoniali e di capitale.
Espandere i Benefici Fiscaliper gli Americanidi Classe Media e a Basso Reddito
Mentre i grandi aumenti delle tasse per i ricchi sono sempre più in voga, un’altra opzione sul tavolo sono i crediti d’imposta che metterebbero più soldi nelle tasche della classe media e dei poveri americani.
Kamala Harrisha proposto una legislazione che fornirebbe un credito d’imposta rimborsabile fino a $ 6.000 all’anno alle famiglie che guadagnano meno di $ 100.000 all’anno.
Il Congresso non ha legiferato un minimo nazionale dall’aumento dei salari dal 2007 (quando è salito il minimo orario a $ 7,25 a partire da luglio 2009). Di conseguenza i democratici e persino alcuni repubblicani concordano che sia arrivato il momento per una nuova “correzione.” Il candidatoDonald Trumpha assunto diverse posizioni contraddittorie sulla questione nel 2016, approvando alla fine un minimo di $ 10, ma come presidente ha lasciato correre. Il direttore del Consiglio economico nazionale di Trump,Larry Kudlow, ha dichiarato a novembre che l’esistenza stessa di un salario minimo federale è stata “un’idea terribile”. Il segretario del lavoroAlexander Acostaha dichiarato al Congresso a maggio 2019 di opporsi a qualsiasi aumento del salario minimo federale.
Aumentare il Salario Minimo a $15/ora
C’è un ampio sostegno tra i candidati presidenziali democratici per raddoppiare il salario minimo orario da $ 7,25 a $ 15, e quindi permettergli di aumentare automaticamente con l’inflazione, come proposto daPartito DemocraticonelRaise the Wage Act. Anche i membri dell’ala più moderata come il senatoreAmy Klobuchar, il governatore del ColoradoJohn Hickenlooper(ritiratosi della corsa nelle primarie) e l’ex vicepresidente Joe Biden, sono favorevoli a questo.
Aumentare il Salario Minimo a $12/ora
Il senatore del Colorado,Michael Bennet, non ha firmato ilRaise the Wage Actdei Democratici, ma chiede di aumentare il salario minimo sul sito web della sua campagna. Bennet è d’accordo con l’aumento del salario partendo da $ 12 e arrivare ad un minimo federale a $ 15 nel corso del tempo. Il senatore chiede di arrivare a questa cifra “ad una velocità che non mettere a rischio posti di lavoro in zone rurali o di bassa produzione,” che sono le zone più colpite dalla crisi e più esposte economicamente.
Trump ha avuto la fortuna o la capacità di portare gli Stati Uniti in una nuova fase di crescita. Come detto però, non tutti gli americani ne stanno beneficiando. Si arricchiscono le aree già “prospere” (come le grandi città e le coste), mentre quelle zone già colpite dalla crisi non sono ancora riuscite a superarla.
Se i democratici riusciranno a intercettare il malcontento della base di Trump (quella per capire che abita nel Wisconsin, Michigan, ecc.), potrebbero avere un’ottima chance di vittoria alle presidenziali.

From Gandhi to Modi: India Between Nationalism and Ideology,"by Aurora Ceccotti
The Indian nationalist movement arose from the willing to become an independent state instead of merely being a British colony.
Although nationalism leverages the concept of protecting the traditions of a timeless nation, Modi’s policies inspired by his Hindu nationalist agenda are far from being the same as Gandhi. One of the cornerstones of Gandhi’s philosophy, for example, was respect for all religions. This concept does not seem to be embraced by the governing party (BJP), considering the citizenship bill that recently passed.
The bill grants citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who settled in India before the 31st of December 2014. This excludes the Muslim minority, which accounts for 15% of the Indian population.
The exclusion is deemed to be discriminatory, both by the opposition parties and the UN. Public discontent eventually led to asignificant number of people to protest. The police responded with violent coercive measures; currently, 22 people lost their lives in the demonstrations.
The citizenship bill is just one piece of the Hindu nationalist puzzle. In August, article 370 was revoked by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), thus withdrawing Kashmir’s autonomy.
Modi’s nationalist-populist agenda seems to be ineffective, if not disruptive when speaking of economic growth. Reforms to attract foreign investments are not enough, as FDI significantly decreased in 2019. Figures seem to contradict Modi’s denial of economic fragility. In fact, India’s GDP growth is at its slowest rate since 2013.

UK: a three-year-old Brexit – Projections & Perspectives,"By Francesco Felici
It was June 23rd of 2016 when the UK with a 51.9% majority of voting decided to take their country outside the European Union.
By appealing to thearticle 49A(art. 50 TEU) of the Lisbon Treaty, London had started a process of detachment from the Union that would have affected all the remaining 27 Member States.
Now, more than 3 years later,Theresa May– the leader that was to supposed to take the UK out of the Union – had been replaced byBoris Johnson. The latter, with an hairstyle that resembles Donald Trump, and a political narrative similar to the ones of Oswald Mosley, has recently smashed the election by a landslide with 358 votes in the House of Commons.
For a fleeting moment, it seemed like the dream of a more left-wing oriented England captained by Jeremy Corbyn could have happened, and that the whole Brexit could have been reconsidered. Nonetheless, thesupremacy of the Toriesand the Conservative party once again prevailed.
Now, Johnson has already stated that he wants to take theUK out of the Union by January 31st, and it seems now that a harsh Brexit it is the way they are going to go.
The end of this uncanny political process is yet to be written, but we can be sure that the repercussion of this event will be felt for years inside and outside the European Union.

UUEE 2020: El Futuro de Europa,"Por Beatriz Lasheras Mas
Clickhereto read the article in English.
La nueva década será de crucial importancia para el futuro de la Unión Europea. En una era de desencanto político, donde el sentimiento europeísta está siendo sustituido por posiciones nacionalistas, los cimientos de la unidad del continente se tambalean.
Hay muchos retos abiertos que Europa deberá afrontar en este 2020 y la forma en la que el conjunto de países miembros actúe marcará el devenir del continente. ElBrexitque, tras más de tres años de negociaciones, se consumará a principios del nuevo año; la crisis migratoria que está dividiendo al continente; el auge de partidos nacionalistas que rechazan la integración europea; o la crisis climática, son algunos de los principales problemas que marcarán el principio de la década.
La integración europea ha supuesto una gran cesión de competencias y dinero por parte de los países miembros, mermando la capacidad de decisión de los propios países en materias fundamentales como la economía. Pero también ha aportado muchas cosas a cambio:financiaciónpara la modernización de los países europeos menos desarrollados,librecirculación de personas y de mercancías,subvencionespara construir infraestructuras que mejoren las conexiones en el continente yoportunidadesmediante programas como Erasmus+ que permiten a los estudiantes formarse en el extranjero.
Con la llegada de la nueva década, todos los europeos deberíamos reflexionar sobre la Europa que queremos.
Es tiempo de decidir si queremos más o menos Europa.

The member states have been to transfer lot of competences and money in support of a supranational organization, reducing their decision-making capacity in fundamental matters such as Economy.

LIBYA: a Story of Never Ending Conflict,"Libya has been the core of turmoil ever since Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011, and when everyone hoped that the situation would get better it actually got worse. More than half a year ago, General Khalifa Haftar launched an attack on Tripoli in the attempt of unseating Fayez Al-Sarraj, the internationally recognized leader of Libya.
Due to its strategic location and its oil possessions, Libya is an interesting asset to control by international actors. In fact, Turkey – who held control of Libya during the Ottoman Empire – has been active in Libya’s territory “to liberate and help the Libyan people”. Its involvement in Libya is expected to rise gradually as an affair of state, and its implications lead us to think that the interests, consequences and diplomatic moves of this war may be bigger than conceived, as the international “blocks” of power expand their wings to the North African country.
The war between the Western and the Eastern parts of Libya are the proof of a deeper conflict: Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the eastern part, the Lybian National Army [LNA] (as opposed to the GNA in the West), has been attacking Tripoli and has been sought for war crimes. A conflict that seems to have no end has left 2000 casualties and hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians.
The war has become not only a civil war, but an international and regional war with so much at stake. The GNA is recognized by the global West, and supported by Qatar and Turkey. The LNA, on the other hand, is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, France and Russia, the latter having a visible presence in the battlefield.
Turkey doesn’t hide its active interest in the conflict either, showing reminiscences of an ancient colonial will. Trump’s vision on the conflict has been quite confusing and, as a result, the United States’ presence in Libya has not been very conciliating. Israel, Cyprus and Greece have been having an eye on this war that grows day by day, which can have devastating consequences for so many. Egypt, where a major gas field was discovered, thinks that the Lybian conflict will bring serious problems to the area as a whole.

LIBIA: El Aplastante Ruido de las Armas hace fracasar cualquier Diálogo Politico,"Por Vittoria Corrado
Libia, tras el derrocamiento del régimen del coronel Gaddafi, parece haber perdido incluso la esperanza de paz. El país vive desde 2011 en una fuerte inestabilidad política y sigue siendo escenario del sangriento conflicto entre los señores de la guerra y los conflictivos intereses estratégicos internacionales por el control de sus recursos petroleros y la creación de áreas de influencia.
El conflicto libio es, en última instancia, el escenario de la confrontación entre las potencias regionales, en particular entre Qatar, los Emiratos Árabes Unidos y Arabia Saudí. Pero tambien ve la implicación de Rusia, Turquía y de los países europeos, hecho que responde a un mecanismo de monitoreo y balanceo de las alianzas regionales asociadas a los dos frentes internos.
Por un lado, el gobierno de Trípoli – liderado por el primer ministro Fayez al Sarraj – cuenta con el apoyo económico y militar de Turquía y Qatar, así como de mayoría de los países europeos.En cambio, las tropas del mariscal rebelde Jalifa Hafter – que controla Bengasi y el este de Libia – de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Arabia Saudita, Egipto y recientemente también de Rusia, como lo demuestran las imágenes en Internet de la presencia de mercenarios rusos.
El continuo fracaso de los intentos de las Naciones Unidas de entablar un diálogo político, junto con la ambigüedad del comportamiento de la comunidad internacional – se manifiestan en las reiteradas violaciones del embargo de armas – nos devuelve a una situación de bloqueo absoluto y no permite hacer previsiones optimistas para el futuro.
Sin embargo, la posibilidad de un acuerdo entre las potencias externas sigue abierta, pero cualquier compromiso que no incluya la participación de los propios actores nacionales podría ser aún más peligroso para el destino de Libia.

Trump On The Ropes: Impeachment or Lies?,"By Lucìa BallesterBellver
“Today is going to be a lot of things. […] What it is not is fair. What it is not is about the truth.” On December 18th 2019, these words were pronounced, clear and concise, by Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, after theUnited States House of Representativesapproved this trial against its President.
The controversial leader, Donald Trump, will be the third president tried for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress: 230 votes in favor and 197 against in the first charge and 229 in favor and 198 against with the second. A dramatic debate, with tense moments, while the protests had place in the surrounding streets.
The process could end Trump’s impeachment, which broke out on social networks by saying: “How many atrocious lies of the radical left!”. The party, however, remains his and they have closed ranks around him. The fury of the president is not for less, although it almost seems a usual day at the office for Donald Trump.
The accusations are well known: his collusion with the Kremlin, his attempts to torpedo the investigations and also suspicion of criminal misdeeds in illegal campaign financing practices concerning payments to a woman to silence his alleged sexual relations within a few weeks of the 2016 elections. Also, he is in the spotlight for accepting money from foreign governments through his hotel empire as well.
His time will come in November 2020, but despite everything, his approval rating has improved six points since September, up to 45%. The base does not seem to have been affected. Meanwhile, his government continues. As do the protests.

FRANCE: Macron Renounces His Life Pension as President,"By Lucìa Ballester Bellver
The French head of state refused to benefit from a 1955 law that makes him receive for life upon leaving the Presidency an equivalent amount to the salary of a state councilor of about 6,220 euros gross per month.
France pension system is divided into 42 “special regimes” across private and public sectors. Pensions for private-sector employees are calculated based on their 25 best years of salary; meanwhile, in the public sectors, pensions are based on the last six months of salary. Under the new retirement plan, those who have worked a full career will be entitled to a monthly pension of €1,000 minimum per month.
The reform does not end here and not everyone is happy: strikes around the nation have collapsed France since controversial pension reform in December 2019: this consists on the implementation of a single points-based system with a mandatory minimum retirement age of 62 instead of 42 separate schemes that provided early retirement for many public-sector workers.
Macron then,  becomes the first French president to renounce his life pension as former president of the Republic. He will not receive it at the end of your term, or when he will retire.

In August, Assam, a state in northeast India, was the first Indian state to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with a list that failed to include 1.9 million of citizens, most of them Muslims. It was asked to the citizens to present any documents able to demonstrate the presence on the territory before 1971, requirement which would seem to demonstrate the “Indianess” of residents.
The State government’s declared intention is to detect illegal immigrants who crossed the borders without documents and permission. The last time the register was implemented was after India’s independence in 1951.
On November 20th, Home Minister Amit Shah declared during a parliamentary session that the register would be extended to the entire country. It hasn’t been approved yet, but it is added to a recent bill passed on 11thDecember by the Parliament of India, it could has a deleterious effect. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) offers citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh and fleeing from religious persecution, but not Muslims. It amends Citizenship Act of 1951 causing a nationwide protest prompted by the fear of excluding 200 million Muslim and India secularism. The turmoil caused hitherto 25 deaths.
To reflect on the role of Muslims in India, the Ayodhya dispute (in Uttar Pradesh), concluded on 9thNovember 2019 even if stretched back to more than a century ago, can be mentioned. The issue hinged on the fact who was the “lawful owner” of a site where a mosque, Babri Masjid, stood before a rally destroyed it and where a Hindu temple was built. It is believed that deity Lord Rama was born here.
This disputed site was the centre of a religious, social and ideological clash that in 1992 led to the death of 2000 people. As a temporary measure, in 2010 Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres of land would be divided between Hindus and Muslims, but the final verdict recognised that the land belongs to the government and an Hindu trust will be in charge of building a temple, whereas the counterpart will receive an alternative plot of land.
Let’s remember that India is a signatory State of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights, which, at article 13, states that through education, all State parties undertake to  “promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations and all racial, ethnic or religious groups”. But above all, Article 25 in the Constitution of India recognises the “freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion”.

"CHINA: Uyghurs, a Forgotten Ethnic Group?","By Francesca Mele
Xinjiang, the region in the far northwest of China, is well-known to be home for various ethnic groups  as, just to name a few, Han, Kazakhs, Tibetans, Kyrgyz. It is an autonomous region of China where also an ethnic group called Uyghurs reside.
Muslims and Turkish speakers, Uyghurs are supposed to be under arrest in the so-called “vocational training centres”, which critics defined as internment camps.  It is believed that at least one million Uyghurs are detained here.
Beijing justifies it as measure taken in order to re-educate them and as a preventive tool against extremism and terrorism. Repression started when deadly ethnic clashes broke out and it was the starting point to set up a sweeping crackdown.
On 22ndDecember, a rally was held in Hong Kong to raise awareness on Uyghurs’ conditions, but it was stopped by the police as a group of protesters tried to burn a Chinese flag. Protesters waved Uyghurs’ flag and posters asking for freedom not only for Hong Kong itself, but also for this minority group.
International attention has been slowly drawn by NGOs and governments: earlier in this year Turkey broke its silence denouncing China for violation of minority groups rights; lately the US House of Representatives passed a bill, The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, to condemn China’s violation against Uyghurs and to demand Trump administration to shed light on conditions on the camps.

PRIMARIES 2020: I Rapporti con la Cina e la Questione Immigrazione,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
Durante la campagna elettorale di quattro anni fa Trump aveva sottolineato due temi per far “ridiventare grande l’America”: una maggiore ricchezza interna e bloccare l’immigrazione.
Se il muro che blocca le “orde di clandestini” dal Messico è ancora oggi più una metafora che qualcosa di veramente concreto, la guerra dei dazi con la Cina ha avuto l’obiettivo di rendere gli Stati Uniti più forti commercialmente.
Entrambi i temi sono diventati, obbligatoriamente, centrali nelle Primarie Democratiche e bisogna capire come si muoveranno i candidati per dare una risposta diversa dal Presidente.
Il commercio è fondamentale per l’approccio economico di Trump. Ha cercato di rielaborare offerte esistenti, riallineare i rapporti commerciali e sfidare la Cina per la supremazia in settori strategici come quello tecnologico.
L’uso aggressivo delle tariffe ha iniettato incertezza nei flussi commerciali globali, provocato gli alleati europei e rimescolato la politica interna preoccupata del commercio.
Il Presidente Trump ha lanciato un’offensiva contro la Cina, nel tentativo di fare pressione a Pechino per cambiare le sue pratiche sulla proprietà intellettuale.
La Casa Bianca infatti pensa che il governo cinese spii e rubi i segreti commerciali da compagnie straniere che vogliono operare nel mercato cinese.
Se da una parte esiste il supporto da entrambe le parti per l’obiettivo dell’amministrazione, alcuni sostengono che l’approccio di Trump è rischioso, troppo dipendente sulle tariffe, e meno efficace di un piano che enfatizza lavorare insieme con gli alleati.
La posizione più popolare è quella di sostenere l’obiettivo generale di Trump di affrontare la Cina mentre critica la sua dipendenza dalle tariffe, che secondo i critici sono economicamente dannose. La maggior parte dei democratici ha sottolineato che gli Stati Uniti devono affrontare le pratiche commerciali sleali della Cina collaborando con alleati come il Giappone e l’Unione europea.
Il senatore Kamala Harris, ad esempio, ha concordato con le conclusioni dell’amministrazione Trump sulle pratiche commerciali sleali di Pechino. Ma ha espresso preoccupazione per il fatto che le azioni di Trump per reprimere la Cina siano “controproducenti”.
Altri candidati, come il sindaco di South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, hanno sottolineato di voler lavorare con la Cina su alcune questioni, come i cambiamenti climatici, e andare oltre il commercio per affrontare le violazioni dei diritti umani di Pechino.
Nel complesso, alcuni critici sono stati meno favorevoli nell’affrontare aggressivamente la Cina, avvertendo che la ricaduta delle tariffe è un onere eccessivo per gli agricoltori, i produttori e altri americani.
L’ex vicepresidente Joe Biden si è concentrato su un messaggio che minimizza la minaccia cinese e esprime invece fiducia nei lavoratori e nella tecnologia americana.
L’amministrazione Obama ha portato la negoziazione del Trans – Pacific Partnership, con 12 paesi come il Giappone, l’Australia e il Cile. Questo accordo doveva bloccare alti standard commerciali per creare un contrappeso contro la Cina.
Trump ha infranto l’accordo durante la sua campagna del 2016, definendolo “uno stupro del nostro paese”. Dopo aver ritirato gli Stati Uniti dall’accordo il suo terzo giorno in carica, gli 11 membri rimanenti sono passati e hanno approvato un accordo rielaborato. Alcuni lo chiamano TPP 2.0, ma il nome formale è CPTPP.
L’ex vicepresidente Joe Biden è stato tra i candidati più favorevoli, anche se ha promesso di rinegoziare gli aspetti e ha detto che si sarebbe assicurato che gruppi di lavoro e ambientali fossero strettamente coinvolti in quei colloqui. Biden, che era un forte sostenitore del TPP quando faceva parte dell’amministrazione Obama, ha sottolineato la necessità che gli Usa abbiano un accordo Asia – Pacifico.
“O la Cina scriverà le regole della strada per il 21 ° secolo sul commercio”, ha detto.
Alcuni democratici si sono schierati con Trump e non hanno mostrato alcun interesse a ricongiungersi all’accordo sul Pacifico.
Del presidente Donald Trump gli sforzi per ridurre l’immigrazione clandestina e per sostituirla con un sistema basato sul merito individuale saranno probabilmente temi della campagna significativi nel 2020. I candidati dovranno chiarire la loro posizione sul muro di confine, sul trattamento dei richiedenti asilo e sulle politiche restrittive come il divieto di viaggio di Trump.
Anche i democratici hanno molte priorità. Negli ultimi anni hanno spinto per un percorso verso la cittadinanza degli 11 milioni di immigrati privi di documenti del paese, con particolare attenzione ai “Dreamer” portati negli Stati Uniti da bambini. Faranno pressioni per elaborare piani di immigrazione più ampi che si occupino di visti e lavoratori ospiti.
Il Presidente Trump appena eletto nel 2017 si impegnò subito per eliminare gradualmente il DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), un programma che offriva recupero e permessi di lavoro per gli immigrati senza documenti portati negli Stati Uniti da bambini. La decisione di Trump – temporaneamente bloccata dai tribunali federali – ha lasciato lo status di quasi 700.000 “Dreamers” nel limbo.
I democratici hanno criticato la mossa e probabilmente reagiranno con le proprie proposte per fornire un percorso alla cittadinanza per i destinatari del DACA e un più ampio numero di immigrati privi di documenti.
I democratici sostengono un percorso verso la cittadinanza per i Dreamer portati negli Stati Uniti da bambini. Il percorso sarebbe aperto anche a quelli coperti dal programma DACA.
Alcuni candidati appoggiano un percorso di cittadinanza per i sognatori, ma intraprenderebbero anche azioni esecutive che potrebbero consentire loro di ottenere lo status giuridico se il Congresso non approva la legislazione.
Numerosi candidati democratici sostengono l’eliminazione delle sanzioni penali per l’ingresso illegale nel paese. Alcuni candidati hanno chiesto espressamente di abrogare la Sezione 1325 del Titolo 8 del Codice degli Stati Uniti, che rende l’attraversamento del confine senza subire un’ispezione da parte di un funzionario dell’immigrazione.
L’amministrazione Trump utilizzato lo statuto per giustificare la separazione famiglie sotto il suo pari a zero, una strategia che divise migliaia di famiglie nella primavera del 2018. Nel quadro della politica, gli adulti sono stati accusati di ingresso illegale e detenuti per il procedimento penale. Sono stati separati dai loro figli, che sono stati quindi etichettati come “non accompagnati”.
Mentre alcuni democratici hanno sostenuto l’abrogazione dello statuto dell’ingresso illegale come il mezzo più diretto di annullare la linea dura dell’immigrazione di Trump, gli altri non supportano la depenalizzazione.
Alcuni democratici vogliono cancellare la Sezione 1325 dalla legge federale. Sostengono che protegga il duro trattamento sulle famiglie dei migranti e degli individui che arrivano al confine.
“Siamo molto chiari. La ragione per cui stanno separando questi bambini dalle loro famiglie è che stanno usando la Sezione 1325  che criminalizza il superamento del confine per incarcerare i genitori e poi separarli “, ha detto l’ex segretario dell’HUDJulián Castroal primo dibattito democratico primario nel mese di giugno. “Alcuni di noi su questo palco hanno chiamato per terminare quella sezione, per terminarla. … Voglio sfidare tutti i candidati a farlo. “
Castro ha aggiunto: “Penso che se vuoi davvero cambiare il sistema, dobbiamo abrogare quella sezione. In caso contrario, potremmo iscriverci tutti nel Partito Repubblicano. “
Elizabeth Warrenha dichiarato a HuffPost a giugno di essere d’accordo con la posizione di Castro. Ha dichiarato: “Non dovremmo criminalizzare mamme e bambini che cercano di fuggire dalla violenza o di cercare di costruire un futuro migliore. Dobbiamo approvare una riforma globale dell’immigrazione in linea con i nostri valori, creare un percorso verso la cittadinanza per gli immigrati privi di documenti, compresi i nostri dreamer, e proteggere i nostri confini “.
Pete Buttigieg, il senatoreKirsten Gillibrand, il senatoreKamala Harris, il senatoreBernie Sanders, l’autoreMarianne Williamsone l’imprenditoreAndrew Yanghanno alzato la mano quando gli è stato chiesto al primo dibattito democratico se ritengono che attraversare illegalmente il confine debba essere un reato civile piuttosto che un crimine.
Cory Bookerha detto al Washington Post che si oppone al procedimento penale per le persone che attraversano il confine illegalmente. Il sindaco di Miramar, in Florida,Wayne Messame il rappresentanteSeth Moultonhanno dichiarato al Post di sostenere l’eliminazione delle sanzioni penali per i valichi di frontiera illegali.
Questi candidati sceglierebbero di mantenere le pene sull’immigrazione criminale agli atti.
L’ex candidato alle presidenzialiBeto O’Rourke, in un acceso scambio con Castro durante il primo dibattito democratico di base in giugno, ha mantenuto la sua opposizione all’abrogazione della sezione 1325 e ha affermato che sta sostenendo “una completa riscrittura delle nostre leggi sull’immigrazione”.
O’Rourke ha anche accusato Castro di “guardare solo una piccola parte di questo”, aggiungendo: “Non credo che chieda troppo alle persone di seguire le nostre leggi quando vengono in questo paese”.
Il senatoreMichael Bennete il governatoreJohn Hickenloopernon hanno alzato la mano quando è stato chiesto al primo dibattito democratico se ritengono che l’attraversamento illegale della frontiera debba essere un reato civile piuttosto che un crimine.
Il muro di confine è la questione più distintiva di Trump e i democratici stanno prendendo posizione contro di esso.
La maggior parte dei candidati si oppone al tentativo di Trump di ottenere miliardi per costruire più muri. Alcuni hanno persino affermato di essere aperti a eliminare alcune barriere esistenti.
Un’altra fazione è contro il muro, ma prenderebbe in considerazione ulteriori finanziamenti nell’ambito di un più ampio accordo sull’immigrazione.
In tutto questo Trump nasconde una crisi umanitaria ai confini americani: più di 55.000 persone sono sparse tra i campi tra Usa e Messico in pessime condizioni igieniche e sanitarie.
Questa situazione è causata dall’agitazione della famosa carovana di migranti che finì qualche mese fa su tutti i televisori del mondo per poi scomparire nel nulla.
Trump, prima delle elezioni del midterm, promosse una legge chiamataMPP(Migrant Protection Protocols).Una legge che impone ai richiedenti asilo provenienti dal Messico di rimanere fuori dagli Stati Uniti finché la loro richiesta non viene esaminata.
Tutto questo fa parte di un progetto più ampio di questa amministrazione di cancellare poco a poco, o limitare il più possibile,il diritto d’asilo. Più volte il Presidente ha dichiarato che l’asilo politico è “una truffa ai danni degli americani”.
Un esempio è ilMetering,cioè la soglia massima di richieste d’asilo che i funzionari possono esaminare. In una zona di confine molto affollata come quella nel sud della California i controlli erano sui 100 al giorno, oggi al massimo possono essere 20. Questo crea una lunga lista d’attesa che obbliga le persone a rinunciare o ad entrare nel paese in vie non legali, rischiando di essere uccise o incarcerate.
Se molte associazioni stanno combattendo per vie legali per ostacolare queste leggi, Trump ha stilato un accordo chiamato“Safe third country agreements”.
Gli Stati Uniti, insieme aHonduras, El Salvador e Guatemala, si sono accordati per certificare che questi tre paesi sono abbastanza sicuri da poter deportare lì i richiedenti asilo.
Un accordo che non ha nessuna base di verità visto che questi tre paesi rientrano nelle classifiche mondiali come i paesi più pericolosi al mondo. Soprattutto è un accordo stipulato con paesi che non hanno né infrastrutture né personale per gestire le numerose pratiche di asilo.
Trump non sta fermando l’immigrazione clandestina o bloccando il traffico di persone gestito da gang o gruppi criminali, ma sta complicando e rendendo sempre più difficile un diritto basilare di molti paesi democratici.
Trumannel 1947 per calmare le proteste di alcuni americani contro l’arrivo di immigrati ebrei ed europei disse al Congresso: “le vittime di guerra e di oppressioni devono guardare ai paesi democratici perché gli aiutino a ricostruire le loro vite. L’unico corso civile è quello di permettere loro di mettere nuove radici su un suolo amico.”
Un messaggio che risuona ancora più forte oggi, sul finire del primo decennio.

"IRAQ: Soleimani, the Casus Belli","Trump proudly announced the death of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in an airstrike in Iraq on Friday 3rd January 2020. The general had been internationally sanctioned – and considered a terrorist by the US – for providing material support and weapons to Bashar Al – Assad’s government to crush the civilian uprisings.
This meaningful event occurred after Iraqi civilians revolted around the US embassy in Baghdad as a protest for the imperant presence and surveillance of America in Iraqi politics ever since the current Iraqi revolution began.
As a result of the attack on the American embassy and probably increased will after the infamous airstrike, US troops were deployed to the area – a direct act of force that may very well lead to an unexpected escalation that will involve many Middle Eastern countries.
Since the public declaration of Soleimani’s death, Iran and Iraq have been calling for revenge, and consular operations with Iraq have been severed, as America considers its citizens in the region to be in danger, although the attacked on Soleimani was deemed by the US an event that would make Americans safer. However, this attack will not only affect Americans, but also millions of lives of other Middle Easterners that are stuck in the epic rivalry between Iran and the US, like Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
It’s important to note that, since Trump’s impeachment began, there has been an ever rising need for him to prove his value in order to ensure the next elections. Killing Soleimani, whom Trump said that “he was plotting to kill American civilians” in spite of Iran or Iraq not declaring war on America officially, has been obviously a very well-thought political move. Nonetheless, the consequences this murder could bear on America may lead to another big regional war, with Americans directly involved in it.
But the US did cooperate with Soleimani in the past, most significantly in 2010, to elect the Iraqi prime minister, and in 2001, to offer America maps of Taliban bases to target after the September 11 terrorist attack.

The Soleimani Case: a Geopolitical Analysis,"by Aurora Ceccotti
The murder of Soleimani and its possible consequences led to a general fear of a third world war. Memes about young people getting ready to join the army have proliferated around the web.
This is however unlikely to happen. As far as concerns the involvement of NATO countries, Article 5 does not oblige the NATO allies to intervene in defence of the USA in case of attack. This prevents the majority of European countries from being forced to have any engagement in the conflict. Furthermore, other possible actors such as China and Russia do not have a significant role in the tensions between Washington and Iran. It is true, however, that they might have a common goal: to weaken the US influence.
Iran initially opted for a non-military response, withdrawing the nuclear deal, which, however, does not necessarily mean that they will own or use nuclear weapons.  Subsequently, Iran attacked US sites in Iraq. This was a predictable move in response to the killing of Soleimani, seen as an act of war. The lack of American casualties decreased the chances of an all-out war, and both Teheran and Washington are sending de-escalating messages.
Geopolitical events as such have a significant impact on markets.
The value of gold, being a safe haven currency, has significantly increased.
Furthermore, the price of oil increased as turbulence in the area makes oil seem to be less available, however, the de-escalation of tensions led the markets, including the oil market, to reacquire stability.
It might be true that people’s attention has shifted away from trump’s impeachment inquiry. However, Trump has achieved support allegedly being against military actions, hence, this decision does not seem to be driven by the need for popular support. Moreover, political analysists suggest that the “rally around the flag” effect (i.e. the phenomenon in which citizens react to a crisis though strongly supporting and trusting the current president) takes place when there is bipartisan support for the President’s Actions. In this specific case, the Democrats expressed their opposition to the decision taken by Trump. Indeed, the House of Representatives is voting today on a resolution aimed at limiting Trump’s decision to employ military operations.","January 11, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-soleimani-case-a-geopolitical-analysis/,Aurora Ceccotti,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
SPAIN: The First Coalition Government of the Spanish Modern Democracy,"By Beatriz Lasheras Mas
Cliqueaquípara leer el artículo en Español.
The beginning of the decade has brought a new Government in Spain: the first coalition Government of modern Spanish democracy.
On January 8, the Socialist Pedro Sánchez was approved as prime minister by the Spanish Parliament with 167 votes in favour, 165 against and 18 abstentions. The Spanish Socialist leader has renewed his leadership,this time at the polls, through a coalition agreement with Unidas Podemos. Spain has had before multiparty governments during the II Republic (1931-1936). But this is the first coalition since the death of the dictator Francisco Franco (November 20, 1975) and the restoration of democracy.
After two general elections in 2019, which won PSOE party (moderate left wing), and more than eight months of negotiations, the Socialists have been able to forge an agreement with Unidas Podemos (radical left wing) to create a progressive administration. The new Government promises to return Spain to the pre-crisis position with proposals such as raising gradually the minimum wage to 1,200 euros (currently at 900 euros), raising pensions and reforming the system to ensure its viability, repealing part of the labour reform (2012) by Partido Popular (moderate right wing), raising taxes to the highest incomes, regulating rental prices, or repealing ‘The Gag Law’ that limits freedom of expression, among others proposals.
This coalition Government will have to face really hard challenges. The first one will be to approve the economic budget of 2020. PSOE and Unidas Podemos all together donothave an absolute majority in the Parliament so they will need the support of another parties in order to carry out their proposals. Nowadays, we just can wait to see if the new government will be able to resolve the Spanish’s society issues and forge a solid governing body or if, on the contrary, the differences between both parties make the country’s governance impossible.

ESPAÑA: El Primer Gobierno de Coalición de la Democracia Moderna Española,"Por Beatriz Lasheras Mas
Clickhereto read the article in English.
El inicio de la nueva década ha traído consigo un nuevo Gobierno en España: el primer Ejecutivo de coalición de la democracia moderna española.
El pasado 8 de enero, el Congreso de los Diputados invistió a Pedro Sánchez con 167 votos a favor, 165 en contra y 18 abstenciones. El líder socialista ha renovado su mandato,está vez respaldado por las urnas, a través de un acuerdo de coalición con Unidas Podemos. España había tenido gobiernos multipartidistas antes, durante la II República (1931-1936).
Pero este es el primer Ejecutivo de coalición que se conforma en el país tras la muerte del dictador Francisco Franco (20 de noviembre de 1975) y la restauración de la democracia.
Tras dos elecciones generales en 2019, que dieron por vencedor al PSOE (centro-izquierda), y tras más de ocho meses de negociaciones, los socialistas han sido capaces de fraguar un acuerdo con Unidas Podemos (izquierda radical) para crear un Ejecutivo progresista. El nuevo Gobierno promete volver a la España anterior a la crisis, con propuestas como subir el salario mínimo interprofesional a 1.200 euros de manera progresiva (actualmente está en 900 euros), subir las pensiones y reformar el sistema para garantizar su viabilidad, derogar parte de la reforma laboral (2012) que realizó el Partido Popular (centro-derecha) en plena crisis económica, subir el IRPF a las rentas más altas, regular los precios del alquiler, o derogar la ley mordaza que limita la libertad de expresión.
Los retos con los que se encontrará este Ejecutivo bicolor no serán nada fáciles. El primer desafío será aprobar los presupuestos generales de 2020, ya que no cuentan con la mayoría absoluta en el Congreso y necesitarán el apoyo de terceros para poder sacar sus propuestas adelante. Ahora solo queda esperar para ver si el PSOE y Unidas Podemos serán capaces de dar respuesta a los problemas de la sociedad española y de forjar un Ejecutivo sólido o si, por el contrario, las diferencias entre ambos partidos hacen imposible la gobernabilidad del país.

XXI Century: The Reinassance of Anti-Semitism,"By Marianna Maddock
In the past few weeks, there has been a strong wave of anti-Semitic acts of violence in the United States, which peaked with an attack on a Hanukkah celebration at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, New York.
Unfortunately, Europe is no stranger to these assaults. On the contrary, both in Europe and the United States, Jews are constantly being assaulted on the streets. In Slovakia, tombstones are desecrated, while in the Italian town of Schio, in the Veneto region, has refused to install brass plates to commemorate Holocaust victims saying that they would be “divisive”. This fear has even reached the extent of having a synagogue in Holland to stop publicly posting its times of prayer services.
Obviously, this intolerance mainly stems from right-wing extremists, progressive leftists, as well as other minorities. And what’s more shocking is the mere fact that these acts of violence have been legitimized by the nationalist rhetoric of several political leaders in the world, including President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Raised Roman Catholic, Giuliani claimed in an interview that he’s “more of a Jew” than Holocaust survivor George Soros.
Many other religious and ethnic groups have been harmed by the rhetoric. Let’s take China’s case in the Xinjiang Province.More than a million Uyghurs have been detainedin “reeducation” camps in the Chinese Communist Party’s effort to contain and control the said ethnic group, all due to the Chinese officials’ concern that the Uyghurs might hold extremist and separatist ideas. Despite this, there is a particularly deceptive character to anti-Semitism spreading yet again which has a horrific history.
It is an extremely serious blunder to think that anti-Semitism is simply a problem for Jews – ethnic and religious intolerance is an existential threat that could hinder any minority group’s safety. It endangers us all.

Qasem Soleimani: An Untouchable International Target,"By Marianna Maddock
This new decade has already started on very unstable grounds, especially since the recent US drone attack which killed Iranian military commander, Qasem Soleimani, and Iraqi militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.
These were blatant acts of war.
Soleimani has been on the radar for several years. He was in fact a clear “enemy of the United States.” Regardless of such obvious friction, President George W. Bush, Barack Obama as well as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have all resisted the urge to eliminate Soleimani given that he was so highly regarded in Iran and by Iranian allies.
All three nation leaders definitely had plenty of opportunities to kill Soleimani, but all three were just as wise to know that creating a martyr would not benefit their countries’ interests.
Here comes the Trump Administration who chose this moment to kill Soleimani – and such a killing is being justified. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, claimed that the assassination was justified due to US intelligence suggesting that Soleimani was planning an “imminent” attack against American forces. However, no evidence was provided by Pompeo for such a claim.
If said allegations were true, then the drone attack would have been legal under the US Constitution since the US Commander in Chief is indeed obliged to provide self-defense for US service members. But again, no evidence was provided and as such, we are left with a bundle of speculation.
The aftermath of this attack is still in the making, especially as we wait to see what the Iraqi Parliament decides to do with the United States forces. The Iranians will undoubtedly respond, most probably counterbalancing the American attack on Iranian soil.

KASHMIR: A Region Between Restrictions and Public Order,"By Francesca Mele
On August 5, 2019, the Indian government announced the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which granted independence to Kashmir since 1947, when after a dispute over the territory’s independence and a Pakistani’s attack, Kashmir turned to India to ask for protection. The intervention of the Indian government in defence of Kashmir took place on the condition that from that moment on, the first one would be in charge of external affairs, defence and communications. Thus, Kashmir was not granted complete independence. As the Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah affirmed, “Article 370 has prevented J&K to merge with India rather than being a basis of its merger” and “ is equally harmful for people of all religion”. The reference to religion is important because Indian-administered Kashmir entails Kashmir Valley, Jammu, and Ladakh, counting respectively 95%, 30% and 46% of Muslims in their population.
This dispute is characterized by a degree of complexity that has persisted for years. Suffice it to say that in 1957, an Indian diplomat by the name of Krishna Menon set the record for the longest speech, which is 8 hours, before the UN Security Council talking about the reasons why Kashmir should be considered as a part of India.Probably the importance of the state lies in political, geographical and economic reasons: for India, it was about a desire to create a secular and democratic state; for Pakistan, it was about a region that could be home for South Asian Muslims. Furthermore, it is a central territory between three nuclear power states, strategic position, with great resources and  “out of six rivers that run through Pakistan three of them which include River Jhelum, Indus and Chenab originate from Kashmir while the remaining Rivers Bias, Ravi and Sutlej have their origin source in India” (R. S. Hashmi, A. Sajid,Kashmir Conflict: The Nationalistic Perspective  (A Pre-Partition Phenomenon, p.228).
Nowadays it raised concern for human rights violations, as a report released by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in July 2019 claimed. In particular, the OHCHR pinpoints two laws that constitute a threat to human rights, that are  1) public safety act (PSA), 1978, 2) armed forces (Jammu and Kashmir) special powers act (AFSPA), 1990. With PSA, a person could be detained for up to two years due to security reasons and public order. The AFSPA granted immunity to security forces making them unaccountable for what happened during possible unrest. Section 7 doesn’t allow prosecution against military forces before the government agreement. In 2018, 160 civilians were killed.
To the list, OHCHR adds other violations such as excessive use of force, arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of assembly and association, censorship and restrictions to freedom of expression. In particular, restrictions to freedom of expression is a recent concern for India’s Supreme Court. After the abrogation, Kashmir was subjected to curfew and interruptions to the normal functioning of means of communication. Internet services were suspended for more than 150 days.The Supreme Court asked New Delhi to review the suspension within a week because it compromises freedom of expression and the enjoyment of human rights. The government has until now explained its rule due to order reasons. As Anuradha Bhasin, Executive Editor of Kashmir Times, “It’s significant in the sense that the Supreme Court has in principle laid down that access to the internet is a fundamental right. It’s a basic right and cannot be denied”.

IRAN: Ukrainian Plane Crash & Political Accountability,"The Ukrainian plane that was shot down this 8th January 2020 just added more tension to an already heated situation.
This fatidic event occurred after the missile attacks between the US and Iran, after Qassem Soleimani’s murder by the order of Donald Trump. The escalation reached its peaks, and the world was expecting to get into another world war – but then, we heard Iran calling for retaliation, and other political forces asking Iran not to fall into the trap of the attacks and menaces.
When the tension seemed to be scaling down, an Ukrainian jet with 176 people on board was shot down in Iran, leaving no survivors. For 3 days, Iran denied the attack and did not want the black box to be investigated. Now it has been communicated that the aerospace forces of the government mistakenly identified the plane as an American missile.
The head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps accepted full responsibility for the incident, but still, just after the civil mourning for Qassem Soleimani, now it is hundreds of Iranians mourning and then protesting publicly asking for the resignation of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
As of the 14th January, the spokesman of Iran’s judiciary announced several arrests in regard to the plane crash, without revealing the identity of the detainees. It seems that both Ayatollah Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have made their efforts to find justice after the attack, setting up a special trial court for this case. Let’s not forget that the individuals who are guilty for this attack belong to the high rank Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a government entity.
According to official record, Iran’s president Rouhani did not know about the accident until two days later, which would mean that the IRGC kept information from the highest members of the government – which they would be held accountable for in the trial to come.
As per the big amount of demonstrators protesting the crash of the plane, things have been difficult: they have been attacked with gunshots and tear gas by the local police in Teheran, which has increased citizen rage towards the established government and the lack of sensitivity and accountability of its officials.
While evidence points at the US for beginning the new Iran-US crisis, this mistake by the Iranian government may play a significant role in Iran’s internal relations, and to the international and regional crisis as well, regardless of whether there may be a war or not. The fact that this incident shook the Supreme National Security Council and can even affect Ayatollah Khamenei – some have been asking him to resign – will certainly weaken Iran internally.

BREXIT: Where will it hurt the most?,"By Marta Moretti
The great majority of the European Parliament has eventually voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement, according to which the UK will not be any more a member of the European Union from February 1st. The approval was accompanied by the notes of “Auld Lang Syne”, sung by the MEPs of the United Kingdom.Now, a transition period will start and it will last for the next 11 months.
What about the rest of Europe?
Brexit will deepen and intensify inequalities among British nationals living in France. The first step is the requirement of acarte de séjour(residence permit) for every British resident. With the second largest population of UK citizens in Europe, France already seems to witness a growth of inequality: uncertainty, instability and poor rights especially for women and the less well-off.
Not only Brexit will affect the immigration and/or integration policies of British people living in France, but it will also impactFrench economy. As a matter of fact, a recent study published by the Dutch Rotterdam University revealed that France, given its great volume of trade with the UK, will suffer serious economic consequences.
Regarding trade and agriculture, Northern France will pay the consequences especially in the automotive sector, where Toyota and Yaris operate – and whose major trading partner was UK, amounting to the 16% of exports in 2016.There are also major economic concerns regarding the port of Calais. With the UK leaving the single market, the police and customs will have to treat it as any other third country, thus applying higher customs tariffs.

L’Italia dei Poveri e le Realtà in Lotta contro l’Indigenza,"A cura diVittoria Corrado
I numeri hanno spesso l’effetto di appiattire la portata dei fenomeni sociali, essendo il mero dato quantitativo incapace di rimandarci indietro una chiara immagine del problema della povertà in Italia.
Affermare che attualmente nella penisola ci sono 5 milioni di persone in condizione di povertà assoluta può lasciarci indifferenti se non ci si avvicina alle storie di ognuno di loro, a cosa vuol dire precipitare “dall’altra parte”, e soprattutto se non si guarda alle sfumature del fenomeno.
La prima considerazione da fare riguarda la facilità con la quale un numero crescente di persone “scivola” in uno stato di indigenza, specie quando si trova da tempo in uno stato di precarietà. Un licenziamento, la morte di un parente, il sopraggiungere di una malattia, un divorzio e la vita cambia bruscamente il suo corso e queste persone si ritrovano letteralmente per strada, senza più la possibilità di avere accesso ai beni e servizi considerati primari.
La povertà non ha un unico volto: può essere sanitaria, educativa, abitativa non solo monetaria. E questa diversità di forma è spesso ignorata a favore di una narrativa che ne mette in evidenza solo l’aspetto economico. La recente attuazione del reddito di cittadinanza mostra chiaramente come la stessa classe politica italiana affronti il tema solo in termini di mancanza di lavoro, quando il fenomeno – anche ad un’analisi forfettaria – non si può comprendere con una lente di lettura tanto limitata quanto distorsiva.
Il tema è ad oggi oggetto di due approcci molto diffusi: quello criminalizzante – che tratta l’indigenza come una colpa personale o peggio una scelta personale – e quello caritatevole, intriso di un paternalismo stantio che ignora tutto il campo delle possibili soluzioni e si dedica esclusivamente ad un aiutouna tantumche finisce per essere ininfluente per i suoi destinatari.
La buona notizia è che ci sono una miriade di piccole e medie realtà – perlopiù sconosciute e invisibili agli occhi dell’opinione pubblica – che lavora giorno e notte per contrastare le varie forme di povertà, adottando tipologie di azioni spesso molto innovative. Il loro obiettivo è quello di non lasciare nessuno solo. Perché la solitudine è il peggior meccanismo di esclusione sociale e la più grande povertà che si possa immaginare.
Iniziative come: il riciclo del pane a Roma; il cohousing a Firenze; la raccolta del reso dei supermercati e dei mercati ortofrutticoli o i progetti per facilitare il ricollocamento nel mondo del lavoro sono solo alcuni esempi di quanto viene fatto da tantissime organizzazioni a vario titolo. Quest’ultime tuttavia lavorano troppo frequentemente come delle “isole di ossigeno” per offrire sollievo ai poveri, riuscendo a raggiungere solo una piccola percentuale di loro. Non è raro infatti che vi sia una forte mancanza di dialogo e collaborazione fra pubblico e privato, che condiziona l’impatto delle misure a contrasto del problema.

MYANMAR: International Condemnation of Rohingya Genocide,"By Francesca Mele
The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote on Twitter: “The Rohingya are one of the most discriminated against and vulnerable communities on Earth” and it seems true when we analyse their story. Peaks of violence have been recorded in 1978, 1991-1992, and again in 2016. In 2017 Rohingya numbered one million but after a clash between Muslim and Buddhist factions, 700.000 were forced to flee and Bangladesh welcomed them, even if resources are running out. An humanitarian crisis is underway.
Rohingya are an ethnic group, mainly Muslim, with their own identity, language and tradition and principally residing in Rakhine State. Myanmar is a rich country of diversity: it is the home of 135 ethnic groups, more than 100 languages are spoken; but from the census of 2014 populations  from certain northern zones of Rakhine State and some villages in the states of Kachin and Kayin were not counted, as reported byMinority rights group international.
They are stateless, as they are not recognised by the government due to a citizenship law dating back to 1982, which distinguished between three categories of citizenship, namely citizenship, associate citizenship and  naturalized citizenship. According to this law, they doesn’t fit for any of these categories, causing a discrimination that has to do with the access to education, to own lands and to enjoy basic political rights.
Rohingya crisis has broken out in 2017 when armed attacks between a Rohingya group and government army ended up in some deaths for the latter, unleashing brutal repression against the minority group.
“A Human Rights Council resolution in March 2017 called on the international fact-finding mission to establish the facts and circumstances of alleged human rights violations and abuses in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine State”. (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/InvestigationAllegedHRViolationsAgainstRohingya.aspx)
Today these violations are denounced by NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, but also from the United Nations, that through its reports has confirmed heavy human rights violation, such as arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and deaths in detention. This provided the basis for the approval of the resolution on 27thDecember in which the General Assembly, in a 134-9 vote with 28 abstentions, urged the Myanmar government on defending Rohingya and minorities rights. Resolutions are not binding, but they are a clear mirror of international community opinion.
Citing the fact finding mission’s documentation, the General Assembly called for an immediate cessation of fighting and hostilities and to put an end to all discrimination and statelessness issue. Myanmar’s UN ambassador, Hau Do Suan, referred to it as example of “selective and discriminatory application of human rights norms designed to exert unwanted political pressure on Myanmar.”
On 11thNovember 2019, Gambia filed a case before the International Court of Justice against Myanmar and its alleged violation of 1948 Genocide Convention.  The ICJ, the principal judicial organ of United Nations, on 23rdJanuary 2020 delivered its order on the request submitted by Gambia and unanimously solicited The Republic of the Union of Myanmar to take measures in order to prevent and stop the perpetration of all acts, committed by the military and any irregular armed units, within the scope of Article II of Genocide convention (killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to the members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and  imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group) and invited the government to take effective measures with the aim to preserve evidence of these allegations.

On the Brink of Destruction,"By Beatriz Lasheras Mas

Set up at 100 seconds away from midnight, the Doomsday Clock is closest than ever of theWorld’s destruction. Created in 1947 by The Bulleting of the Atomic Scientist, this clock is a metaphor about how close we are of destroying our planet.
The danger of a nuclear war and climate change, besides the threat of a cyber-enabled information warfare that undercuts society’s ability to respond are the reasons why this group of scientists had set up the clock closest of catastrophe than ever. The Bulleting of Atomic Scientist clarified that the international security situation is dire, not just because these threats exist, but because the inactivity of world leaders to face these challenges.
The last two years the Doomsday Clock was setting up at two minutes of midnight. It was even closer than during the worst years of The Cold War, when United States and Soviet Union were testing hydrogen bombs. Nowadays, the Doomsday Clock’s position has beaten the record of self-destruction. Thetension between United States and Irandoes not help the situation.
A big part of History was created by wars. Weapons had made already a huge damage to humanity. The First and Second World Wars are clear examples of it. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 75 years ago. Right now, the use of atomic weapons will be even worse. As lot of times has been said it, just pressing a button our planet will be totally destroyed.

Al Borde de la Autodestrucción,"Por Beatriz Lasheras Mas
Clickhereto read the article in English.
A 100 segundos de la medianoche, ‘el reloj del juicio final’ está más cerca que nunca del apocalipsis. Creado en 1947 por el Boletín de Científicos Atómicos, este reloj es una metáfora que expresa cuánto le queda a la humanidad para autodestruirse.
El inminente peligro a una guerra nuclear y el cambio climático, junto a la desinformación cibernética que merma la capacidad de respuesta de la sociedad, son los factores en los que se sustenta la nueva posición del reloj. El Boletín de Científicos Atómicos también aprovechó para aclarar que la seguridad internacional se encuentra en peligro, no solo por la existencia de estas tres amenazas, sino también por la inactividad de los líderes mundiales.
Los últimos dos años, el ‘reloj del juicio final’ estaba a dos minutos de la medianoche. Incluso más cerca de la autodestrucción que durante los peores años de la Guerra Fría, cuando Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética estaban ‘jugando’ con bombas de hidrógeno. Hoy en día, la tensión entre EEUU e Irán no ayuda a la situación.
Gran parte de la Historia ha sido escrita por guerras. La Primera y la Segunda Guerra Mundial son ejemplos claros. El lanzamiento de las bombas atómicas en Hiroshima y Nagasaki fue hace 75 años y acarreó consecuencias que aún perduran. Los daños de una bomba atómica ahora serían incluso peores. Como muchas veces ya se ha dicho, estamos a solo un botón de la destrucción total.

This Is What It Means To Say Cultural Appreciation,"By Francesco Felici
Super Bowl final, February 2020. The football teams San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Pitchers face each other in the biggest sport event in the world. With over 102 million people watching it live, this night is supposed to be a moment of glorification for the American culture. However, this worldwide show became once again a display of the complicated history between the United States and their Native culture.
All throughout the tournament, the Kansas-City team – which ultimately won the Super Bowl – was highly contested for their supporting chants. The so called “Tomahawk Dance” involves all the Kansas fan dressing up as Native Americans – complete with feathery headpieces and face paints – and wildly scream and cheer to support their team. Whereas this event could easily be dismissed as a minor concern, this choreography actually entails a variety of issues that are at the core of the convoluted relations between the so called, “Indians” and the US.
Indeed, by wildly chanting and screaming these supporters are depicting Native Americans as this brute and belligerent people in front of 102 million people. Not only that, they are doing so in order to intimidate their opponent by showing their savagery. They are saying “we are dangerous rabid people, thus you should fear us.”
Many Americans broadcasts have tried to sugar-coat this whole situation by comparing it to theHaka, the famous ritual dance that the All Blacks (the national New Zeland rugby team) perform before every match. However, they could not be further apart. The Haka ritual dance reflects a tribal heritage that has been integrated into a modern society, whereas the Tomahawk dance is a display of complete misunderstanding of a neighboring culture.
This episode perfectly encapsulates the butchering of Native American culture in the modern American society. Indeed, the idea of the West as a spiritual land inhabited by forces that go beyond the understanding of men has drastically crumbled before the American capitalist project. Thus, not only an entire population has been largely slaughtered and stripped of his native lands, but now the same population is also forced to watch as their culture is reduced to a gimmick.
Many different medias have tried to depict the struggle of the Native Americans to adapt in this new modern world, but only few quite achieved whatSmoke Signalsdid in 1998. The movie is based on the short story “This is what it means to say Phoenix Arizona” by Sherman Alexie, who has also contributed in the script for the movie. The story revolves around the journey of Victor and Thomas-build-the-fire – two Native Americans who live in the reservation of Idaho – who embark on a journey to Phoenix Arizona to retrieve the ashes of Victor’s estranged father, Arnold.
Since the very beginning of the movie it is established the different understanding of what it means to be Indian for our two main characters. Victor is constantly angry at the world for the way he had to grow up stranded in a reservation in Idaho away from the rest of the world. Also, he has forsaken his Native American traditions and has adopted a more “corporate” way of presenting himself by going around with a suit and getting rid of his braids. On the other hand, we can see how Thomas Build-the-fire is more in touch with his tribal roots, and throughout the movie he becomes a sort of narrator by exploring the themes of family, traditions and values. Indeed, Thomas is a story-teller, and a big chunk of the movie is just him telling stories on their journey to Phoenix with his dream-like narration.
This is the outside layer of the movie: a story of rebirth and discovery through a cross country journey of two young man, and it is actually a quite light tone that most audience would enjoy. However, there is so much more than meets the eyes.
Smoke signalsdeals with the conditions of Native Americans inside of the reservations. The movie shows how the people resent being stranded in the middle of nowhere, and how they usually result in alcoholism and violence due. This is presented in the character of Arnold – Victor’s father – who was an alcoholic and actually caused the death of Thomas’s father. By showing us how much Victor’s initially resents his father, the director Chris Eyre is creating the perfect metaphor for the position of Native American tribes in these reservations.
Ultimately,Smoke Signalsis about not only what it means to be Indian but what it means to be human in a broader sense. The movie excels in conveying the sense of belonging to the land of the Native American culture, as well as exposing the grudge they feel for they were stripped of such land. In this road trip movie both Alexie and Eyre resume all the wronging that this population has suffered, as well as their inherent pride and spiritualism.
Thus, many of the so called “true American “should think twice before going on live televisions with painted faces and feathers on they head, and they should really learn to pay respect to a culture of which only fault was to trust the white man.

“Don’t Touch The Children”: Spanish Parents To Protest “Parental Pin”,"By Lucía Ballester Bellver
The problems in Spain have only just begun. After the formation of the first coalition government of democracy (not without shading some doubts), new challenges arise for the country.
Not only are there so many people unhappy with this government per se: the pacts with the terrorist gang ETA (now Bildu), the tense anti-clerialal statements, and now a new problem that has definedly touched the sensitive fiber of a sector of the population with much to say: parents.
First of all, we should know what isthe parental pin. This parental pin is so called a “weapon that allows parents to stop their children attending talks, workshops or classes during school hours whose content ‘goes against their moral principles’”. This has become the epicenter of a heated school debate.
Just as a section of the left wing parties is against being taught religion to their children, in the right they are against losing control of the education of minors. There is a conflict of interest between parents who want their children to be properly educated and teachers who have an obligation to teach, but without moving the red line of indoctrination.
Spain’s new Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, described the measure as an “attempt at educational censorship”. It is no surprise to know that one of the proposals of the far-left PartyUnidas Podemos is to have the control over education.
However, doesn’t a father know better what’s best for his son? Shouldn’t parents protect the most vulnerable and easy to manipulate? Time will tell who’s right.

Diritto e dovere significa obbligo a votare?,"A cura di Milena Di Nenno
Votare è un diritto e un dovere del cittadino in ogni democrazia liberale. I cittadini hanno il diritto di decidere da chi essere rappresentati, e il dovere di scegliere per consolidare i valori democratici. Tuttavia, sembra che ci sia sempre più disinteresse nei confronti della politica, e in molti casi anche forte delusione scaturita da scelte passate. Nell’indecisione, è meglio non recarsi a votare, perché – detto all’italiana- “i politici sono tutti ladri che scaldano le poltrone.”
Evidentemente, questa problematica non viene riscontrata soltanto in Italia. Sono 22, infatti, gli stati del mondo in cui votare non è solo un diritto e un dovere, ma anche un obbligo di ciascun cittadino. Obbligo perché non recarsi alle urne comporta la restrizione di alcuni privilegi e, talvolta sanzioni pecuniarie.
In Uruguay, viene tolta la possibilità di lavorare in enti pubblici o di dare esami all’università. In Brasile, si viene privati del diritto a ottenere un passaporto o un mutuo statale. Restringendo il campo all’Europa, è obbligatorio votare in Danimarca, Cipro, Grecia, Liechtenstein, Lussemburgo e Belgio. In Belgio, ad esempio, si corre il rischio di dover pagare una multa tra i 30 e i 60 euro e, se non ci si reca alle urne per quattro volte in 15 anni, si può essere radiati dalle liste elettorali per 10 anni durante i quali non si può ricevere alcuna promozione, nomina o premio distintivo dalle autorità pubbliche.
In questi Paesi, l’obbligo al voto è una misura per contrastare il crescente fenomeno dell’astensionismo. Non a caso, è il Belgio che ha registrato la maggior percentuale di affluenza alle urne delle Elezioni Europee 2019. L’88,47% della popolazione belga ha votato per eleggere il Parlamento Europeo. In Italia, l’affluenza è stata quasi la metà, 54,5%. In Slovacchia, solamente il 22,74% della popolazione si è recata a votare.
L’affluenza per le Elezioni Europee permette sicuramente di confrontare diversi stati chiamati a votare per la stessa istituzione, ma porta alla luce problematiche che vanno oltre il voto, come ad esempio il ‘deficit democratico’ dell’Unione Europea o il ruolo che ciascuno stato ha avuto nel processo di formazione dell’UE. In molti sostengono che, quanto più i cittadini sentono l’istituzione vicina alle loro necessità, tanto più si recano alle urne. L’obbligo a votare è quindi la soluzione per avvicinare istituzioni e persone?
Sicuramente, l’obbligo di voto è una misura che riduce l’astensionismo, ma allo stesso tempo solleva molti dubbi, perché è necessario risalire alla radice dell’astensionismo, che in molti casi deriva da disinteresse della popolazione, dalla lontananza delle istituzioni dalla quotidianità dei cittadini, o dalla forte delusione per scelte passate.

Non vai a votare? Paghi. Alcuni Paesi hanno deciso così di contrastare il fenomeno dell'astensione. In 22 nazioni votare è obbligatorio e in 11 di queste sanzionano chi non lo fa. In Italia il fenomeno dell'astensione tocca circa il 30%. Negli anni '50 i votanti erano oltre il 90%. Oggi sono poco più del 70%. È giusto obbligare le persone ad andare a votare?

PRIMARIES 2020: Iowa,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
Due settimane fa sono iniziate ufficialmente le affollate e infinite Primarie Democratiche. Il primo stato è come da consuetudine l’Iowa. Se non siete esperti di geografia americana si trova tra l’Illinois (Chicago) e il Nebraska, quindi nel centro nord degli Usa.
La capitale ha un nome che sembra arrivare dalla campagna francese, Des Moines e ha 200 mila abitanti.
Facendo una rapida radiografia con diversi dati si possono capire molte cose:
Anche se i grafici fermano il tempo su certi temi molto importanti, le variabili di voto sono innumerevoli.
L’ultimo sondaggio dava in testaBidenal21%, seguito daSanders,WarreneButtigiegche si attestavano tutti sul16-17%.Il range era così basso che risultava impossibile dire con certezza chi avesse più possibilità di vincere.
Non ha aiutato neanche la modalità di voto, non essendo una semplice primaria con “X” sul candidato, ma un Caucus (una modalità che vi abbiamo spiegato giànel primo articolo).
Nel2016fu una battaglia con percentuali risicatissime.Hillary Clintonvinse con il49,84%controBernie Sanderscon il49,59%.Nel2008invece fu l’incoronazione del giovaneObamache vinse con il37,6%battendoEdwards(29,7%) eHillary(29,4%).
Per questo l’Iowa risulta uno stato molto incerto e che alla vigilia del voto non dava maggior certezza a nessuno dei candidati democratici.
Quindi si può dire che le parole chiavi delIowasono da sempre:incertezza, suspence e trampolino di lancio.","February 19, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/presidential-elections-2020/primaries-2020-iowa/,Norberto Cristofori,thenewglobalorder.com,Presidential Elections 2020
The Von der Leyen Commission: the Plan for a New EU,"By Aurora Ceccotti
In December 2019 Ursula von der Leyen has been unanimously chosen to lead the European Commission. Under the first woman to lead the European Commission, the latter will focus on enhancing gender equality, tackling climate change and augmenting the European Union’s geopolitical role.
Her previous role as defence minister in Germany seems to influence her approach as the appointee in the European commission, planning to invest 30% more in external action and a further 30% investment in development funding and humanitarian aid.
Furthermore, the role of NATO is considered to be beneficial if complemented to the autonomy of the EU defence system, which would stem from further spending on the latter. Several measures have been implemented to increment the geopolitical role of the EU.  The High Representative has now a more prominent role, chairing the Commissioners Group “A Stronger Europe in the World” and a new collegial preparatory body called “The Group for External Coordination”, hence being able to supervise the Commissioners Project Groups and Interservice Groups. This is deemed to increase homogeneity and strategy of the European Union’s external action.
The High Representative will also work closely with the Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement to expand the European external influence, especially in the Western Balkans. Von der Leyen furtherly stressed the importance of external action promising that the latter will be weekly discussed within the College.
As far as concerns gender equality, in order to create a more gender-balanced environment, she selected 12 women out of 27 as EU commissioners and proposed to enhance the ratio of women to 50% in all Cabinets at an administrative level. Furthermore, a “European Green Deal’ is planned to be established, which aims at removing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Investment in green technologies, innovation, research, sustainable solutions, and innovation is in fact considered to have great potential to boost economic growth.

PRIMARIES 2020: New Hampshire & Iowa,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
Non è l’inizio tranquillo che si aspettavano i Democratici con queste Primarie.
Il caos organizzativo dell’Iowa sembrava aver inclinato quasi inevitabilmente questo lungo viaggio.
I cinque giorni per ottenere i risultati, l’incertezza e la mala organizzazione della macchina dei democratici avevano creato malessere e imbarazzo nei candidati e nei militanti. In opposto Trump e il partito repubblicano hanno avuto vita troppo semplice per sbeffeggiare e ridicolizzare l’operato degli avversari.
Tralasciando però il caos, queste due prime votazioni (Iowa e New Hampshire) hanno dato dei primi segnali di quali candidati sono in ascesa e chi invece non riesce a ingranare.
Bernie SandersePete Buttigiegsono ad oggi quelli che se la stanno cavando meglio. Se Sanders era dato come il favorito (per idee, capacità di attrazione, fondi e organizzazione), il Sindaco di South Bend invece è l’under dog di queste primarie.
Moderato e con un’ottima oratoria è riuscito ad attrarre il cosiddetto zoccolo più conservatore nei democratici. La cosa che forse ha stupito di più è l’ottima organizzazione del suo staff che sta lavorando egregiamente partendo da una situazione di quasi sconosciuto (a costo di eresie, un po’ come fece Obama nel lontano 2008).
Chi non si aspettava potesse raggiungere degli ottimi risultati èAmy Klobuchar, altra candidata estremamente moderata, ma che è riuscita a ritagliarsi un posto sul podio in questo inizio.
Difficilmente riuscirà a ottenere la vittoria finale, ma potrà rivelarsi un’ottima sorpresa.
Bè, i nomi sono due:Elizabeth Warren e Joe Biden.
Joe Biden partiva come il vincitore sicuro di queste primarie e da molti suoi discorsi sembrava già in campagna elettorale contro Trump. Peccato abbia dimenticato che prima bisognava vincere le primarie.
Il 15% in Iowa e l’8% in NH sono percentuali assolutamente incomprensibili solo qualche mese fa. Ma c’erano molti segnali premonitori su questi risultati. La poca brillantezza dei suoi discorsi, il non trattare o trattare poco i temi che stanno più a cuore alla base dem, qualche problema organizzativo della macchina elettorale che sembra un po’ vecchia e poco incisiva per questo decennio.
Certamente potrà riprendersi, ma oggi non è più considerato il super favorito.
La Warren invece era considerata la candidata più progressista con Bernie Sanders.
Ottimo curriculum condito con idee estremamente liberali l’avevano portata nei sondaggi a lottare tra i primi posti. Ma i giovani e molte donne hanno preferito chi quelle idee le porta avanti da molto tempo: Bernie Sanders.
Forse quella brutta scena tra loro due durante uno dei ultimi dibattiti prima dell’inizio delle primarie non l’ha sicuramente aiutata, rendendo la sua figura e la sua candidatura sempre più in ombra.
Andrew Yang ha lasciato la corsa.
Ha ottenuto grandissimi risultati considerando che non era né un politico né una persona conosciuta. I suoi temi sono sembrati molto interessanti e, in certi casi, visionari. Il reddito universale per affrontare la disoccupazione che creeranno le macchine è stata forse l’idea più discussa, criticata e apprezzata della sua campagna.
Yang ha fatto sapere che non lascerà la politica, ma aspetterà a dire cosa intende fare.
I rumors dicono che possa candidarsi come prossimo sindaco di New York o entrare in una eventuale amministrazione democratica post Trump.
Il 22 Febbraio si voterà in Nevada, stato dove c’è una forte presenza ispanica e il 29 Febbraio si andrà in South Carolina, dove c’è invece una forte presenza afroamericana.
Saranno interessanti perché sono i primi stati dove l’elettorato democratico non è solamente bianco, quindi si vedrà se Sanders ad esempio è riuscito a recuperare terreno rispetto a quattro anni fa.
In SC è l’ultimo banco di prova per Joe Biden. Se fallirà anche questo appuntamento la sua corsa è praticamente finita.
Per il giovane Buttigieg è ormai tutta una sorpresa. Sarà lui alla fine l’anti Bernie?

The Demise of a Controversial Leader,"This 25th February marked a bittersweet lap for Egyptians. Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak passed away without being held accountable for his actions during the Arab Spring in Egypt, back in 2011.
Egypt is one of the Middle East’s pillars, and as such, has often undergone critical events in order to keep itself stable – while the society has often been the victim of this condition.
In these last decade, the MENA (Middle East, Northern Africa) region saw most of its decades-long rulers fall: Gaddafi, Mubarak, Bouteflika and Al-Bashir, for example. Even though there are those who rebel against tyranny, there are some who need to identify the president as what’s familiar, a strong-man savior, and are willing to indulge his corruption and oppression.
Why did this happen, in the first place?
The origin of the known fierce Middle Eastern nationalism could be, for most of the countries, theBa’ath movement and its evolution from pan-Arabism and its socialist chore. Those were movements for the people, after monarchies or foreign rule had kept them stuck. Then, the leaders came. Who would have thought that Hafez Al-Assad, the father of Bashar Al-Assad, could be considered a hero after he established a totalitarian regime under the Ba’ath’s control?
Those leaders, that were originallyfor the peopleandfrom the people, ended up becoming a paternal figure,  that was doing what was “best” for its citizens: like what was said about Hafez Al-Assad “his wisdom was beyond the comprehension of the average citizen”. That is one of the reasons why leaders in the Arab world tried to remain in power in spite of revolutions and their people suffering from economic and political corruption. That’s the reason why so many people in the Arab world remain with the head down: most for fear, and some because the government, the regime, the system, may be something way bigger than them, that cannot be modified.
Since the Arab Spring began, the estimated deaths have been over 61,000. There are some that still defend the dictators that hardened their co-citizens’ lives, because they need a “leader”, they need “order”, or because they benefit from it. And that’s exactly what some new leaders in the Middle East do: they have to stay in power, at whatever price, because that’s what’s good for the people. The nationalist flag still makes some fall into the trap. It’s just a card game, where people just watch and pay the price while the leaders mostly get away with their crimes,peacefully.

Pro-Justice,"By Janet Kimani
In San Juan Del Riò (México), Dafne McPherson, 29, was released on January 25th, 2019. This was after serving only three years out of her sixteen-year sentence. That’s great, right?Wrong.
Dafne McPherson was sentenced for going through something that women all over the world experience, unfortunately, every single day. A devastating process of pain, physical and emotional, and acute loss. Dafne McPherson was being prosecuted, shamed and punished, for having amiscarriage.
The unfortunate incident occurred at the department store at which she worked where, after suddenly experiencing immense pain, she went into labour and shortly after, had a miscarriage in the bathroom stall. However, not all saw this in the same light. According to the prosecutors, she had murdered her newborn child, an act “not even a dog would do.” The miscarriage was reported under self-induced childbirth, murder (BBC 2019).
In addition, after evidence was produced that she had, in fact, no control over the situation she suffered, she was released, with no compensation for the trauma, pain and injustice she had suffered. Above all, the three years stolen from her seven-year-old daughter, Lia, whose mother was suddenly removed from her life, will never be recovered.
Unfortunately, this is not the only story of its kind.
Latin Americahas seen an uprise of women persecuted for having miscarriages in the name of self-induced delivery with an aim of abortion. In 2014, in Argentina, a woman under the pseudonym Belen was also accused of murder after suffering a miscarriage. In 2016 after spending two years in prison, she was sentenced to eight years for aggravated murder i.e. murder of a relative (independent, 2016).  Similar incidences are on the rise not only in Latin America, but all over the world in countries with brass bound abortion laws, and even in seemingly liberal countries such as the USA. This has led to women who suffer miscarriages being put behind bars, all in the name of upholding the law. There are clear injustices being perpetrated, and little to no reparations to the victims. Unfortunately, there is a slim chance of things improving, given that some countries remain unwilling to either properly invest in a proper investigative process before putting women behind bars, or to simply revise the application of existing laws. This complacency translates into the cycle of blatant injustice being carried forward until like in the case of Dafne,it is too little, too late.
Pro-life or pro-choice, this is simply a question of beingpro-justice!

Does the Government Hide the Victims? First Killed by Coronavirus in Spain Was Not Diagnosed,"By Lucía Ballester Bellver
Many say it is a stronger flu. Others, the global pandemic that will end part of the population, equating it with the black plague. What is certain is that COVID-19, better known as Coronavirus, divides the population and is beginning not only to expand its influence, but also to foment collective hysteria.
As of March 4th, in Valencia (Spain) the first coronavirus victim had died. Surprisingly, it has been discovered at necropsy and the government is being accused of having hidden that it had coronavirus: more alarm, more chaos, more misinformation. One patient, initially diagnosed with pneumonia, died on February 13 from COVID-19, as reported by the Minister of Health, Ana Barceló. This case known through a retrospective investigation, Barceló explained, was detected after the change of criteria for defining cases made by the Ministry of Health on February 27. This change urged a second analysis of deaths due to pneumonia of unknown origin.
It is increasingly alarming to see the amount of media that led to this widespread panic. A big role was played by deceptive and alarmist headlines that, being read by people not very skilled in health and saturated with information, were seen as apocalyptic warnings.
Mortality outside of China is 0.7% and mainly concerns the elderly, between 67 and 90 years old with previous pathologies. But still, we see young healthy and strong people buy dozens of masks (useless for the majority of cases) and leaving pharmacies devoid of antibacterial gel.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Valencian citizens accuse the government of hiding information, although they have claimed that it was a subsequent investigation of a patient who, in principle, only had pneumonia. On the other hand, it is true that the Ministry of Health was already accused at the time of “not knowing” that 2500 Valencians traveled to Milan during the outbreak of coronavirus.

Abdallah Hamdok & Sudan’s Freedom,"Sudan’s Prime Minister, Abdallah Hamdok, survived an assassination attempt in Khartoum this past 9th March. His convoy car was not affected, but the loud blast hit cars nearby, and the leader was able to escape, revealing that he is “safe and in shape”.
Ever since the explosion, he has stated that in spite of the attack to his person, the political liberation path of Sudan will not slow down nor stop – although it is obvious that the way towards democracy in Sudan has its opponents, local and regional.
No group or individual took responsibilityfor the attack, but meanwhile Sudan’s security council is investigating and asking help from friendly countries in order to find the responsible of the attack to the prime minister. It would be no surprise, however, that sympathizers of Al-Bashir’s regime are behind the attack. Shortly after the attack, the state’s prosecutors began investigating who could be behind the attack and arrested some suspects.
The long path of negotiations for democracy in Sudan and the changes in legislation, especiallythose affecting women’s rights, may have angered conservative groups – it’s important to remember that Sudan has been living under an Islamic government for 30 years, and that Al-Bashir counted with allies in several Arab countries and militias inside Sudan.
TheSudanese Professionals Association(SPA), which also lead the anti-Al-Bashir movement, is calling for cohesion and unity for the civilian rule, as now that a threat appeared, it is more important than ever to be united as a people for the common well-being.
The major tasks for Hamdok’s government have been to solve the social and economic issues that the country is facing since Al-Bashir came to power – as well as dealing with Sudan’s rebel groups and reinforcing ties with international governments. The people who have fought for months for peace and a better situation in Sudan must see the results and improvement in their quality of life, knowing thatthere is a way “beyond the military and beyond Al-Bashir”.

Sognando l’Europa: i migranti in trappola fra Grecia e Turchia,"A cura di Vittoria Corrado
Con le loro poche cose, a Edirne centinaia di migranti siriani si sono accampati nella speranza di varcare il confine greco. Tutti loro si trovavano da tempo in territorio turco senza riuscire a trovare un lavoro o a vivere decentemente. Giunti qui per la “straordinaria apertura” delle frontiere da parte di Erdogan hanno trovato schierata la polizia ellenica che ha scagliato contro di loro gas lacrimogeni e cannoni ad acqua.
Ma “indietro non si torna” e chi ci ha provato ha subito un trattamento similare da parte della polizia turca. Si trovano in questo momento dunque letteralmente in trappola, fermi in quel lembo di terra fra due stati ostili che li respingono da ambo le parti.
Il primo effetto collaterale di questo dramma è la“morte prematura” della Convenzione di Ginevradel 1951. In particolare del principio dinon respingimento, secondo cui nessuno può essere deportato, espulso o trasferito verso paesi in cui la sua vita o la sua libertà sono in comprovato pericolo. La decisione della Grecia, con il sostegno dell’Unione europea, è stata infatti quella di sospendere l’accettazione di qualsiasi domanda d’asilo e di respingere tutti quelli che attraversano il confine illegalmente. Il precedente creato è a dir poco pericoloso e si ritiene altamente probabile che in futuro qualsiasi altro stato europeo faccia eco al modello greco.
Ad analizzare i motivi di questa scelta ci si rende conto del grande ruolo giocato del crescentesentimento nazionalista e anti-migratorio ellenico, veicolato ed amplificato dal partito greco di estrema destra Alba Dorata. Quest’ultimo ha da tempo adottato la strategia dei pattugliamenti armati “in caccia di migranti”: il respingimento assume così significato patriottico, atto di difesa della nazione contro l’ondata di migranti islamici e quindi contro l’islamizzazione della Grecia.
Alla luce di questa nuova gravissima crisi, il presidente turco Erdogan è volato a Bruxelles “a batter cassa”. Si è infatti tenuto nei giorni passati un incontro per ridiscutere i termini dell’accordo del 2016 sui migranti, che aveva per un po’ chiuso la questione con la formula dei finanziamenti alla Turchia per contenere l’ondata migratoria. L’incontro ha avuto il prevedibile epilogo di un nulla di fatto, salvo la promessa dell’UE a valutare un impegno reciproco nel proseguo dell’attuazione dell’accordo del 2016.
Il meccanismo di scambio fra accoglienza e denaro sembra esseri inceppato. Al contrario il fiume umano è ripartito e i migranti trovano ad aspettarli e in partenza solo lacrimogeni e bastonate.

The Parasite of Capitalism,"By Francesco Felici
FromParasiteto a parasite, that is how the global focus has shifted in these first months of the nefarious 2020.
At first, the world was amazed by the unprecedented success of this relatively niche Korean movie,Parasiteby Bong Joon-ho. The movie not only won the 72nd edition of the Festival of Cannes, but it also became the first non-english production to win four Oscars, including best film. Not bad I must say. Unfortunately, just weeks later another parasite ramped on into the spotlight, with the breaking of the novel Coronavirus infecting over 200.000 people in the span of just two months, bringing the world into quarantine.
However, these two “parasites” share a similar menacing truth:they inherit flaws of the capitalist systemwhich now more than ever is exposing its true unnatural features.
Indeed, the movieParasiteultimately revolves around the struggle of classes. The director himself claimed that the inspiration for this movie came from his own personal experience. When he was in College, the director recall working for this very rich family as a personal tutor, and he harnessed that feeling of disparity and lust that he felt while working for that family in their luxurious house.
The movie, production of which began in 2015, was initially supposed to be a relatively light-hearted story of a poor family entering this extremely rich environment, sort of like a KoreanFresh Prince of Bel Airpremise. However, as many films by Bong Joon-ho, it ended up being a more grim and drastically realistic take of class disparity.Parasiterevolves around the Kim, an extremely poor family of four who takes on the most demeaning jobs just to get along. Everything changes when, thanks to a mutual friend of Ki-woo (the youngest son), he is introduced to a very wealthy family that needs an English tutor for their daughter, the Park family.
Once Ki-woo is inside, he and the rest of the Kim slowly con their way into the Park family to become their helper and to raise some much needed cash. However, even though at first everything to run smoothly for the Kim’s, tragedy struck when they discover that they are not the only one who are living of the back of the Park’s wealth.  The rest of the plot will not be disclosed here but the only thing left to know is thatParasitehas already become a must-watch among multi-awarded film productions of the decade.
As I stated before, the movie revolves around class struggle. However, Parasite has a subtle way of guiding us audience towards that. Indeed, Bong Joon-ho masterfully crafts all the characters to be relatable albeit flawed.
Our protagonists – the Kim family – are not a pitiful bunch of helpless people who deserve our sympathy; they are con artists who are tricking another family for their own personal gain. On the other hand, the Parks which should be our “antagonists” are not a mustache-twirling villain who frowns upon the poor, they are just a very rich family that. although it a bit disconnected with the reality, are not in any way mean.
Thus, by presenting the characters in this way, we do not have a fully fledged antagonist. We do not have someone to root against, even though we feel that something is wrong and unfair. That is, the ludicrous gap of wealth between the Kim and the Park, and the realization that we cannot blame these people for acting the way they act, for they are molded by their social status. As an audience we feel disturbed watching to what length the Kims are willing to go to in order to save their scheme, as well as realizing how helpless and naïve the Park are in this struggle between classes.
Parasiteshows us that at this point in our history the evolution of capitalism has made it so that inside of society we have acomplete alienation between higher and lower classes, that when brought together act as if they inhabit in different realities.
Now, with the outbreak of the novel Covid-19 this very class disparity may expose the fatal flaw of capitalism.Indeed, the spreading of this virus is nothing short of dreadful. Let us not be fooled by its low-risk of mortality (around 2-3%), because the very risk of this novel Covid-19 relies elsewhere. In the span of just a couple of weeks, the Coronavirus has plunged the stock markets into chaos, and has forced most of the Western nations to issue severe lockdown which will inevitably have ripple effects in the coming year. However, even though the image of stock market losing dozens of percentage points by the day is staggering, the devil lies elsewhere.
Let us take into example theUnited State of America, the front runner of capitalism. At first, president Donald Trump with all of his swagger deemed the threat of Covid-19 as mild, only to close all the boarders with the EU in the span of weeks after many of the predominant federal states such as Massachusetts and New York declared the state of emergency. Now the situation in the US is rapidly turning, similarly to what happened to Italy with the country slowly going into a preemptive lockdown.
However, given the notorious private health care system in America, the situation may well become tragic. If we take into account thatroughly 10% of the American population does not have a healthcare plan, and most of the population holds a very basic one that does not cover hospitalization, and a full day in a hospital without insurance costs around 4000$ per person. Furthermore, if we consider that a scary feature of this Covid-19 is that if a patience suffers of violent symptoms, it requires almost two weeks of hospitalization and severe treatment to defeat the virus, it is easy to see how we have right here a receipt for disaster.
Just to give an example, it speaks volumethe case of Frank Wucinski and his 3-years-old daughter Annabel. They were among the Americans that were flown back from Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic and put into quarantine. Indeed, Mr. Wucinski has lived in China for several years due to his work, but he gladly came back in the US due to the virus. However, after the two weeks of mandatory quarantine, he was surprised with a medical bill of over 3000$, even though they were covered by a low-income healthcare plan calledMedicaid. Not only the Wucinski contacted the town hall to ask for explanation as the quarantine was mandated by the state and received no answer, but later on they received more charges for the ambulance transport and the ex-rays for a total amount of over 7000$. Thus, this case foreshadows how the situation in the US might become more drastic as the virus spreads into the different strata of society.
ThisParasite of Capitalismmay very well be the much needed red flag that is going to awaken people to the inherited flaws of capitalism. When the disparity of class will ultimately lead to sanitary crisis, maybe we will be able to realize what extreme capitalism really entails. When the Kim of the world will face unbearable medical bills to protect their loved ones from this unknown virus, we will see how our system will change and adapt, or breakdown and crumble due to its own unnatural features.

The Economic Implications of Coronavirus:  Financial markets are falling,"By Aurora Ceccotti
The global aggregate bond and stock paper wealth have crashed 25 trillion dollars since the 21st of February and all global gains from stocks and bonds since December 2018 have been erased.
The US is experiencing what Keynes named aliquidity trap, i.e. a condition under which monetary policies result to be inefficient. In a normal condition, for instance, central banks stimulate investment through a reduction of interest rates. Currently, the financial market does not seem to be responsive to such stimulus, as the implementation of quantitative easing and the reduction of rates of interest did not prevent stocks and corporate bonds prices to decrease and yields to increase. In practice, this condition leads tohigher borrowing costs and lower spending.
A further indicator of a liquidity trap condition is theTED spread. It represents the difference between interbank interest rates and 3-month treasury bill interest rate (i.e. the short run government bonds issued by the US government). TED spread and interbank interest rates are directly related; on the other hand, if bonds increase, TED spread decreases.
It is to note that US government bonds are one of the safest assets as the US government cannot default. A sudden increase in the TED level represents a sudden increase in interbank interest rates, suggesting a significant level of perceived credit risk in the economy. A spread above 0.48% indicates a crisis. On the 9th of March, it reached 0.45%.
A sudden increase of TED means that interbank increase, therefore liquidity trap is experienced.
What clearly suggests such a phenomenon is that a high level of spread occurs despite the implementation of expansionary monetary policies by the FED, such as but not limited to an increase in money supply and concession of loans at a low interest rate.
Clearly, monetary policies do not seem to be effective.

L’Europa dov’è (e dov’era)?,"A cura di Milena Di Nenno
Clickhereto read the English version of this article.
Il 21 febbraio 2020 sono stati individuati i primi casi autoctoni di Covid-19 nel nord dell’Italia. Dal quel momento in poi, il numero di casi positivi è cresciuto esponenzialmente, diffondendosi in tutta la penisola, e altrettanto esponenzialmente è cresciuto il sentimento di unità dei cittadini italiani. Tutti uniti contro un ‘nemico’ invisibile. Tutti uniti, perché agli altri non interessa. Chi sono gli altri?
L’Europa.
Quando ci si domandava perché solo l’Italia stesse divenendo il secondo Paese al mondo, dopo la Cina, per numero di casi, la risposta fornita sottolineava quanto il numero di tamponi eseguiti in Italia fosse notevolmente superiore a quello di tutti gli altri stati, europei e non.
Un distacco che ha certamente evidenziato quanto l’approccio degli stati europei non fosse unitario, bensì dipendesse dai diversi governi. Dopo 200 casi positivi e 5 morti in Italia, si è assistito ai primi segni di chiusura degli stati europei nei confronti dell’Italia: l’Austria ha interrotto la circolazione ferroviaria per quattro ore, la Francia ha ipotizzato una chiusura delle frontiere meridionali con l’Italia, la Romania ha stabilito 14 giorni di isolamento per chiunque provenisse dalle regioni italiane colpite.
È così che gli italiani hanno iniziato a percepire un’Europa sempre più distaccata. In questo contesto, si inseriscono le parole di monito del Presidente della Repubblica Italiana, Sergio Mattarella:
“Si attendono quindi, a buon diritto, quanto meno nel comune interesse, iniziative di solidarietà e non mosse che possano ostacolarne l’azione [dell’Italia].”
Evidentemente, le parole ‘comune interesse’ e ‘solidarietà’ sono suonate altisonanti, quando si è assistito a una crescita del numero di casi positivi al Covid-19 anche gli altri stati europei. Il risultato è stato, infatti, opposto: sono stati limitati, dai singoli stati, non solo gli spostamenti di persone, ma anche il commercio, come quello dei dispositivi di protezione personale.
Ad oggi, tutti gli stati europei hanno messo in atto il ‘Modello italiano’ per le misure di contrasto del virus. Ciò sembra aver risvegliato negli italiani la sensazione di non aver bisogno dell’Europa, perché, d’altra parte, è l’Europa ad aver adottato misure che l’Italia aveva sviluppato senza quasi alcun aiuto. Davvero l’Italia non ha bisogno dell’Europa?
È fondamentale distinguere tra l’Europa intesa come l’insieme di stati del continente e l’Unione Europea, un’organizzazione internazionale.
Nel primo caso, alle domande “L’Europa dov’è e dov’era?”, la risposta potrebbe essere: “impegnata a gestire l’emergenza sanitaria a livello nazionale.”
Quando si parla di Unione Europea, invece, il quadro cambia. Sin dagli inizi di marzo, l’UE sta facilitando il dialogo intergovernativo tra gli stati membri, attraverso l’attivazione totale del meccanismo diIntegrated Political Crisis Response(IPCR), il quale prevede la condivisione di informazioni e la stretta collaborazione tra gli stati interessati e le istituzioni europee. L’UE è anche ricorsa ai suoi poteri sovranazionali, stabilendo un piano di azione comune a tutti gli stati membri in ambito di aspetti medici, economia e mobilità. Ha, per questo, stanziato fondi in aiuto dei sistemi sanitari e delle piccole e medie imprese, e fondi di finanziamento alla ricerca su un vaccino. Inoltre, ha annunciato la massima flessibilità sulle decisioni di spesa pubblica e sugli aiuti di Stato e ha ordinato lo sblocco delle esportazioni dei dispositivi di protezione personale all’interno dell’Unione.
Queste decisioni dell’UE sono indirizzate al contrasto di un’emergenza sanitaria che pone sfide importanti non solo ai singoli stati membri, ma anche all’UE come istituzione. L’UE dovrà, infatti, dimostrare, soprattutto ai cittadini europei, che la migliore risposta a una crisi globale è un processo decisionale sovranazionale. Ciò sarà necessario per evitare che ci si domandi “dov’è l’Europa?” e per sostituire l’odierna convinzione di stati e cittadini di poter agire individualmente, con l’affermazione “L’Europa c’è e si vede.”

Where is (and where was) Europe?,"By Milena Di Nenno
Cliccaquiper leggere la versione in Italiano.
On February 21, 2020 the first local Covid-19 cases were identified in the North of Italy. Since then, the number of positive cases has grown exponentially, spreading throughout the peninsula. And, Italian citizens’ sentiment of unity has developed in the same exponential way. All united against an invisible ‘enemy.’ All united, because the others do not show enough interest. Who are the others?
Europe.
The recurring issue was related to the reason why Italy was becoming the second country in the world with the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases. The answer was that the number of tests carried out in Italy was notably higher than in other states, both European and non-European.
Clearly, this gap highlighted thatEuropean states’ approach to the matter was not unitary, but rather depended on the different governments. After 200 positive cases and 5 deaths in Italy, there were the first signs of European states’ closure towards Italy: Austria stopped rail traffic for 4 hours, France suggested to close its Southern borders, Romania established 14-day isolation for those coming from the hit Italian regions.
That is how Italians started to feel that Europe was increasingly detached. In this scenario, the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, delivered his watchwords:
“We are therefore expecting, quite rightly, or at least for the common interest, solidarity initiatives rather than actions that might hinder [Italy’s ones].”
Obviously, the words ‘common interest’ and ‘solidarity’ sounded pretentious, when a growth of Covid-19 positive cases was being experienced also in the other European states. The result was, indeed, the opposite: not only the movement of people, but also trade, like the export of personal protection equipment, was restricted by the single states.
Today, all European states have followed the ‘Italian Pattern’ for measures to counter the virus. This seems to have awakened Italian people’s feeling not to need Europe, because, after all, Europe adopted measures that Italy developed without almost any help. Does Italy really not need Europe?
It is necessary to distinguish between Europe understood as all the states of the continent, and the European Union, an international organization.
In the first instance, to the questions “where is and where was Europe?”, the answer might be: “busy managing the health emergency at national level.”
When, instead, we talk about the European Union, the situation changes. Since the beginning of March, the EU is facilitating the intergovernmental dialogue between member states, through the total activation of theIntegrated Political Crisis Response(IPCR) Mechanism, that guarantees information-sharing and close cooperation among the states involved and European Institutions. The EU also resorted to its supranational powers, by establishing a plan of action common to all member states in the fields of medical aspects, economy and mobility. For this reason, it allocated funds to help the healthcare systems and the small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as funds to finance scientific research on the virus. Moreover, it announced large flexibility on public spending decisions and on State aid and ordered a lifting of restrictions on the exports of personal protection equipment within the Union.
EU decisions are directed to counter a health emergency that poses important challenges not only to single European member states, but also to the EU as an institution. In fact, the EU will have to demonstrate, especially to European citizens, that the best response to global crisis is a supranational decision-making process. It will be necessary to avoid the question “where is Europe?” and to substitute state and citizens’ current belief of being able to act individually, with the statement “Europe is here and I can see it.”

Do Not Forget Africa,"By Francesca Mele
In Horn of Africa, during January and February 2020, locust swarms threatened the livelihood and acres of crops in an emergency condition not seen in 25 years.  During plagues, the crop-devouring insects could affect 20 percent of the Earth’s land; they can fly up to 150 km per day and if the ecological conditions are favourable, locusts can increase about twenty times more in three months.
The first countries affected by the plague wereSomalia, Ethiopia and Kenya: UN’s goal was to stop it before spilling over in other countries and to prevent an humanitarian catastrophe. On 20thJanuary, FAO called for $ 76 million to contrast the outburst of  the crisis and a large contribution came from Germany, which donated €20 million contribution. FAO Director-General QU Dongyu welcomed the contribution but he also highlighted that:
“We are working to curb the locusts’ spread but we also need to safeguard livelihoods and promote early recovery”.
The consequences facing this crisis are that it affects vulnerable regions based on agriculture, considering that a swarm of 40 million locusts can eat in a day the amount of food for 35.000 people.
In February, the swarms moved toDjibouti, Eritrea, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzaniaand some have been detected inYemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan and India. The cost for the required actions amounted to $138 million, half to support the affected communities and half to curb the locusts’ spread. It has to be taken into account that this plague happened in countries extremely vulnerable because of  political, social or economic issues.
At the moment, even if scientists and internal organizations have worked so hard to contain the outbreak, a new factor has been added to this tough African condition: thepandemic of coronavirus.
The previously trade and production shocks due to the infestation have worsened with the demanding measures that coronavirus imposes in the economic and medical field, in addition to impede the meeting of  the technical working groups engaged with the studying of a method to stem the deadly swarm without destroying crops. This dual shock remind us and to the internal community that these countries can’t be abandoned to themselves. Even in this dramatic international moment, don’t forget to behuman.

A Strong Response to a Strong Threat,"By Francesca Mele
While WHO announced the launch of the Solidarity Respond Fund to raise money in order to tackle globally the spread of COVID-19, in some areas of the world facing the virus and its consequences is becoming more and more challenging.
This is the case ofIndia, a huge country with almost 1.4 billion inhabitants with a percentage of the population living below the international poverty line, that is 1.90$ per day, amounting to 21.2% (the percentage was calculated over the period 2007-2017). It means that there is a high likelihood that around 20% of the population might be brutally affected by the spread of the virus. “Stay home, stay safe”, it’s easy to say when people have a roof over their head.
Thebiggest lockdown in the world started on March24thand at the moment it should last for 21 days. In his speech for the announcement of the nationwide lockdown the Prime Minister has recognised that the poor are the most at risk and has reassured that government and civil society are working aiming to provide them with the basic needs; moreover the PM declared that 15.000 million rupees will be invest for strengthening the nation’s health infrastructures making health services the absolute priority.
But only 4 hours in advance before the lockdown entered into force was criticized for theshort notice and thedrastic decisionwhich led to the exodus of day labourers, informal and migrant workers. Like Al Jazeera wrote,
“in capital New Delhi, tens of thousands of people, mostly young male day labourers but also families, fled their homes as the daily-wage earners were effectively put out of work”.
Not everyone can respect the social distancing and the main rule to wash their hands simply because some families do not have running water.
Currently,India has just over 1000 cases, but in the wake of what happened to other countries in Europe, the Prime Minister Modi preferred to take preventive measures even apologising himself for having taken this decision. The pandemic is not going to make distinctions between poor or rich, Hindu or Muslim, citizens or politicians.
Measures are mandatory and the Prime Minister invited the population to “not believe in such rumours and superstitions”, but follow the guidelines given by state  and central government and medical unit. Modi’s responsive decision is certainly a plus point for the country.

PRIMARIES 2020: Bernie ‘Till I Die,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
Bernie Sanders si è ritirato dalla corsa.Fine dei giochi.
Al momento giusto ha lasciato a Biden il compito di battere Trump. Il momento storico e sociale lo imponeva. Il virus aveva bloccato la macchina delle primarie e il voto “via posta” (o con altri metodi) non avrebbe dato lo stesso segnale di sostegno ad un candidato come il voto tradizionale.
Il titolo“Bernie ‘Till I Die”è un omaggio che sento di fare a questa persona e soprattutto alla sua figura politica. Copiato da una serie tv su Netflix che tratta i retroscena, le vicende e la passione di una squadra inglese in un territorio forgiato dallaworking class,ha molte caratteristiche della campagna elettorale fatta da Sanders.
Passione, entusiasmo eUs.
L’ultima, che richiama lo slogan della campagna, “Not Me, Us”,è il simbolo di una carriera che ha visto la politica come qualcosa più interessata alla lotta che al premio. Sanders ha capito che il vero potere politico passa attraverso l’organizzazione dellaworking classe la costruzione di un movimento dal basso. Ecco perché ha passato gli ultimi cinque anni a costruire non solo una campagna, ma una rivoluzione politica.
Medicare for All,Green New Deal,la crescita di diversi sindacati più a sinistra come quello delle Infermiere o quello dei lavoratori nelle Poste, la diffusione di una nuova legge sul salario di un minimo di 15 dollari, la lotta contro le grandi multinazionali (come McDonald’s, Walmart, ecc), l’eliminazione del debito studentesco e pure l’accesso gratuito all’università.
Tutti idee che non verranno abbandonate.
Il merito di Bernie Sanders, come detto prima, è di aver pensato acostruire prima un movimento e poi essere il leader. Cosa che non è per nulla di consuetudine negli Stati Uniti dove le candidature sono da“one man show”e finito il tempo del loro ruolo politico, decade tutto.
La rivoluzione culturale di Sanders invece ha molte eredità: Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib e soprattuttoAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Tutte donne, tutte facenti parte di una minoranza etnica e soprattutto tutte con un’idea di sinistra ben lontana da quello che sono i Democratici americani.
Certamente è una rivoluzione difficile da fare per come è costituita la società americana. Piena di pregiudizi, nemica dell’intervento dello stato nella sfera del singolo, arretrata e contraria ai cambiamenti in molte zone del paese.
Ma le nuove generazioni, quelle dai Millenials alla Z, hanno chiesto un cambiamento. Dove la comunità e lo stato si facciano carico dei problemi sociali che attraversano gli Stati Uniti, dove le discriminazioni per genere, etnia, orientamento sessuale cessino immediatamente e dove il capitale non sia l’unica bussola a guidare l’economia.
“Non me, manoi”
Ma nel cuore le idee diBernie ‘Till I Die.

Covid-19: A Call for Perspective,"By Janet Kimani
In countries that have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic such as Italy, many are comparing the experience to World War II, which took place way before many of us today were born. It would be correct, therefore, to say that for most of us, these are unprecedented times.This pandemic has forced all of us to retreat, to stay put, and to think about how we got here. We have all, collectively as a human race, been stopped dead in our tracks to ponder our lives;the endless mindless rushthat defined our lives and perhaps even led us to this predicament, or at least accelerated its arrival.
Having to stay home, has not been all bad for some. For starters, having a home to retreat to is one. Moreover, many people have received the slowdown they had been craving for so long, to reconnect with themselves and their loved ones. For some, it has been a chance to advance projects they had been putting off for when they had more time, like decluttering, gardening, or even simply watching their favourite shows. All these may seem superficial, but it’s true; from social media, we can see people all over the world finding a sort of peace with having a chance to “take it easy” as they wait for the madness outside their homes to come to an end, after which they can resume normal life.
However, experiencing the lockdown in such a manner is a luxury not everyone has been afforded. As much as this pandemic has shown us the beauty of slowing down through some positive effects on us and our planet, it has also revealed the grisly reality of some of the foundations that underlie our current societies. Predominantly this beast ofglobal inequalitieshas reared its grotesque head for all to see, and demands that we, once and for all, look it in the eyes and face it.
What does “social distancing” mean to someone living in a slum where not even the house itself can maintain the recommended meter distance? What does maintaining a balanced diet mean when you can barely manage a full meal on any day of the week? And what does self quarantine mean when you live in a one-bedroom house with up to six other people, making it impossible to spend endless hours cooped up inside? And how can one wash their hands regularly, when access to clean water remains a pipe dream?
While all these might sound far fetched for those living in more privileged realities, this is the lamentable reality especially in many parts of the developing world; a reality that prevents millions from the luxuries of having productive, restful, or even hopeful moments amidst this pandemic.
So, the next time we post #stayhome, let’s keep in mind those who cannot, be grateful that we can, and think of what we can do to bridge that gap.

The Death of Movie Theaters,"By Francesco Felici
It is fair to acknowledge that the world after the Covid-19 pandemic will change. There will be – at least in the short term – a reshaping of our way of life, and this will have the most repercussions in the social sphere of our interactions.
Indeed, despite the fact that we are all craving a pint in our favorite bar during this excruciating quarantine, it will take a long time before things go back to “normal”, and for some areas they might never will. Today, in my rubric of Cinema and Society, I want to take a look intohow the cinema industry will inevitably be affected, and how this pandemic might sanctionthe death of movie theatres.
Let us start with some considerations.
First of all, movie theatres are not the landmark they used to be, and their social relevance has faded compared to the golden days of Hollywood. That is, both for the ever-growing market of streaming services – which makes it so that many major productions go directly on streaming rather than in theatre – and for a general change in the Cinema market. Before, people flocked to the theatres, eager to see the latest Blockbusters or the hottest stars on display. Nowadays, a remake with CGI lions makes more money (the Disney-funded remake ofThe Lion Kinggrossed over $1.6 billion) than a movie starring Leo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Al Pacino and Kurt Russell ($357.4 milion). It is undeniable that the theatre going experience has changed in the past years, and year after year the movie theatre attendance has steadily declined.
Now, let us add Coronavirus in the picture, by taking a closer look to theInvisible Manby Leigh Wannell and starring Elizabeth Moss. The movie, which is actually an exquisite re-invention of classic Universal monster into a more modern setting that transforms it into a thrilling metaphor for home abuse, was released into theatres right before the pandemic. It spent some weeks in the theatres, and it did actually quite well, but then of course all theatres were closed alongside all the non-essential business. Thus, the movie was moved to an exclusive early access on streaming for $20.
This literally divided the fans, and it is quite easy to see why. If you were planning to watch the movie by yourself, then $20 might be a little too much for just a screening. On the other hand, if you have a household of 4/5 people and you want to watch the movie, there it is your catch. However, at first this was regarded as sort of an unusual move, and the fact that many releases of big-budget production were postponed due to the closing of theatres would seem to suggest that this method was not actually viable.
Nonetheless, now even Disney – the true juggernaut of Cinema – is considering release some of their productions into their newest streaming platform,Disney +. Thus, if the Big Mouse starts to do it, and considering the relative weight and controls that it has over the industry, things might really take a turn.
Personally, I have never been a real fan of movie theatres. Most times, it is just a pretty frustrating experience becausenot all movie audiences watch movies in the same way. Of course, there are sometimes when actually a movie has been enhanced by me watching it in theatres (I will always have Dunkirk) but the cons overweight the pros. Thus, if there were a movie that I just had to watch before it comes out regularly, I would not mind spending $20 to have the experience and maybe make a night out of it with some friends (granted,afterthe end of the quarantine!).
Unfortunately, it is hard to quantify now if this move to the streaming release is fruitful for the studios.
Indeed, they do not have to release the box office numbers as they usually would, which can be a nice double-edged sword in order to prevent the movie that flops from making a big mediatic resonance, while also not giving the chance to push your big hitters. Also, in order to see whether this system works we have towait for some major production to land on streaming. However, given the rumors that movie theaters will likely remain close all the way until the November as a precaution for the virus, and the fact that the big movies that were initially postponed cannot sit on shelves for that long, we might gather the evidence soon.
That will bethe crossroad for the fate of movie theatres. If the revenue appears to be greater with the release in pay-per-view, then given how rootless the cinema industry really is the studios will probably kiss theatres goodbye. Instead, if the profit is not actually that great, we will probably be sold some spiel on how the studios want to protect the movie-going experience and they will fight in order to maintain that balance. All in all, in the coming years everything, from the geopolitical order to even movie theatres will change, and for us that represent the generations who will have to deal with this new global order, it will be one hell of a show.

SOLIDARITÉ EN EUROPE: Faut-il recourir à des Coronabond?,"Par Marta Moretti
Lors du sommet européen du 26 mars, la France, l’Italie et d’autres États membres ont proposé la mutualisation des dettes publiques de la zone euro. Mais l’Allemagne, les Pays-Bas, l’Autriche et d’autres s’y opposent. Quel serà-it- le futur de l’Union Européenne? Est-ce qu’elle existerait encore après cette pandemie mondiale?
C’est l’heure de lasolidarité Européenne.La situation est, comme toujours, très différent entre les pays de l’Union. Il y a les états du Nord avec leur fort économies: par exemple, grâce à l’État, l’Allemagne et l’Autriche ont les moyens économiques d’atténuer une partie des coûts. Par contre, il y a aussi les pays “Méditerranées” avec leur économie plus faible. Il faut trouver un solution pour les états les plus fragiles, afin que nombreux états de l’Union ne doivent pas se retrouver dans une situation similaire à celle de la Grèce en 2008.
LeMES Européennec’est pas suffisant. Cela n’est en revanche pas le cas de certains pays de la zone euro, déjà victimes de la crise économique mondiale. L’Italie, la Grèce e l’Espagne et le Portugal par exemple, devraient très probablement procéder à des dépenses élevées que les gouvernements que ne peuvent pas se permettre. En fait, leur débit public est déjà très élevé et une mauvaise manœuvre financière pourrait compromettre leur économie – déjà faible.
Les pays de la zone euro doivent trouver une solution commune pour sortir de cette terrible crise financière. Le 23 d’Avril, l’Eurogroup se réunira pour décider ce qu’il faut faire.
Quelle décisions vont prendre ils?

[Analisi] Il Politico Celebrità: Analisi di un Fenomeno Moderno,"A cura di Norberto Cristofori
La Celebrità: cos’è?Una famosa frase di Andy Warhol nel 1968 diceva che «in futuro, tutti saranno famosi per quindici minuti.»
Lo spostamento dalla celebrità raggiunta per meriti, esempio accademici, sportivi, per un talento o una capacità in particolare, per la carriera ecc., oggi si è trasformata in celebrità attribuita senza particolari motivi.
La visibilità, un tempo, concretizzava un talento pre-esistente. Per esempio nel caso dei grandi artisti o nei calciatori o sportivi in generale, che sono tali ancor prima che la loro immagine si diffonda nello spazio pubblico. Poi, grazie soprattutto allo sviluppo e alla diffusione prima della televisione e poi dei social media, c’è tutta una categoria di celebrità che sono nate grazie agli strumenti tecnici, per i quali la questione del talento non è più importante.
Pensiamo per esempio ai protagonisti dei reality show, o ai cosiddetti YouTubers, il cui talento è riassumibile nella capacità di trasmettere carisma, simpatia, o bellezza, ma per i qualiil talento specifico gioca un ruolo piuttosto debole. Questo culto delle celebrità moderne è legato al carattere pubblico e diffuso della loro immagine.
Assistiamo perciò a una specie di“democratizzazione della visibilità”,che quindi si accompagna ad una perdita di prestigio. Essere considerate delle celebrità deve essere raro, era questo il caso al tempo dello star system. Oggi, grazie al ruolo di piattaforme e tecnologie, soprattutto dei social media, questa visibilità ha perso una grande parte del suo potere di distinzione.
Il sociologo Karen Sternheimer, ad esempio, parla di un decentramento della produzione di celebrità:mentre in precedenza erano gli studi cinematografici a fare da “responsabili supremi nella creazione di celebrities”, oggi internet e i social media (ad esempio Facebook, YouTube) hanno creato il “fai da te” di celebrità.
D’altra parte, molti di questi mezzi, offrono ai suoi partecipanti un assaggio transitorio di celebrità, ma rimane il fatto che la forza che questi passano alle persone comuni spiana la strada per gruppi ai margini della società e questi si possono realizzare ed essere visibili pubblicamente.
Per questo che molti autori legano il fenomeno che abbiamo legato a YouTube alla parola “democratizzazione”.
La nozione di democratizzazione è in poche parole l’aumentato dell’accesso della gente (comune) alla scalinata verso la celebrità. Per alcuni autori e studiosi però non ha in sé un qualcosa di positivo. Per Turner, sociologo e studioso inglese, la «celebrità rimane un qualcosa di gerarchico ed esclusivo per una categoria, non importa quanto esso prolifera.»
Il fatto che il talento non sia più una condizione necessaria per la celebrità spinge milioni di persone a cercarla. Così da far diventare la celebrità un fine in sé.
Un esempio fu il matrimonio tra il principe di Monaco con l’attrice Grace Kelly, che provocò uno scandalo perché introduceva una categoria sociale sfavorita, all’epoca senza confronto, con il valore sociale della famiglia principesca.
Questa continua ricerca di visibilità, chiamata poi erroneamente democratizzazione della celebrità, è solo un ramo del discorso neoliberista che attraverso programmi di reality in televisione e le celebrità del web contribuiscono alla sua propagazione. Se da un lato i programmi come il Grande Fratello o siti come YouTube sono considerati come luoghi per esprimere sé stessi, dall’altro lato la persona viene trasformata in una nuova forma di merce, che può essere monetizzata e ridotta a un normale prodotto da scambiare.
Per quello che abbiamo detto fino a qua, possiamo constatare che oggi molte persone ricercano sempre più visibilità, dai programmi televisivi ai social, trasformando la loro influenza in lavori alternativi.
Come abbiamo già citato, nuove celebrità come YouTuber o Influencer stanno mettendo in difficoltà lo status sociale e di notorietà delle “celebrities con talento”, che cercano sempre più metodi o strumenti per evitare di uscire dalla scala sociale dello show business.
Uno di questi è sicuramente il processo attraverso il qualela celebrità utilizza sia la sua relativa autonomia come personalità pubblica sia il suo status di celebrità per sviluppare altre attività professionali sia all’interno del loro campo originale o per penetrare in altri campi sociali, che in termini sociologici si chiama “migrazione”.
Esistono due tipologie di “migrazione”: quellainternae quellaesternaal proprio campo.
La migrazione all’interno di un determinato campo si verifica quando la celebrità diversifica le sue attività nel campo in cui essa stessa ha stabilito il suo stato di celebrità.
Questo possiamo notarlo soprattutto nel mondo dei media, dove è fondamentale stabilire una carriera più duratura, sulla base di uno status di celebrità che oggi svanisce molto più velocemente. Questo può essere visto come una risposta alla democratizzazione della celebrità (concetto che abbiamo analizzato sopra).
Questa migrazione interna delle celebrità è un fenomeno che è sempre esistito. Possiamo pensare aOprah Winfrey, ad esempio, una delle più importanti presentatrici americane, che ha recitato in diversi film (ottenendo pure una Nomination agli Oscar), ed è stata anche doppiatrice. Oppure aTom Hanks, due Oscar vinti come miglior attore, è stato anche regista, doppiatore, sceneggiatore e produttore.
L’altro tipo di migrazione è quella esterna, cioè quella che si verifica quandole celebrità forzano l’accesso in un altro campo sociale sfruttando il loro status di celebrità.Negli Stati Uniti, alcune stelle del cinema, per esempio, hanno convertito il loro status di celebrità in potere politico diventando governatori dello stato (Arnold Schwarzenegger) o anche presidente (Ronald Reagan).
Esistono però anche dei limiti per le celebrità per quanto riguarda la migrazione in altri campi sociali, soprattutto se decidono di “invadere” un campo molto fragile e mediatizzato come quello della politica. Mentre se nello sport e nell’intrattenimento una celebrità può fare facili dichiarazioni su alcuni argomenti, ad esempio tifare o fare commenti su una partita di calcio, altri temi hanno bisogno di più credenziali e più attenzione quando questi richiedono un elevato grado di coinvolgimento o conoscenza. In tali casi, non è sufficiente possedere una base di fan come fonte d’alimentazione o qualche legame personale con un politico.
Come tali,le migrazioni non sono un processo senza rischio per le celebrità, perché spesso non è chiaro in che misura il pubblico tollererà questa traslazione.
Parlando sempre di una “invasione” nel campo della politica, negli ultimi anni abbiamo assistito a sempre più figure dell’intrattenimento o celebrità dello sport che cercano di penetrare il mondo della politica, ma dobbiamo sottolineare che tale movimento è possibile anche in senso opposto. Pensiamo a un noto politico italiano come Walter Veltroni, è stato membro e segretario di partito, sindaco di Roma, si è candidato a diventare Presidente del Consiglio, e oggi ha intrapreso la carriera di regista.
Altri politici hanno deciso di migrare in altri campo come diventare membri di Consigli di multinazionali, di società sportive, esperti finanziari, ecc. Questo fenomeno ha generato una nuova forma di celebrità, chiamata“Celebrità Politica”.","May 03, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/il-politico-celebrita-analisi-di-un-fenomeno-moderno/,Norberto Cristofori,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Economic Shocks Do Not Discriminate,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused one of the major economic shocks since World War II. The negative effects of the almost worldwide lockdown are already clear.
The global economy is entering into recession, and, as the economist Rogoff affirms,
if this goes on for a long time, it’s certainly going to be themother of all financial crises.”
All major industries have been suffering notable losses. Among them, theaircraft production sectorand thetravel sectorhave a very uncertain future, because travel ban and restrictions might be lifted last.
The two aircraft suppliers that hold a market duopoly,AirbusandBoeing, have been hurt in the same way, regardless all the disputes between them. Since their establishment, the two have been strongly competing on many aspects: technology development, production outsourcing, sales and exchange rates, and safety and quality. On this last point, we might recall the drastic loss, of around 25 billion of dollars, in Boeing’s 2019 revenue, due to the scandal of the Boeing 737 Max.
The disagreement between Airbus and Boeing became a political concern over the years. Airbus is considered among the greatest achievements of the European Single Market, because it was one of the first companies to take advantage of the common market and to grow thanks to it. Probably, this is also the reason why the European Union feels entitled to protect it with every mean at its disposal. In fact, the World Trade Organization (WTO) accused the EU ofproviding illegal export subsidiesto Airbus.
WTO’s decision followed a failure in bilateral negotiations between the EU and the U.S., having the latter referred to the WTO for EU’s violation of international ban on export subsidies. Export subsidies in the aircraft market are fundamental to shift the excess returns from the foreign to the domestic company. Without subsidies or state aid, the market has two Nash equilibria. If Boeing does not produce, Airbus will profit from the production of aircrafts. When Boeing produces, Airbus will have fewer losses if it does not produce than if it enters the market as well. Of course, in reality, both companies not only must produce and sell to survive, but they also benefit from aids, whether considered illegal or licit.
The whole dispute continues to be inevitablypoliticized, also because retaliatory measures have effects on the rest of the economy. For instance, in October 2019, after the last WTO’s decree blaming both parties for not having complied with previous rulings, the U.S. government imposed $7.5 billion of European goods at large.
With this global health emergency, Airbus and Boeing have been forced to decrease production, as many orders were cancelled, and demand drastically dropped. Because their situation is now a political issue,the two companies expect more measures in their support from the respective government and amical institutions. Boeing has sought a bailout, and Airbus has remarked the urgency of economic aids to airlines and suppliers. This period might be considered as a truce, while waiting for WTO’s ruling in June because that economic shocks do not discriminate. The pandemic has hurt every economic actor indistinctively, and governments’ decisions play an irreplaceable role in reducing the harm.

[Analisi] La Politica D’Intrattenimento: L’Alba del Politico Celebrità,"Nel 2006, in Ohio, Stati Uniti, alcuni dirigenti del Partito Democratico fecero pressioni all’attoreMartin Sheen, protagonista del film cultApocalypse Now, perché si candidasse come senatore. L’attore e attivista americano rifiutò l’incarico, aggiungendo che non era qualificato e che i dirigenti del Partito Democratico stavano confondendo la parola celebrità con quella di credibilità.
In un mondo dove i confini tra celebrità e politica sono sempre più confusi, occorre fare chiarezza su cosa significa veramente “Celebrità Politica”.
Per prima cosa bisogna spiegare a chi ci riferiamo quando parliamo diCelebrity. Questa parola si riferisce aquelle persone che, attraverso i mass media, riescono ad avere una maggiore presenza e una più ampia portata per i loro messaggi o le loro attività rispetto al resto della popolazione.
Possiamo perciò considerarleuna élite di persone, che grazie alle loro capacità o talenti, riescono ad emergere; e utilizzando in modo sapiente la comunicazione e i vari media riescono a mantenere questo loro status.
Questo fenomeno è ben catturato dalconcetto di democrazia del pubblicoche nel corso degli ultimi venti anni circa, lontano dalla democrazia dei partiti tradizionali si è continuato ad evolvere e sviluppare.Il partito politico era al tempo l’attore dominante nel campo della politica,il programma del partito era il principio guida e la competenza la virtù per cui i politici cercavano di coinvolgere e legittimare la loro politica. Invece,ora abbiamo la democrazia del pubblico, in cui le personalità e i singoli sono favoriti sul partito, le prestazioni e le campagne elettorali sul programma e l’autenticità e lo stile rispetto alla competenza.
È vero, come alcuni studiosi sostengono, che c’è stata una certa superficialità sulla scena politica che risale a più di vent’anni. Lo studioso Murray Edelman nel 1964 affermò che ladimensione strumentale della politica veniva gradualmente sostituita da una dimensione drammaturgica e dello spettacolo, mentre gli attori politici utilizzavano non più la competenza come “arma” per convincere i cittadini, ma simboli e rituali per il consumo pubblico attraverso i media.
Non c’è dubbio che questo processo sia stato facilitato dal ruolo sempre più importante svolto dai media nel dibattito politico. Per decenni, gli studiosi hanno sostenuto chei media(prima la televisione e, oggi, Internet)costituiscono la nuova “sfera pubblica”,il luogo in cui le questioni relative alla società in generale vengono discusse ed elaborate.Le notizie politichenei mezzi di informazionesono sempre più “personalizzate“,presentando le questioni come opinioni personali di un singolo politico, tralasciando in un angolo l’impianto ideologico del partito. Allo stesso modo, l’accettazione o il rifiuto di un argomento, tema, idea, proposta politica viene sempre più attribuito alla persona, come singolo, che fa l’argomento piuttosto che al punto di vista ideologico su cui si basa l’argomento.
Come abbiamo visto in precedenza, lo spostamento verso la personalizzazione della politica è aumentato nel corso degli ultimi anni. Oltre a preferire il singolo politico, quindi in una visione sempre più capitalista che premia l’individualità a scapito della comunità, questo fenomeno è accompagnato da un crescentecontrollo sulla vita privata e sugli affari dei politici, piuttosto che sui loro successi e fallimenti istituzionali.
Il Politico Celebrità può essere diviso nei seguenti modi:
1.un politico eletto (o un candidato nominato) che arriva da un campo differente dalla politica, quindi che fa parte del mondo dello spettacolo, del cinema o dello sport. Esempi di questo includono Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan, ecc.
2.un politico o un candidato eletto che usa i modi e gli strumenti della celebrità per migliorare la sua immagine e comunicare il suo messaggio.
Questa forma include diversi sottoinsiemi:
Anche se questi fenomeni sono soprattutto diffusi nei paesi anglo-sassoni, negli ultimi anni hanno cominciato a diffondersi anche in Paesi in via di sviluppo.
Raggiungere lo status di celebrità in altri settori sembra essere quindi un percorso praticabile per aspiranti politici. Ad esempio George Weah, ex calciatore di fama mondiale, dopo varie elezioni, è riuscito a diventare Presidente della Liberia, suo paese di origine.
Perché?
Lo status di celebrità garantisce visibilità e soprattutto familiarità.Conoscere un candidato attraverso la sua presenza nei media può favorire un senso di conoscenza del candidato. Ciò può portare alla creazione di empatia che, se positiva, può promuovere un senso di intimità e fiducia.
Inoltre, le celebrità sono spesso considerate attraenti e gli attori, ad esempio, sono allenati su come trasmettere e comunicare al meglio un messaggio attraverso segnali verbali e non verbali di fronte a una telecamera. Non sorprende quindi che possano fornire prestazioni più convincenti.
Una ricerca fatta sull’ex presidente degli Stati Uniti,Ronald Reagan, spiega, ad esempio, cheil suo successo nei dibattiti politici in televisione era favorito dall’attrattiva fisica e dalla espressività.
Se per il primo gruppo di PC abbiamo colto che è il loro background a favorire la loro ascesa nel mondo della politica, per i politici di professione che diventano celebrità sembra poco chiaro del perché sono aumentati nel corso degli ultimi anni.
Scandali politici e dettagli sulla vita privata dei candidati sono coperti non solo dalle notizie mainstream, ma anche da riviste e spettacoli di gossip.Studi, come quelli di Bless & Schwarz negli anni ’90, hanno dimostrato come l’esposizione agli scandali possa portare ad effetti negativi sia ad effetti positivi.
Le persone che venivano intervistate, quando si ricordavano di politici coinvolti nello scandalo, tendevano a criticare l’intera categoria sociale generale dei politici, ma allo stesso tempo segnalavano un aumento dei livelli di fiducia nei singoli politici, non associati agli scandali.
Certamente queste figure politiche hanno suscitato e suscitano ancor oggi grande curiosità da parte sia dei mass media sia da parte dei cittadini/fan.
Ma questo moto di interesse e attenzione è sempre accompagnato da varie critiche che queste celebrità politiche possono portare all’interno del nostro sistema democratico.
La questione principale èil cambiamento del valore della parola “rappresentatività”, cioè che il PC mina il rapporto tra rappresentante (politico) e rappresentato (cittadino),emarginando le questioni sociali, economiche, politiche a favore di comparse, gesti e apparizioni superficiali.
La preoccupazione è che il banale, cioè lo spettacolo, superi la parte seria, cioè la politica.Postman (1987) già trent’anni fa scriveva che «la politica, come la religione, le notizie, lo sport e l’istruzione sono state tutte trasformate in mere attività di show business.»
Trasformando tutto inentertainment, si deve adattare tutto ai tempi e ai modi dello spettacolo, quindi è difficile affrontare i temi più spinosi in modo più approfondito. Le argomentazioni, i pensieri, le idee e tantomeno le ideologie sono i temi con cui gli elettori decidono se sosterranno un candidato piuttosto che un altro, ma è lo stile, la comunicazione, il modo di porsi e parlare, la capacità di sentirsi a proprio agio in luoghi non affini che portano il cittadino a votare per quella persona.","May 21, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/presidential-elections-2020/la-politica-dintrattenimento-lalba-del-politico-celebrita/,Norberto Cristofori,thenewglobalorder.com,Presidential Elections 2020

"Bosnia, COVID, and Democracy – A Conversation with Una Vaskovic","Just a month ago, Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbàn gave himself full powers in the name of the COVID national emergency in a clear attempt to disband already weakened democratic institutions in his country. In Europe, he is not the only one.
Only 500 kilometers south of Budapest, Željka Cvijanović, president of the Republika Srpska (one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina), declared a national emergency and suspended the regional parliament, feeding many criticisms of anti-democratic political conduct.
TNGO’s Chief Editor interviewed Una Vaskovic, an expatriate Bosnian graduate student of International Affairs who had a first-hand view over the Bosnian government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Giacomo:How was Pres. Cvijanović’s decision to suspend the Parliament perceived? Would you say that there was a solid critical response from other political bodies (the federal government or the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina)?
Una: First, let me try and explain a difference that needs to be made. According to the law of Republic of Srpska there is a difference between the levels of state of emergency. The first one does not include the suspension of the Parliament and redirecting all of the power to Cvijanovic, whereas the second level does.
In anundemocraticcountry such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, it represents a real issue. What is even more worrying is that the two levels of governance, the Presidential body (which is responsible for the entirety of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and the authorities of the two entities, have no correspondence. They act without any common plan on what to do.They are acting as if it is not one country, rather two.
Those who opposed the enactment of state of emergency were the opposition parties, which claimed that the Stage 2 has been enacted just so Cvijanovic can pass all decrees and obtain full control.
Contrary to Republic of Srpska, the second entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina hasdeclared the state of natural calamity. This means that all decisions that are made regarding the COVID-19 are to be passed by the Parliament of FBiH.
Apart from the two entities, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a country has declared a state of emergency, and has formed a Coordination team, that consists of 9 members of Council of Ministers of BiH, 5 representatives of the Government of Republic of Srpska, 5 representatives of the Government of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with 2 members of the Government of Brčko Distrikt BiH.
First of all, this is incredibly confusing. All of the levels of governance and communication are confusing to a Bosnian resident born and raised in the country, let alone to someone who is reading about it from another country.
Second of all, people are not happy with their response. Yes, measurements are somewhat being respected, but the issue, at least in the Republic of Srpska, is thatthe government is not being transparentand is not perceived as trustworthy. As fears of the democratic backsliding rise with Orban’s decision to take absolute control of Hungarian political life, the democracy seemingly stopped existing in Bosnia and Herzegovina a long time ago.
G:Would you say that the public opinion values democratic institutions, or is it neutral? If so, why?
U: Article 2 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina states “Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be a democratic state, which shall operate under the rule of law and with free and democratic elections.”. It is a far cry from that.
The public does values democratic institutions but seems that there is no way to achieve them, and then the people decide to flee to countries that actually have effective democracies. In the recent years, there has been a constant decrease in the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the correct demographic numbers are hard to estimate. Many different sources show many different numbers, all of them are oftentimes considered falsified.
Why would a country falsify its population size?Because it arguably failed.It failed in implementing what it wrote in the Constitution, and to spread falsified information among citizens. I am one of those who left and will not return in a long time, even for a visit, because of how they downgrade people and consider them to be “sheep.” Sadly, not everybody has the financial resources to flee the country like I did.
Many of those who stay ask us, those who left, why did not we stay in the country and fight for what is right. The answer is simple, the corruption is so deeply embodied within every aspect of the authorities and its leaders. This is something that is bigger than one, two, or a hundred people.
There needs to be a bigger involvement of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, EU institutions, UN institutions, international organizations that support democracy, freedom of speech, expression and so on.
In the last two decades there has been a constant degradation of the democratic values and principles that were offered by the institutions, on both the levels of the entity and the country as a whole.
To provide an example of how undemocratic its institutions are; in the last years, a decree was passed by Cvijanovic allowing to prosecute journalist that “spread panic”. But the question is, what does the spread of panic mean? Nothing, it is just a way ofcensoring mediaas much as possible and giving full power to RTRS (public media that is “informally” filled with information on what to report by the leading political party in RS, SNSD.). One cannot imagine that in a democratic country that the censorship of the media would be so blatantly open.
G:International reporters have also stressed the poor quality of the Cvijanović administration’s response to the COVID pandemic. Have you experienced any of the economic measures implemented by Cvijanović?
U:I personally have not experienced any backlash from the economic measures enacted by Zeljka Cvijanovic, since I have not been in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and with that, Republic of Srpska, since April 2018. I have read from some private posts, that seem to be the only relevant and unbiased source of information, that the government in Republic of Sprska has asked people to “donate” a portion of their paycheck to the COVID-19 relief fund. I was baffled by this.
The budget for this year for Republic of Srpska has not been passed and approved, and they are asking the citizens to donate money. It is one of those situations where you cannot believe the audacity that some politicians, or supposed leaders, have.
Unfortunately, people are genuinely scared, and believe that they will be fired if they do not give up half of their minimum wage, which cannot sustain them for a whole month.
G:What is the current condition of the health care system in the Republika Srpska? Is it public, state-funded or mainly privatized?
U: The health care in RS is public and available to everyone. Even if you do not have a health booklet, you do not have to pay that much to receive health care.
However, the system is flawed, and everything can be received through good connections and nepotism.
Hospitals, before the pandemic, needed to stock up, hide, save their equipment such as masks and gloves, because they did not receive enough equipment. If there is a need for more complicated procedure, or treatment, people usually go to Belgrade, Serbia.
Serbia, just next to Bosnia, is in a far better position in regard to the health care system, and their system is already cracking under the pressure of the pandemic.
G:Some Bosnian residents have reportedly lamented having been evicted from their homes to leave room for COVID patients, and afterwards relocated in ill-maintained structures under unsanitary conditions. Do you have any account/experience confirming these claims?
U:Some locals have claimed that the state of emergency can bring this upon them. However, I cannot claim it is a confirmed source since we also need to take into account that information is being falsely spread.
However, if someone came forward with this kind of information, I would not have a hard time of believing in it, and that is a harrowing thing to think about.
We, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are used to the regime that is in place in Bosnia, and their horrendous actions, and that must change.
G:What do you think will be the toughest challenge for the country in the COVID pandemic, feeding the national economy or maintaining democratic institutions?
U: I believe that the COVID pandemic will only deepen issues that are within the country, and that it will show just how broken the system is. The economy is extremely bad, people are poor, there is no democracy, and it will only get worse.
This year will show how Bosnia and Herzegovina failed, over and over, to protect its citizens, and how it is all about the money and power grabbing, without the general concern for its people.
G:Do you have any reading to share with our readers if they want to know more about this situation?
U: My suggestion is to readBalkan Insight, which offers unbiased news in English, and it covers all of the countries of the Balkan. I believe it is a good source of info for people that are not aware of the situation in these countries.
G:Feel free to share any final thought with us!
U:I would ask people to curious about a country of which little is known internationally. The act of asking shows interest, whereas making claims such as doubting its very essence as a state can be hurtful to a people already troubled by internal affairs. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country, a broken one, and it needs help, or to be more accurate, its citizens need help. But the fact that it is a broken country does not make it any less of a country than Italy or Spain.
Furthermore, being from a non-EU country does not make us any less of Europeans. We are often regarded as vile, brutal, uncivilized, uneducated. This is the wrong representation. All of the countries in the Balkans have deep-rooted issues that are constantly being fired up by its politicians, but the people are the ones that suffer from this. You never know what a person’s background is, and what took them to reach a point where they are now.  Making assumptions, that are often wrong, makes us feel isolated and “forgotten”. Be kind and ask questions. Be aware of who you are talking to and be sensitive. People notice that, and it makes us feel accepted and not like we come from a different planet.

Female Genital Mutilation and Improvement in Sudan,"Female Genital Mutilation (FMG) is forbidden in international law. Taking into account “The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence”or also known as Istanbul Convention, article 38 defines and criminalises FMG, intended as:
“a)  excising, infibulating or performing any other mutilation to the whole or any part of a woman’s labia majora, labia minora or clitoris;
b)   coercing or procuring a woman to undergo any of the acts listed in point (a);
c)   inciting, coercing or procuring a girl to undergo any of the acts listed in point (a).”
Maputo Protocol, The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, came into force in 2005 and at article 5prohibits “harmful practices which negatively affect the human rights of women”. Its definition implies States’ responsibility in raising awareness, discouraging the practice and taking all necessary legislative measures to outlaw all forms of female genital mutilation. The article comprises also theprotection of women at risk, who, according to World Health Organization, are estimated to be more than 3 million.
At the United Nations level, the most recent action on the policy area dates back to 2018. The resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council recognized the practice as torture or ill treatment and highlights its equivalence as human rights violence such as the important role played by the States. Indeed the aim is to put an end to the phenomenon by 2030.
Sudan’s outlawing of FGM was enthusiastically greeted by UN’s Children Fund, UNICEF, and now offenders can possibly be imprisoned for three years and fined.More than 80% of women in Sudan aged between 14 and 49 have endured this harmful practiceand its consequence, since has been proved that there are not beneficial results related to health.
The practice assumes different meanings depending on where it is performed, but it is basically, not denying its complexity, a cultural and social practice. This achievement should be celebrated. Nonetheless we should not forget the (at least)27 countries, in the regions of Africa, Asia and Middle East,which still practice female genital mutilation.

Press Freedom in Europe: Only a Fairytale?,"As we face one of the biggest crisis of our era, many of the already existing flaws in our democratic system are dramatically growing. Amongst them, the attacks against press freedom are those which potentially have the power to undermine democracy.
And these attacks arehappening worldwide:United States,Hungary, Philippines, Thailand, are only a few of the countries where killings, intimidation andpolice abuseagainst journalists have been registered. The committee to protect journalists estimated that there arecurrently 250 imprisoned journalistsaround the globe.
Withonly 6 EU countries in the first 10 positionsof the World Press Freedom Index 2020, European States’ reputation does not look good. Several States’ position is barely sufficient in the ranking and the push to censorship we are currently witnessing is helping to bury the EU’s press freedom even further down.
Bulgariagives the worse example, as it has ranked 111 for the third consecutive year, and it has been named ‘’the EU black sheep’’ from the 2020 Reporters without BordersWorld Press Freedom Index. But actions against press freedom are taking place all around us in Europe.
The current COVID-19 crisis has come with many consequences on the media side, fake news and misinformation have a new companion in what has been named ‘’infodemia’’, causingmistrust in health institutions, whileauthoritarian governments are using this confusion to limit press freedomand muzzle journalists.
Butwhy are governments covering up informationand restricting access to data?
The reasons are different, but one is that they are afraid negative publicity for their countries due to the virus and the ways they are handling it could cause repercussions, loss of credibility and, therefore, loss of political power and trust from their citizens.
It is the case inSlovenia, where the government is being accused offorcing journalists to tell the public a ‘governmentally accepted’ side of the story, using social media channels to discredit media which are not reporting what they should according to the government official news, even claiming that media represent themselves a ‘’legacy’’ of communism.
Butpress freedom is constantly under attackalso in those countries considered the most liberal and democratic:Italy, for example, in 2020 stands at position 43 in the World Press Freedom index, with about 20 journalists currently under police protection due to mafia related threats.
InGreece, a presidential decree has put a public broadcaster and a state news agency under direct control of the Prime Minister Mitsotakis.
InFrance, physical attacks and threats to journalists have grown since 2019, while theMaltese scandalconcerning the murder of journalistDaphne Caruana Galiziahas brought, after almost 3 years, to several cases of resignations within the government.
Recently, VP for Values and Transparency at the European CommissionVěra Jourová, who often showed statements in support of media freedom and journalists, talked about these attacks, emphasizing that they will be addressed within the EU Democracy Action Plan 2020-2024, on which consultations are assumed to start by the end of the year.
The Commission’s main concerns seem to be related to thepossible external interferenceon the next European election through content manipulation, artificial intelligence and fake news.
Press freedom is one of the cornerstones of our democracy: its protection concerns all of us.

Cambiamento Climatico: i Rischi Per Il XXI Secolo,"Negli ultimi anni molti studiosi si sono interrogati sui possibili effetti del cambiamento climatico sulla pace e sulla sicurezza umana. Lo stesso Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ha più volte confermato laminaccia del cambiamento climatico su diversi settori, dalla sicurezza idrica e alimentare, ai movimenti migratori, fino allo scoppio di veri e propri conflitti.
Andando infatti ad intaccare risorse fondamentali come acqua o terre fertili, i cambiamenti del clima creano le condizioni ideali per unaviolenta competizione tra gli individui o per la loro migrazione verso aree più produttive, sottoposte in questo modo a forti pressioni. Ecco perché spesso si è parlato dithreat multiplier, proprio per la capacità di amplificare tensioni già esistenti o innescare nuovi scontri in regioni già estremamente vulnerabili.
In questo contesto, è da notare come spesso gli esperti trascurino le micro-dinamiche esistenti: il cambiamento climatico infatti rappresenta unfenomeno multidimensionaleche ha ripercussioni non solo a livello internazionale o statale, ma anche localmente, in particolare sul tessuto comunale, etnico e settario di molti paesi. Esso infatti può innescare forme di conflitto meno organizzate, caratterizzate da bassa intensità ma persistenti nel tempo, spesso indicate come conflitti intercomunali, che sono una conseguenza del cambiamento climatico spesso più plausibile rispetto a guerre su larga scala.
Tali problematiche si presentano chiaramente con maggior violenza in quelle comunità che sono altamente dipendenti da risorse naturali e basano le proprie economie su un’unica attività, come l’agricoltura. Il continente africano ad esempio si ritrova in una posizione estremamente vulnerabile e per questo anche gruppi che prima avevano vissuto relativamente in pace si ritrovano ora a competere ferocemente per l’accaparramento di risorse divenute scarse. Queste dinamiche sono particolarmente evidenti negli scontri che sorgono tra gruppi di pastori nomadi e agricoltori.
InNigeria, ad esempio, si stanno verificando violenti scontri intercomunali che spesso vengono etichettati come dispute etniche o religiose. In realtà, la causa primaria risiede nell’avanzamento di fenomeni di degradazione ambientale, che stanno spingendo i Fulani, tradizionalmente pastori nomadi, a muoversi verso sud, dove i contatti con i contadini e allevatori locali sono causa di violenze.
Anche inKenya, le relazioni tra la tribù del lago Turkana e il gruppo etnico etiope deiDaasanachsi fanno sempre più aspre a causa della scarsità di terre arabili e di risorse idriche. Il lago infatti, primaria fonte di sostentamento, si sta gradualmente prosciugando: causa l’avanzare della desertificazione e i progetti infrastrutturali intrapresi dall’Etiopia. Infine, persino la crisi del Darfur, di cui da sempre sono stati evidenziati esclusivamente gli elementi razziali ed etnici, sembrerebbe essere scaturita da una grave siccità e da profondi mutamenti ecologici.
Occorre quindi rafforzare la conoscenza dei rischi legati al clima e sviluppare una maggiore sensibilità nei confronti dei conflitti intercomunali, la cui minaccia appare estremamente chiara. Vista la loro enorme potenzialità di minare la pace e la stabilità di interi paesi, è vitale che non vengano ulteriormente trascurati.

2020: Anno di Svolta Per la Somalia,"Il 2020 potrebbe essere un anno fondamentale per la Somalia, che dopo decenni di instabilità ha la possibilità di iniziare un nuovo cammino.
Recentemente infatti, glisforzi finanziarifatti dal paese sono stati riconosciuti, aprendo la strada a nuove risorse e a cambiamenti importanti in materia di economia, sviluppo e stabilità. Grazie a finanziamenti ponte di Italia, Norvegia, Regno Unito e un contributo dell’ Unione Europea, gli arretrati del paese alla Banca africana di sviluppo (AfDB), al Fondo Monetario Internazionale (IMF) e all’Agenzia Internazionale per lo sviluppo (IDA) sono stati liquidati.
In questo modo, nell’ambito dell’iniziativa HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries), la Somalia è stata finalmente ritenutapronta a ricevere una riduzione del suo debito, diventando il 37° paese a raggiungere il traguardo noto come ‘HIPC Decision Point‘. A questo è seguita inoltre la decisione dei paesi creditori del Club di Parigi di cancellare 1.4 miliardi di dollari del debito del paese, che in cambio attuerà nuove riforme volte a stimolare la crescita economica.
È importante inoltre ricordare che questo sarà anche l’anno delleprime elezioni democratiche somale dal 1969, per cui da un sistema basato sui clan si passerà al suffragio universale, aprendo la strada ad una più estesa partecipazione politica popolare. Tali eventi rappresentano un test cruciale per il paese che ha finalmente l’opportunità di rimettersi in piedi e di affrontare le numerose problematiche interne che l’affliggono.
Necessari sono sicuramente nuovi piani di sviluppo, i quali comprendano anche lalotta al cambiamento climatico, che ha duramente colpito il Corno d’Africa, come le recenti carestie, siccità ed invasioni di locuste hanno dimostrato. Fondamentale è inoltre offriremigliori condizioni socialialla popolazione, afflitta da un’estrema povertà e una dilagante disoccupazione, soprattutto a livello giovanile.
Altra priorità è lalotta al persistente terrorismo di Al-Shabaab, che, a causa del diffuso malcontento sociale, ha tutt’oggi una considerevole presa sui più vulnerabili. Ecco perché il settore della sicurezza deve essere rivisto e reso più efficace, soprattutto adesso che l’AMISOM è impegnata nel graduale ritiro delle sue truppe dal paese e che entro il 2021 le forze somale dovrebbero prendere la guida.
Mogadiscio si trova quindi in un momento cruciale, in una fase di svolta, da cui per uscirne vincenti è necessario rafforzare le relazioni tra gli stati federali somali, ma anche quelle bilaterali con i paesi vicini, come il Kenya e promuovere una solida cooperazione regionale, con l’aiuto dell’Unione Africana e delle Nazioni Unite.
• La cancellazione del debito del paese offrirà veramente nuove opportunità?• Le prossime elezioni somale saranno in grado di portare reali cambiamenti nel panorama politico?• Tali cambiamenti riusciranno a minare il supporto per Al-Shabaab nel paese?

COVID-19 e Stato di Diritto:  Italia e Ungheria a Confronto,"Nel contesto della crisi sanitaria da COVID-19, l’opposizione ha accusato il Governo Conte di non aver coinvolto il Parlamento nell’emanazione dei numerosi DPCM adottati da Palazzo Chigi. In particolare, Giorgia Meloni ha accusato il Presidente del Consigliodi aver sospeso, in questo modo,la Costituzione.
Si tratta di un’accusa importante: un Governo con maggiori poteri, seppure resi necessari dallo stato di emergenza dovuto all’epidemia, rischia di diventare un Governo pericoloso, se tali poteri non risultano circoscritti entro precisi limiti.
Vale allora la pena analizzare brevemente ladisciplina dello stato di emergenzaall’interno dell’ordinamento Italiano. Lo stato di emergenza non è menzionato direttamente dalla nostra Costituzione, che al più fa riferimento allo‘stato di guerra’ex art. 78 Cost. come presupposto per conferire al Governo i poteri necessari per farvi fronte.
Lostato di emergenzaè invece stato disciplinato con lalegge 225/1992, che istituisce il Servizio Nazionale della Protezione Civile. Per dichiarare lo stato di emergenza, è necessario:
“Ogni cittadino può circolare e soggiornare liberamente in qualsiasi parte del territorio nazionale, salvo le limitazioni che la legge stabilisce in via generale per motivi di sanità o di sicurezza. Nessuna restrizione può essere determinata da ragioni politiche.“;
Vista la disciplina, conviene sottolineare comeci troviamo di fronte a poteri tutt’altro che ‘assoluti’: l’autorità competente può adottare misure restrittive delle libertà dei cittadini solamente in quanto strettamente funzionali al contenimento dell’epidemia. Inoltre, solamente il riconoscimento di tale poterea tempo indeterminatoe un suo utilizzoal di fuori di tale scopone determinerebbe l’illegittimità: con questi limiti, invece, si garantisce il paese contro un colpo di stato.
Simili limiti sembrano mancare invece,tra gli altri paesi, in Ungheria.
Il 30 marzo scorso, il Parlamento Ungherese ha approvato una legge con cui conferisce all’Esecutivo diViktor Orbándi governare per decreti a tempo indeterminato e senza possibilità per il Parlamento stesso di effettuare controlli su quanto deciso.
La legge prevede inoltre che chiunque violi le misure predisposte al contenimento del virus, o diffonda informazioni false o distorte sul virus o sulle misure per contrastarlo potrà subire unacondanna fino a 5 anni di carcere. Tali misure appaiono sproporzionate dal punto di vista della pena e poco strumentali rispetto alle finalità di contenimento dell’epidemia: risultano, invece,  particolarmente utili per mettere a tacere dissensi e critiche rispetto alle decisioni del Governo.
Questa legge è stata fortementecriticata dalle opposizionie vista contimoredalle istituzioni europee e le organizzazioni internazionali. La Segretaria Generale del Consiglio d’EuropaMarija Pejčinović Burićha indirizzato una lettera al Primo Ministro Orbán, sottolineando come le misure emergenziali debbano essere in linea con gli standard internazionali previsti per la protezione dei diritti umani.
Difatti, uno stato di emergenza ‘incontrollato’ non sarebbe in grado di garantire una protezione dei diritti dei cittadini contro eventuali abusi di potere. Inoltre, il dibattito in Parlamento e sui media così come l’accesso a documenti ufficiali figurano quali elementi essenziali di ogni ordinamento democratico, al fine di assicurare fiducia e sicurezza all’interno della società in situazioni delicate come la crisi da COVID-19.
Dopo più due mesi, proprio martedì 16 giugnoil Parlamento Ungherese ha revocato lo stato di emergenzache conferiva a Orbán pieni poteri. Tuttavia, si è lasciata la possibilità al Primo Ministro di dichiarare un nuovo ‘stato di pericolo’ in vista di una seconda ondata dell’epidemia. In tal caso, il suo Esecutivo potrebbe ancora una volta legiferare per decreto.
Secondo organizzazioni non governative come Amnesty International Ungheria,questa legge non toglie nessun potere di fatto a Orbán, che potrà continuare ad emettere nuovi decreti senza però, questa volta, doversi basare su uno stato di emergenza dichiarato dal Parlamento. Durante l’epidemia, l’Esecutivo Orbán ha adottatopiù di 100 decreti, molti dei quali non difficilmente risultano strumentali al contenimento dell’epidemia: tra tutti, il decreto che vieta il cambio legale di sesso per le persone transgender, limitando il diritto all’identità di genere.
In conclusione, le libertà fondamentali, specie in situazioni di emergenza, possono essere limitate legittimamente in ragione di uninteresse collettivo superiore, come la sanità pubblica e la sicurezza. Nel momento in cui i diritti umani vengono sacrificati senza una ragione che sia strumentale alla loro stessa protezione, ci si trova dinanzi a un pericoloso scenario: quello in cuii diritti dei cittadini sono alla mercé di un solo organo, l’Esecutivo. Uno scenario che non sembra molto lontano dalla realtà quando si parla dell’Ungheria.

"A Battle for Supremacy, But At What Cost?","Since the economic reforms adopted by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, China has rapidly developed from a country based on a rural economy intothe world’s second greatest economic power, just behind the United States.
As the Trade War has demonstrated, Donald Trump is carrying out a foreign policy based on a growing sense of rivalry between the United States and China. According to President Trump, China benefits by violating the rules of the WTO, enabling unfair trade practices and causing the economic conflict between the two countries. However, the most recent twist in the China-US relationship should be taken into consideration.Donald Trump has recently suspended US funding to the World Health Organization, accusing the body of mismanaging the COVID-19 crisis and covering up the outbreak of the virus in collaboration with China. In fact, in his view, WHO appeared to be too China-centric in its approach.
Beingthe largest single contributor to the body’s budget, nearly $400m per annum, the US has the right to investigate how WHO is allocating its resources, and the organisation has been largely criticised for the way it has handled previous health crises, such as Ebola. Then, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 12th, when several thousands of people had already died from the virus across the globe. On the other side, Mr. Trump, has also been accused of underestimating the infection rate of the virus, hoping it would disappear‘like a miracle’. All of these considerations may or may not be accurate, and one could easily argue for one side or the other.
However, the current situation should not be the opportunity for another US-China geopolitical battle. Suspending US funding to WHO in the middle of a pandemic drastically weakens the effectiveness of the organization’s response to the virus outbreak. As the Secretary-General of the UN remarked,this is the time to support humanitarian organisations extensively, not to undermine their operations. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has tried several ways to blame China for the virus outbreak; he accused the country of hiding the virus from the world, and then of creating it in a lab.
If COVID-19 represents an opportunity to challenge China in the US agenda,is the risk of poorly handling the world’s fight against the virus worth taking?
• What does the WHO concretely do?• What are the risks of the US-China war in a health crisis?• What can we do, as individuals, to contain the spread of the virus apart from practising social distancing?

Can the Coronavirus Cause a Political Conflict Between China And The United States?,"Currently, the Us is accusing China of having caused the Coronavirus crisis that is now shaking America. Although, the enmity between China and the US is always been evident,their relationship is increasingly deteriorating.
The rise of China in the international scene, is perceived like a threat for America. From the moment in which China integrated the capitalism model, its economy has grown from the point of erasing the economic influence of the US. Nowadays, the US leads the GDP ranking; however, when one analyses countries based on their Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), China is at the top of the ranking, followed by the US.Globalization drove to the rise of new powers and, in turn, to the relative decline of American hegemony and therefore, the crash between China and the US was arguably predictable.
In addition, China is the strongest economy in theBRICS, a Reserve Fund formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa and its contributions account for almost three quarters of the group’s international reserves, more than 60% of foreign trades, in order to provide greater political autonomy to their members and not depend on American funding (Ríos, 2017). Furthermore, China is allied with countries like Venezuela, Sudan, and Iran from which its oil supplies are bought. This clearly worsens the relationship between the two super powers.
The rivalry was already visible in the economic war that Trump undertook againstXi Jinping, in 2018. This had a negative impact on the Chinese economy due to its dependency on the export of manufactured products, hence on foreign countries. However, these actions could have slowly dragged global economic activity into a slowdown and perhaps, many analysts pointed out, into a recession (Orgaz, 2019).An agreement was therefore needed and inevitable,and it was reached in this January, with the presidential elections close at hand.
Nonetheless, the COVID-19 situation is a game changer. At the beginning of April, the Intelligence Services of the US concluded that the Chinese Government has hidden the real scope of the outbreak of COVID-19, in other words, the real number of deaths was hidden, meaning that the threat of the virus could have been even greater that the one that China displayed. In addition, Donald Trump has questioned the death figures of China and in a meeting of the White House, few weeks ago, he has confirmed that if China has lied about the information of the COVID-19, there would be consequences. The attacks became sovereignist as well, because of the nationalization of the name of the virus itself, also in the President’s twitter account where he calls it “the Chinese virus”.
The American situation is even worse that what was expected and Trump’s Administration actions have proven ineffective, both due toCOVID-19’s viral loadof COVID-19, as well as for a matter of underestimation of the possible pandemic. In addition, incriminating and stigmatized comments are frequent among American politicians: the last one, coming from a South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham who accused China of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans.
In the in theworst-case scenario, the relationships between China and US could deteriorate throughout the course of the pandemic and return to an even greater commercial war. Perhaps, the US would only try to use China as a scapegoat on its domestic policy, because of thepresidential elections being in Novemberand the current scenario of America not guaranteeing the re-election of Donald Trump.
The course of the pandemic will determine the relationship between the two powers however, fairness is necessary and pointing and campaigning against China may hide the mistakes made by the current American Administration. There is no doubt that the international scene needs the American and Chinese governments to work together to stem the tide of the pandemic and set aside its disagreements.

Saudi Arabia: Between Reforms and Repression,"On the 27th April 2020,  Saudi Arabia abolished thedeath penaltyfor minors. The Gulf country, according to data provided by Amnesty International, ranked third in the list of states with the most death sentences executed in 2019, behind only China and Iran.
In the Saudi State, the death penalty is applied through a rigid version of Shari’a deriving from the Wahhabi conception of Islam widespread in Saudi Arabia, one of the most conservative and extremist forms of the Muslim faith. The death penalty isinflicted against crimes such as rape and murder, butalso against homosexuality(considered a crime in the Saudi kingdom) andapostasy.
This measure is part of a broader plan to modernise the country, devised by Crown PrinceMohammad bin Salman, the country’s strong man and current Defence Minister, known internationally by the acronym MBS.
In 2016 he launched the“Saudi Vision 2030” plan: an ambitious project aiming to bring the Saudi Kingdom tomodernity, andfreedom from its dependence on the oil industry. It further plans to invest important resources in other sectors, such as tourism, renewable energy and public assistance, but also foresees a substantial increase in the funds allocated to armaments.
Themodernization processis also directed at Saudi society; for example, from 2018, women are allowed to drive and participate as an audience member in sporting events. However, these measures contribute only fractionally to solving the very serious gender gap issue in Saudi Arabia.
The prevailing aim of these measures is toclean up the country’s image in the Western media, and make Saudi Arabia more attractive to investors and tourists; an image which, however, continues to be polluted by increasingly mysterious news stories. From the Khasshoggi case, the Saudi journalist killed in his country’s embassy in Istanbul, to the recent arrest of three members of the royal family, among whom accused of treason includes the former Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef; over both cases hovers the figure of MBS, committed to getting rid of opponents and competitors.
Saudi Arabia today seems to betorn by great contradictions, from facade reforms to an increasingly consolidated regime on the figure of MBS.

"The Four-Day Working Week: Pros, Cons, and Potential Realisation","In recent news, New Zealand Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has floated the idea of a four-day working week, replacing the traditional five-day 40-hour week. In this article, I wanted to explore thepositives and negatives of this potential new work-lifestyle. Luckily, there have been many studies done into this practice: in the 2019 UK electoral campaign, Labour proposed the idea in its manifesto, in New Zealand there have been multiple companies that have taken on the proposal, most famously the company Perpetual Guardian, and in the Netherlands one municipality has fully enforced it.
In the 8-week experiment by Perpetual Guardian,the results were largely positive; the 240 employees would choose one day a week to take off but continue to be paid for a five-day week. The company reported6-12.5% increases in revenue and profitability, happier staff, and stress levels decreasing. Now the company’s founder, Andrew Barnes, experiment has interested New Zealand’s prime minister to consider the four-day working week as one way to rebuild the country’s domestic tourism industry following Covid-19.
Websites advocating and marketing four-day work week careers list numerous social positives, including:environmental benefitsdue to less time commuting (a top cause of traffic pollution) and reductions of energy usage in offices. The reduction of work hours has also been advocated as a means toreduce the gender pay gap: the redistribution of paid and unpaid work would occur as two working parents could both contribute a full day of childcare.
There could also be potentialeconomic benefits; workers with more free time would have more opportunities to seek out leisure activities – going to a café, to a restaurant, going shopping etc, meaning more money would be invested back into the economy. If companies were also reporting increases in profitability and revenue, such as Perpetual Guardian, it is easy to see why the idea is appealing. Last but not least, experiments reported lower levels of staff sickness and stress:staff stress levels decreased from 45% to 38% whereas in 2017/18, 15.4 million working days in the UK were lost due to work-related stress.
In the UK, Labour’s manifesto proposal was a response to the high percentage (WIRED: 63%) of Britons wanting a four-day working week. The political party’s proposal was backed by a study by economic historian Lord Robert Skideslky, who supported the idea but did report negatives. He warned againstworkplace exhaustion, arguing the reduced amount of hours could cause increased stress to get work done quicker, which is an issue Perpetual Guardian reported in one of its teams.  He also warned againstthe negative impact a nationally enforced four-day work week could have on unskilled and zero-hour workerswho depend on the hours they work for their wages, and where the work does not depend on mental productivity as much as physical presence. It is clear that, despite promising experiments in companies with relatively low staff numbers, the proposal of a four-day working week will need to be considered separately for every industry and every workforce;the way forward would not be a blanket enforcementif it meant certain industries would not work this way.
Skidelsky also raised the concern of a‘new dualism’in the workplace if said negative impact were considered; only some companies  would be able to afford free time for their employees. In the name of market competition there is the potential that other companies, of which some of whom already push against the boundaries of workers’ rights, couldbring on a new horizon of unpredictable and longer work hoursto the sectors that would not function with blanket shorter hours. It is certain thatany fundamental change to the workplace would bring on many new uncertainties and potentials for concern, which would need to be weighed fairly against its benefits.
One question proposed by WIRED was:• “Is it a promised utopia; or the suppression of the right to work?”
To which it could be asked:• Would there be a fair way to apply this policy to certain industries, without creating ‘new dualism’?• Could the renewed perspective Covid-19 has brought to many worker’s work-life balance, and self-defined working hours be the catalyst for a change in working hours?

Lessons from Senegal: Experience and Innovation,"Senegal, a small West African country, isleading by example through its impressive innovation amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Having been badly hit by Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and Dengue fever in the past, Senegal has proven it has learnt the lessons from these experiences which are so useful in the current situation. A laboratory in Senegal is currently utilising its experience in handling infectious diseases by developing $1 USD testing kits, enabling it to do what no other country has been able to do:test everyone in the country who goes to the Covid-19 testing centre, symptomatic or not.
The testing kits are an innovation borrowed from those used during the Dengue fever outbreak, a mosquito borne viral disease. Additionally,Senegalese engineers have manufactured innovative ventilators using 3D printing machines whose price is $60 USD, a fraction of the $16,000 USD imported alternatives. Through its innovations, Senegal has been able to deal with Covid-19 relatively successfully, in terms of the number of related fatalities and recoveries. Senegal has reported 25 deaths out of the 2,428 infected since the outbreak, out of which 949 have so far recovered. Senegal is thusimpressively outperforming larger economies such as the United Statesin its handling of the virus.
Despite its relatively small budget, upon approval Senegal further hopes to develop testing kits and ventilators to help its fellow African countries, many of whom are also unable to afford the pricier internationally-imported equipment. Senegal is thus proving that the solution doesn’t always have to come from outside.With the right innovation, coupled with relentless determination, countries can use the little they have to battle Covid-19 from within their borders.

Raid in the West Bank: Palestinian Teen Killed by Israeli Army,"On the 13th May,Zaid Fadl Qaisia,a 15-year old teenager,wasmurderedin a raid held by the Israeli forces in the West Bank.  Four further minors were shot. The raid was aimed at arresting the adolescent, who was accused of having insulted an Israeli soldier on Facebook; the supervision of Palestinians through Facebook is one of the milder ways through which the Israeli government maintains control and surveillance over its public.
Not only the West Bank, but also Gaza and East Jerusalem have been exploited as experiment fields to test and develop new tools of digital surveillance.The Israeli company Mer Security, founded in 1948 as a metal workshop, has now focused its security division on exporting surveillance products. One of the products developed by the firm is the Strategic Actionable Intelligence Platform (SAIP), which enables the user to create an avatar in order to collect data from closed forums. Similarly,the Israeli Police are suspected of having used fake Facebook profiles to monitor Palestinians and other targets of investigations.
Israel is well known to be a globally prominent figure in the surveillance industry, having technology as a central industry sector in its economy.In 2014, 6 billion dollars worth of products and services have been exported by the MER Group. The close connection between private firms such as the group and the Israeli intelligence, such asUnit 8200, is not surprising. The skills of cyber-espionage gained in Unit 8200 are applied by veterans in one of the 27 private surveillance companies in Israel.
Digital technology does not have an evil nature, per se, nor benign. However, if used for political purposes, specifically for maintaining control over people through denying their freedom, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence assume a negative connotation, becoming athreat to democracy and human rights.It is now urgent that werenovatecurrent domestic and international policies in order to enhance digital technology’s potential to ameliorate human life and prevent the further violation of human rights.

Se la democrazia non è altro che la legittimazione dalla forma di comunicazione di maggior successo, alloral’artista della comunicazioneè il migliore democratico, senza alcuno sforzo.
Partendo da questa frase è facile presentare il secondo genere di Celebrity Politica. È un fenomeno che soprattutto negli Stati Uniti, e in genere nei paesi anglo-sassoni, si è sviluppato.
Si riferisce a unacelebrità che si pronuncia sulla politicae rivendica il diritto di rappresentare popoli e cause, ma che lo fa senza cercare o volere cariche elettive. Il loro impegno tende a prendere la forma in gesti pubblici o in dichiarazioni volte a modificare le decisioni di specifici temi di natura pubblica.
Queste persone utilizzano il loro status, la loro figura, come mezzo per parlare di cause, problemi e interessi particolari, come ad esempio cause ambientali, umanitarie, fatti di discriminazione razziale, di genere o di xenofobia.
Ma perché le loro parole possono influenzare i risultati o avere maggiore risalto rispetto ad altre opinioni?
I media trovano più affascinante riuscire a mettere in contrapposizione l’opinione di una celebrità a quella di un politico, soprattutto se l’attore, lo sportivo, ecc ha una grande pletora di fan.
Ed è questo rapporto (tra celebrità e fans) che costituisce la base del successo di questo fenomeno.
In una ricerca del 1995 John Thompson, antropologo, ha sostenuto che essere un fan è un importante caratteristica della modernità. Essa comporta la formazione di relazioni di intimità con altre persone lontane, e questo può essere visto come la base di una forma di rappresentanza.
La ricerca psicologica inoltre ci può aiutare meglio a capire questo fenomeno. Gli esperti di marketing hanno da tempo capito che associare un prodotto a una celebrità che piace o che abbia una grande base di persone, che possono definirsi sue fan, aumenta le vendite del prodotto attraverso una serie di processi psicologici. Ad esempio, secondo il modello sistematico di persuasione (Chaiken, 1989), “gradire” la persona che fornisce il messaggio persuasivo induce un’elaborazione euristica piuttosto che sistematica del suo contenuto.Le qualità attribuite alla celebrità, che possono essere la simpatia, la bellezza, l’affidabilità, possono trasferirsi al prodotto.Si può obiettare che certe tematiche o idee potrebbero essere offensive se considerate una “marca” o un “prodotto”, ma l’obbiettivo finale è che il messaggio di fondo passi a più persone possibile.
Le maggiori criticheche vengono mosse verso queste persone è il motivo per cui un cittadino dovrebbe ascoltare degli attori o sportivi che ci parlando di medicina o di gravi problemi ambientali.Le celebrità non hanno la conoscenza, o la competenza in politica pubblica:«i gravi problemi politici diventano banali nel tentativo di elevare le celebrità in filosofi»
L’agenda politica di una nazione non può essere portata avanti da queste persone, perché queste preferiscono prendere parte a discussioni su questioni che interessano soprattutto alle persone più benestanti (e quindi che fanno parte di una piccola fetta della popolazione) e tralasciare il discorso su più pressanti e gravi problemi sociali.
In sintesi,la politica delle celebrity rischia di far fare un cortocircuito alla democrazia, mettendo in pericolo il sistema di responsabilità e rappresentatività.
L’altra critica maggiore della politica delle Celebrities è quella riguardante l’eccessivaattenzione dell’apparenza, che comporta una inadeguata valutazione dei rappresentanti. Come abbiamo citato prima, molti studiosi sostengono che i rappresentanti politici dovrebbero essere giudicati in termini di qualità delle loro proposte politiche, la coerenza di idee legate al loro gruppo politico o partito, e la legittimità della loro candidatura nelle procedure di selezione all’interno del loro partito o movimento.
Brennan e Hamlin scrivono (2000):«Sarebbe perfettamente razionale (in senso stretto) votare in base all’apparenza del candidato o alla sua voce se quelle sono le caratteristiche con cui l’elettore si identifica di più.»
Questi due autori sostengono che “l’apparenza” ha un posto legittimo all’interno nel rapporto tra rappresentante e rappresentato.
Il voto deve essere visto come un atto espressivo, e non come un atto strumentale diretto per risultati politici specifici.Come atto espressivo, il voto viene visto come un permettere all’elettore di identificarsi con i politici e di cercare ciò che (gli elettori) trovano politicamente attraente.
Il carattere e le competenze, secondo Brennan e Hamlin, sono la base più tipica per la valutazione.La coerenza politica, ideologica o l’abilità politica non sono più valori che suscitano nei cittadini un motivo in cui identificarsi e votare.","June 09, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analisi-attivismo-delle-celebrity-tra-diritti-e-problemi-di-rappresentativita/,Norberto Cristofori,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"[Analisi] La Democrazia Ammalata: tra celebrità, movimenti e la teoria del Giovane Cittadino.","Per prendere in considerazione il ruolo della celebrità politica nel nostro tempo, bisogna prima considerare che oggi viviamo in un periodo caratterizzato da una crescente complessità e da una maggiore riflessività che si riflette nei cambiamenti economici, socio-culturale e politici.
Il concetto di Bang, ripreso da Marsh, T’hart e Tindall (2016), vede l’attuale stato della politicacaratterizzata da diversi punti:un maggior potere dato al governo; lo svuotamento dello stato; la perdita di potere e del ruolo centrale dei partiti; il cambiamento delle forme di partecipazione politica e l’aumento del dualismo media e celebrità politica.
Se per i primi punti possiamo pensare che il cambiamento è dato soprattutto a motivi strettamente strutturali e politici, gli ultimi due sono più legati al nuovo ruolo che è stato dato alla comunicazione e alla introduzione di internet.
La comunicazione, per le persone più critiche,è solo un canale per tradurre i punti di vista degli esperti delle élite all’elettorato, senza considerare il potenziale dei cittadini nell’impegnarsi attivamente per risolvere i problemi e il processo decisionale delle comunità politiche. Quelli invece con unavisione più ottimistica, d’altra parte,credono che una forte governance democratica sia resa possibile dalla capacità dei media di educare il cittadino per facilitare la discussione, la riflessione e fare delle scelte politiche informate.
Queste doppie posizioni sono state approfondite e adottate da John Dewey e Walter Lippman negli anni ‘20 (Dewey, 1927; Lippmann, 1921).
Dewey sosteneva che la politica democratica si basava su di una sfera pubblica dei cittadini, esperti e giornalisti in comunicazione uno con l’altro. Lippman invece sosteneva che la maggior parte dei cittadini non fosse capace di un pensiero politico serio e che le questioni sociali complesse dovrebbero invece essere lasciate a coloro che li rappresentavano. (Loader, Vromen, Xenos, 2016)
Il modello di trasmissione di Lippman della comunicazione ha lasciatopoco spazio per i cittadini di impegnarsi in politica, lasciandogli come unica vera responsabilità la pratica del voto.
Deweynel suo modello, al contrario, esorta e scarica unaeccessiva responsabilità ai cittadini, giornalisti ed esperti di fare politica.
Questo dualismo è ancora contemporaneo, espresso dalla cattiva salute della nostra democrazia.Per questo motivo nel corso degli ultimi anni sono nate nuove forme di partecipazione politica, grazie soprattutto alla diffusione di internet e dei social media.
Una figura che oggi trova sempre più spazio nella vita politica democratica è il cittadinoEveryday Maker.
Queste persone non sono apatiche, ma è difficile che vogliano impegnarsi direttamente con lo stato o all’interno dei suoi organi. Inoltre, non hanno alcun interesse a impegnarsi o a partecipare nella vita politica di un partito. In molti casi non sono guidati da un senso di dovere, o da un’ideologia; né sono interessati ad acquisire influenza, ma piuttostovogliono sentirsi coinvoltie soprattutto, vogliono migliorarsi come individui.
Abbiamo perciò dei cittadini che vedono una partecipazione politica meno comunitaria e più orientata al singolo e che sono slegati da qualsiasi ideologia o appartenenza di gruppo.Di conseguenza, i politici devono impegnarsi continuamente con i cittadini inducendoli a partecipare. E per farlo, usano la comunicazione, i media e le celebrità.
È certamente vero che i politici e i partiti utilizzano sempre più gli strumenti mediatici di celebrità e che ilmarketing politicoè diventato una caratteristica molto importante della politica contemporanea. Eppure alcuni problemi nella nostra democrazia esistono e non sembrano essere affrontati.
Uno di questi èla figura del giovane cittadino. In genere raffigurato come un soggetto intento adisinteressarsi delle pratiche democratiche attraverso la sua apaticità e la sua non-attività politica, i giovani vengono così riconosciuti come cittadini ‘incapaci‘ sia da Lippman, o come ‘indegni‘ per unire comunità politiche da Dewey.
Questo etichettatura può essere vista anche per presentare ed esporre le preoccupazioni per l’influenza di Internet sulle future generazioni. Da questo punto di vista, questo mezzo di comunicazione sociale, non consente di rafforzare l’impegno democratico e agisce solo a minare ulteriormente la politica di ‘formazione’ dei giovani cittadini, tenendoli ai margini della sfera pubblica. Con la capacità di costruire le proprie reti di comunicazione al di fuori dei media tradizionali, i giovani possono più facilmente evitare argomenti o temi come la politica, l’economia, i problemi sociali e gli affari pubblici. Inoltre, il suo utilizzo come canale per la condivisione di “chiacchiere”, giocare con giochi online e guardare video viene visto come una ulteriore prova di come internet aumenti il deficit di attenzione politica dei giovani cittadini. Anche quando i giovani usano i social media per sostenere una campagna, o per firmare una petizione online, questo è considerato dalla critica comeslacktivismpiuttosto che vero e proprio impegno di cittadinanza (Loader, Vromen, Xenos, 2016).
Queste preoccupazioni circa gli effetti negativi di internet e dei social media sui giovani hanno cominciato a destare allarme e quindi aumentare l’attenzione su questo argomento da parte dei politici e degli addetti ai lavori.
Alcuni hanno cercato di rispondere a queste preoccupazioni argomentando che molti giovani cittadini sono sistematicamente esclusi dal sistema politico. L’accesso alla sfera pubblica per un giovane cittadino è stato spesso negata.
I requisiti di ingresso appropriati per partecipare all’attività politica non vengono rispettati dalle giovani generazioni, e di solito sono identificati con l’età e/o la poca capacità di ragionare ed esprimersi in maniera articolata sulla base di una solida conoscenza della materia in discussione.
Un’altra argomentazione sostiene che le pratiche di cittadinanza di molti giovani nelle società tardo-moderne hanno significativamente cambiato da un modo prescritto per uno che è più personalizzato e di auto-determinazione (Loader, Vromen, Xenos, 2016).
Nella teoria politica convenzionale un giovane è obbligato a partecipare alle elezioni e si deve unire ad organizzazioni politiche e civiche per promuovere temi, legarsi ad un movimento, manifestare per le proprie idee. Il giovane cittadino contemporaneo è invece più propenso ad impegnarsi attraverso canali informali e reti sociali non gerarchiche che sono mediate da piattaforme digitali.
I social media, come Facebook e Twitter, sono sempre più visti come il mezzo di comunicazione e di scelta per qualsiasi intento politico e soprattutto vengono visti come luogo dove catturare i voti dei giovani cittadini.
Queste piattaforme online hanno obbligato i partiti e i movimenti a modificare la loro politica di comunicazione in modi che dimostrano un’affinità più vicino all’esperienza vissuta dai giovani (e non) di oggi.
Selfie, tweet, profili di Facebook o di Instagram, sono parole ormai di uso comune nel linguaggio politicoe l’uso dei social media da parte dei politici viene visto come un’ulteriore prova per la promozione di spettacoli, come fossero celebrità, per costruire attivamente importanti basi elettorali di giovani elettori (Van Zoonen, 2005).
Gli stessi politici devono affrontare la concorrenza on-line per l’attenzione dei giovani cittadini dalle celebrities di intrattenimento, dello sport, di YouTube, ecc, intente a esprimere le proprie opinioni politiche o partecipare a importanti discussioni su svariati temi pubblici.
Questo potrebbe segnalare un ulteriore passaggio verso una nuova cultura pop on-line dei giovani cittadini, dove i politici e le celebrità si giocano il ruolo di protagonisti per catturare la loro attenzione.
Un’indicazione della natura banale della politica di celebrità e il continuo declino della democrazia per cui i politici dovrebbero utilizzare i social per attirare i giovani cittadini risulta sconfortante per molte persone(Crouch, 2004). Con essasi incoraggia lo spettacolo della politica di essere semplificata, sensazionalizzata per soddisfare un pubblico apatico, ignorante e con una scarsa capacità di attenzione. Da questo punto di vista, i social media continua semplicemente il danno fatto alla democrazia rappresentativa da piattaforme multimediali precedenti come la televisione (Putnam, 2000). Queste visioni pessimistiche sono, però, state contrastate nel corso dell’ultimo decennio da un certo numero di studiosi che hanno sostenuto che la celebrità politica deve essere presa sul serio.
La parte rappresentativa e la democrazia parlamentare potrebbero essere messe sotto pressione o addirittura minate se le celebrità vengono utilizzate per legittimare le decisioni politiche prese.Questa analisi non è ottimista circa il futuro della democrazia, ma per lui la speranza, come abbiamo citato nel paragrafo precedente, è neiEveryday Makerse il loro rifiuto di accettare per oro colato ciò che i politici o gli esperti sostengono.
La maggior parte della letteratura scientifica e sociale sul rapporto tra celebrità e democrazia tende a vedere il primo come un qualcosa che compromette quest’ultimo, anche se ci sono alcuni autori che vedono l’effetto delle celebrity come un beneficio.
L’adozione da parte dei politici di stili di comunicazione di solito associati alla cultura pop, come il marketing e l’intrattenimento, spesso viene vista in modo dispregiativo.
Un esempio èla banalizzazione della politica, che per David Meyer e Joshua Gamson (1995) sottolinea comele celebrità spostano la copertura dei media verso un focus con uno stile più personale e drammatico.
Infatti nel corso degli ultimi anni le emozioni sono state viste come un importante e legittimo fattore che modella la partecipazione dei cittadini.Passione e sentimenti non solo possono essere considerate come fonti di affinità, identificazione o valutazione critica, ma sono ormai alla base del vissuto impegno democratico.
La politica celebrità quindi ci restituisce uno sguardo ai nostri spazi comunicativi in cui i cittadini vivono la loro vita e dove i politici cercano il loro sostegno e la loro attenzione. Questo concetto ci aiuta a introdurre un argomento molto dibattuto nella letteratura, cioè cheil ruolo crescente delle celebrità in politica porta ad un abbassamento della qualità dei politici.La maggiore critica che viene posta è che i nostri rappresentati vengono apprezzati per il loro stile piuttosto che per le loro capacità, e chequesti hanno abbassato la qualità del dibattito politico.
Inoltre,la forte amplificazione, da parte dei media, delle voci delle celebrità nel discorso pubblico, può annullare o portare in secondo piano le prospettive o le opinioni fornite da altri, meno famosi e meno comunicativi, ma forse più competenti e più preparati.
Alcuni autori sono andati molto più in là nella loro critica, sottolineando l’aumento e la pervasività della cultura dell’entertainment e il suo rapporto con il predominio delle forze di mercato.
Marshall (1997) suggerisce che la celebrità comporta «la migrazione di strategie comunicative delle industrie di intrattenimento e di pubbliche relazioni nell’organizzazione dello spettacolo della politica».Questa migrazione nella politica di concetti come il marketing e la comunicazione è volto sempre più a promuovere l’individualismo, un fenomeno, come ricorda Marshall, che viene espresso dalle celebrità e dal capitalismo.
Accanto a questo fenomeno, possiamo trovare anche una tendenza apromuovere la personalizzazione.
John Corner, per esempio, fa la distinzione fra tre ambiti distinti: sfera politica, sfera pubblica e la sfera privata. La sfera politica, sostiene Corner, non tende a essere che una sfera mediata dalle prestazioni del politico, spesso a porte chiuse, con le interazioni con altri politicanti. Al contrario, la sfera pubblica è completamente mediata con il politico in esecuzione come figura pubblica. Egli suggerisce che la prima sfera può essere vista come un ‘luogo di lavoro’ e la seconda come un ‘negozio’, cioè un modo di come separare la produzione e il consumo di politica. Come altri, egli sostiene anche che la terza sfera, quella privata, è diventata di maggiore importanza con l’aumento del personaggio politico (Loader, Vromen, Xenos, 2016) che, nonostante le loro proteste, i politici hanno introdotto sempre più aspetti della loro vita sottolineato dall’uso massivo dei social media per tweeting e selfie. Tornado alla personalizzazione della politica, la priorità data ai profili e le prestazioni dei singoli politici, in particolare capi di partito, in campagne politiche e attraverso i mezzi di informazione, è stato offerto come prova di questa tendenza. Così, il sostegno dei cittadini e il loro impegno nelle campagne elettorali si è visto modellare da come essi reagiscono verso candidati politici e leader di partito (Coleman, 2013) (Loader, Vromen, Xenos, 2016). Questo fenomeno, come abbiamo citato sopra, ha portato anche a uno spostamento dell’attenzione dal volto pubblico dei politici per la loro vita privata.
Personalizzazione, individualismo, ci riportano al concetto di attivismo delle celebrità, alcuni autori suggeriscono che un regime di celebrità non è necessariamente dannoso per la società moderna e può essere vantaggioso per il nostro sistema politico. Una delle contro-critiche al sistema democratico occidentale (Orman 2003) ha voluto anticipare i tempi per quanto riguarda la sovrapposizione della celebrità e della politica:
Almeno in astratto, la possibilità di rinvigorire la politica americana con l’introduzione di nuova linfa e nuove idee. A differenza dei politici tradizionali, le celebrità non devono fare lunghi periodi di apprendistato prima che possano arrivare a lavorare o dirigere grandi uffici. Di norma, sono meno legati ad interessi politici acquisiti a causa della loro ricchezza o la capacità di raccogliere fondi da amici e familiari. In un mondo politico in cui le alleanze e gli accordi sono la regola, questi tipi di individui sono gli agenti più liberi e più autonomi che si possono trovare nel processo politico americano.
Un elemento cruciale della discussione qui è l’idea che un testimonial e l’attivismo può rinvigorire la politica democratica. Un esempio è che le celebrità insieme ai media possono semplificare un complesso dibattito politico rendendo le questioni più accessibili ai cittadini che sono meno politicamente consapevoli e interessati.La politica delle celebrità può quindi fornire un metodo poco ortodosso, ma potenzialmente efficace, di interrompere il monopolio delle pressioni della élite e delle lobby nelle agende politiche e nel dibattito pubblico.
Le celebrità hanno una capacità unica di raggiungere e mobilitare cittadini altrimenti apatici, e qualche volta riescono a dare voce alla disaffezione della politica o di altri temi nella società e sulla scena mondiale.
L’utilizzo di queste persone di strumenti come i social media può aumentare la conoscenza dei giovani cittadini di politiche, argomenti e valori.
Questo comporta anche un senso di affinità (identità) con il politico o celebrità politica che permette anche una valutazione emotiva. (che come abbiamo citato poco più sopra, l’emozione è centrale nel discorso politico della nostra società attuale)
Un altro modo in cuile celebrità possono influenzare e/o essere utilizzate è la loro partecipazione all’interno di movimenti,che siano di protesta o di organizzazione verso tematiche ambientali, sociali, ecc.
I mass media, in genere, concentrano la loro attenzione verso alcuni attori di un movimento e analizzano i loro comportamenti a scapito di altri. Come Gitlin (1980) documenta nel suo studio di copertura mediaticaStudents for a Democratic Societye il movimento contro la guerra negli anni 1960, i mass media tendevano a evidenziare la provocatorietà, o lo spettacolo orientandolo agli attori del movimento (esempio, le bandiere che richiamavano i Vietcong, il loro modo di vestirsi o di agire) e dandogli maggiore copertura, ignorando gli altri messaggi provenienti dal movimento. Da qui una piccola sezione di attori del movimento, scelti in gran parte dai mass media, è venuta a monopolizzare l’attenzione del pubblico ed è diventato de facto portavoce del movimento.
Per questo è sempre più comune vedere le celebrità come portavoce o sostenitori dei movimenti sociali. In qualità diheadlinerdi un evento, testimoniano, e la loro presenza viene evidenziata nei media tradizionali, dove gli intervistatori “spesso chiedono a loro di discutere dello stato di pace nel mondo, la loro posizione sul Medio Oriente, l’ambiente, la politica in generale, e così via” (West & Orman, 2003). Lo sviluppo e l’aumento di alleanze con celebrità per i movimenti sociali è chiara: le celebrità comandano l’attenzione e hanno la possibilità di parlare pubblicamente di questioni politiche, «mentre gli esperti sulle questioni, per non parlare dei cittadini medi, hanno molto meno possibilità di ottenere l’accesso ai media» (Kurz et al., 2007).
In un’epoca dove il pubblico risulta sempre più frammentato e distratto, e la concorrenza per raggiungere il pubblico di massa si è fatta molto più dura, molti più movimenti sociali si sono rivolti a questo percorso.
Un problema che risalta con l’attivismo delle celebrità è quella dello “standing”: le celebrità, essendo élite che sono ben fuori dalla classe media e provengono da sfondi privilegiati, gravitano verso i movimenti che o non sfidano o non possono coesistere con tali attributi (Meyer & Gamson, 1995).
In sintesi, i movimenti sociali sono attratti dalle celebrità per la loro capacità di comandare l’attenzione; Tuttavia, proprio come l’obiettivo per la copertura mediatica di acquisire attenzione, questa strategia può sia annegare e mettere in secondo piano altri attori del movimento, e può diluire il messaggio per renderlo conforme alle esigenze del personaggio o della celebrità.
Per questol’uso della celebrità è utile(e in molti casi fondamentale)all’inizio per aumentare e acquisire visibilità o importanza al movimento. La strategia poi dovrebbe sempre meno tener conto dell’influenza delle celebrities, per evitare che un movimento si colleghi o si plasmi sempre più con loro.","June 02, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analisi-la-democrazia-ammalata-tra-celebrita-movimenti-e-la-teoria-del-giovane-cittadino/,Norberto Cristofori,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
“I Can’t Breathe”: Enough is Enough,"Minneapolis is literally on fire sinceGeorge Floyd, 46, became the latest in a long line of black men and women to die in police custody. Derek Chauvin was called to the scene because Floyd was accused of writing a bad cheque; the scene climaxed with Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck, brutally suffocating him in broad daylight.
Video footagecaptured Floyd’s murder, restaurant surveillance footage discounted the claim he was resisting arrest, and outrage has exploded across the state, country, and globe. Within 24 hours protests and looting in Minneapolis, coupled with social media uproar, has electrified the world.
President Trump wasted no time in announcing via Twitter that he wouldsend in the National Guardif the Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, did not take the lead:
I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right…..
However, the Mayor has outlined his support for Floyd and has called for the offending officers to be arrested:
If most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they’d already be behind bars.That’s why today I’m calling on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to charge the arresting officer in this case.
The protests continue, becoming ever more violent, including theMinneapolis Police Department’s 3rd precinct being set on fire. More buildings have been set ablaze, there are currently 40 demonstrators under arrest, and one person has been shot. Teargas has been used by the police and the refusal of Target to hand out milk to help the affected protesters has led to its stores being looted across the state.
A state of emergency has been declared across Minnesota state, and protests have spread toNew York City,Denver,Los Angelesand other US cities. As this story is being written, a CNN crew have been placed under arrest for reporting the protests, issuing an apology from the Governor of Minneapolis.
‘I can’t breathe’ is the chant cascading across the cities, and not for the first time. The history of police brutality in America is shocking: in 2019,more than 1000 people dieddue to police brutality – there were only 27 days in 2019 when the police did not kill someone. In 2014, Eric Garner was murdered in exactly the same way as Floyd, saying the same final words, in New York City. In 2014, no-one was arrested or indicted for Garner’s murder, but today, the four policemen responsible for Floyd’s have been fired, and there are calls across the city for them to face criminal punishment.
In the last few hours,protesters’ voices have been heard: Chauvin has been charged with 3rddegree murder and manslaughter, which in Minnesota is punishable up to 20 years imprisonment. The investigation is ongoing; Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County Attorney, added: “we have never charged a case in that kind of time-frame, and we can only charge a case when sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond any reasonable doubt as of right we have it”. However, the other policemen at the crime scene are yet to face punishment, and there are many unhappy with Chavin’s charge criticising it for beingtoo little too late.
The US has far more incidents of killing due to police brutality than the rest of the Western world. Mass shootings have killed 339 people since 2015, but police shootings over the same time span have killed 4,355 people.Black people represent 13% of America’s population, but 31% of the victims of police.In 2014, the UN Committee against Torture condemned this brutality and highlighted the:
“frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals”
Associate Professor of Criminology, Lorie Fridell, explains the issue ofimplicit biasesaffecting our perception of threat; in studies, even Black and Latino officers were more likely to shoot an unarmed black man than an unarmed white one. The main reason for this bias development is:
“in our country, people of colour are disproportionately represented amongst the people who commit street crime”
This is one reason black people have faced far more police brutality than white people. One of the positives of this finding is that it progresses past the regressive tactic of blaming individual behaviour for these events, not that offenders should not be individually punished, but the problem is far wider and systemic than being a ‘few bad apples’.
Treating the issue as systemic allows us to see the other issues caused by the bias.For example, when we look at the racial and ethnic makeup of US prisons it is substantially different from the demographics of the country as a whole: In 2017, blacks represented 12% of the U.S. adult population but 33% of the sentenced prison population. Whites accounted for 64% of adults but 30% of prisoners. Assuming that this is because there is more crime in black communities than white ignores the real issue. And as we learn every time a black person is murdered by the force that should protect them, just because a system functions it does not mean it is functionally correctly or sustainably.
The imprisonment rate for ethnic minorities is declining; one reason is organisations such asthe Innocence Project:
“The Innocence Project’s mission is to free the staggering number of innocent people who remain incarcerated, and to bring reform to the system responsible for their unjust imprisonment”
The organisation uses DNA to exonerate innocent inmates; 47% of freed innocent people in the US are black. Looking at the cases, there is shockinglylittle evidence for the majority of the initial convictions, and it would be absolutely fair to say that there is explicit and systemic racial discrimination at play:
• The issue of racial discrimination is not applicable to the criminal justice system only. It leaks through into every facet of daily life – where is it coming from?
• How can it be stopped?

Il Caso Silvia Romano: Misoginia e Polarizzazione nella Società “Social” Italiana,"Lo scorso 9 Maggio,il presidente del consiglio italiano ha twittato la notizia della liberazione di Silvia Romano, rapita il 20 Novembre 2018 da unaguesthousenel villaggio di Chakama, in Kenya.
La ora venticinquenne è rimasta ostaggio del gruppo terroristico somalo Al Shabaab, responsabile di diversi atti terroristici. Tra i tanti ricordiamo laStrage di Garissadel 2 Aprile 2015, la quale provocò 150 vittime: tutti studenti universitari.
Oggi invece, grazie ai servizi esteri segreti italiani e alla mediazione dell’alleato NATO Turchia, Silvia è libera, persino senza la conferma del pagamento di un riscatto.Tuttavia la liberazione di Silvia non è stata alquanto semplice da digerire in Italia.
Per molti Silvia non è più Silvia, ma Aisha, il nome acquisito dopo laconversione all’Islamavvenuta durante i mesi di prigionia, e indossa unJilbab. Questo agli occhi di chi si aspettava che la giovane scendesse da quell’aereo come un’eroina tutta italiana e tutta cristiana non è andato giù. In più Silvia-Aisha sorrideva, felice, non era malmenata ed ha persino affermato che non le è stato fatto del male.
E perciò l’Italia conservatrice addita Silvia come una neo-terrorista, ma non al bar tra una partita a carte e un caffè: alla Camera dei Deputati. I commenti sui social seguono alimentati da fake news su un presunto pagamento di un riscatto, ancora non confermato:“Quanto ci è costata?” “Sai quanti italiani potevamo aiutare con 4 milioni?”. L’apice lo raggiunge la senatrice Daniela Santanchè del gruppo parlamentare Fratelli d’Italia, la quale in diretta Instagram si dice felice per la liberazione della giovane ma speranzosa che si disfarà del velo islamico per essere “davvero una donna libera”.
Al polo opposto si è invece levata la risposta dell’Italia progressista che ha visto il gesto di Silvia come anticonformista, emancipato, finanche femminista.
Le due tipologie di reazioni segnalano una questione comune:la società italiana è polarizzata. Questo fenomeno deriva dalla possibilità di personalizzare le proprie pagine social, sia tramite scelte presumibilmente consapevoli e personali, sia tramite l’operato di algoritmi che agiscono con scopi pubblicitari e di studio del comportamento umano su queste piattaforme.
Il contatto assiduo con opinioni simili alla nostra potrebbe inizialmente sembrare positivo, e sintomo di una società dove vige il libero pensiero, tuttavia, è il libero pensiero stesso che viene posto a rischio nel momento in cui ciò che si legge non è altro che l’eco dei nostri stessi pensieri.
L’immediato effetto della personalizzazione dei social sonol’estremismo e il partitismo radicale. L’utente social, nonché cittadino ed elettore, non entra in contatto con opinioni diverse e stratificate ma soltanto con voci che sono la ripetizione della propria e che vanno quindi ad alimentare esclusivamente le proprie convinzioni.
Il caso di Silvia Romano ne è un esempio esplicativo: nessuno ha saputo guardare oltre il velo da lei indossato, dipinto esclusivamente come simbolo di terrorismo o di emancipazione, ancora prima che alla diretta interessata sia stato dato il tempo e il rispetto di eventualmente esplicitare cosa rappresentasse.
La risposta dell’Italia conservatrice è dettata solo da un sentimento islamofobico o è forse misoginia?
Questo quesito lo ha sollevato la notte fra il 21 e il 22 maggioAndrea Villa, anche il “Banksy Torinese”, il quale ha tappezzato il capoluogo piemontese con manifesti raffiguranti Chiara Ferragni con indosso il velo islamico. “Siete sicuri di essere realmente liberi?” chiede.Che differenza c’è fra una religione che impone l’uso del velo per le donne e una società che detta canoni di bellezza femminile ai quali è alquanto difficile non sottostare?
Per di più questi canoni li tramanda nei suoi canali di comunicazione continuamente. Basti pensare aGiovanna Botteri, giudicata per l’abito e non per le straordinarie capacità giornalistiche;Carola Rackete, sentenziata per non aver indossato il reggipetto anziché sulla nobiltà o gravità del suo gesto; infineSilvia-Aisha, accolta con odio nonostante il suo sorriso di benessere da quelli che hanno visto il loro melodramma catto-occidentale distrutto, e da venerazione per chi l’ha percepita come la nuova Simone de Beauvoir, senza che lei ne reclamasse il titolo.
Morale della storia?
In Italia, le donne non possono ancora scegliere i propri titoli.
Inoltre, la mancata neutralità e sobrietà nella risposta pubblica ha impedito che sorgessero spontaneamente domande assai più urgenti.Come mai esistono piccole associazioni come Africa Milele Onlus, alla quale si era iscritta Silvia che mancano di protocolli adeguati di sicurezza?

Rischio Spillover: a fine emergenza ne dovremo tener conto.,"È ormai quasi certo che l’attuale crisi pandemica è stata causata dall’eccessiva vicinanza tra il mondo umano e quello animale.L’invasione del secondo da parte del primo ha ricordato come gli ecosistemi siano caratterizzati da delicate strutture e che per tali ragioni vanno tutelate.
Ogni specie animale porta con sé una serie di virus che vive in equilibrio in quell’ecosistema: distruggendolo o alternandolo il virus cercherà un nuovo ambiente ospite, un nuovo equilibrio.
Si verificherebbe il cosiddettoeffetto Spillover(lett. fuoriuscita), il passaggio da parte del virus dalla specie animale a quella umana –come in questo caso.La fine di questa crisi ci impone quindi di considerare tutti i rischi a cui è soggetta la vulnerabile razza umana: questo ne è sicuramente uno.
Dal 1960 al 2014 è stato registrato un aumento significativo di malattie infettive. Come mostrato in uno studio del 2008 a cura della professoressa di ecologia e biodiversità presso la UCL, Kate E. Jonesoltre il 60% delle malattie emerse in quegli anni proveniva dalla specie animale.
Ricordiamo la Sars-Cov-2 di cui vettore ne fu il pangolino malese; la Mers- Cov in medio oriente diffusa tramiti camelidi infetti.Queste malattie, definite prodotto dizoonosi, sono il risultato di un errato comportamento umano verso il mondo animale: larapida urbanizzazionespesso anche in zone remote della terra, ildisboscamento di forestedove vivono un’infinità di specie viventi con delicati ecosistemi, sono il fattore principale di questa tragica conseguenza sulla salute umana.
Tuttavia, il rischio spillover è da sempre presente, ciò che è cambiato è che negli ultimi decenni è diventato più frequente e pericoloso.
Un virus che abita un determinato ambiente, per la naturale tendenza alla riproduzione quanto più rapida e massiccia possibile, se viene a contatto con un altro habitat accogliente tenderà ad invaderlo.
Molti studiosi ritengono infatti che l’attuale virus – parte del gruppo dei Coronavirus – abbia avuto origine proprio nei mercati di fauna selvatica in Cina: il“wet market” di Wuhan è molto famoso per la vendita di animali selvatici (vivi e morti) come pipistrelli, pangolini, salamandre, ratti.Proprio per questa caratteristica è stato ritenuto lostarting pointper la ricerca delle cause del Covid-19 dallo stesso Governo di Xi Jinping.
Il problema per la razza umana è che virus presenti in alcuni animali selvatici (ad esempio il pipistrello) vengono tenuti sotto controllo dai sistemi immunitari di questi animali, quindi proliferano nei loro organismi rimanendo quasi indisturbati.Al contrario, questi risultano estremamente pericolosi per i nostri sistemi immunitari che non hanno le capacità di reazione sufficienti per sconfiggerli.
Ma come possiamo arginare questo problema? Basterebbe solo vietare la vendita di animali selvatici sui mercati?
Non basterebbe.Mercati di questo genere sono maggiormente diffusi in Paesi in via di sviluppo e sono parte di radicatecultureetradizionidi questi popoli.Vietarne la vendita, quindi regolamentare il mercato, è certamente un passo importante. Ma bisogna considerare che questi mercati generano milioni di dollari di ricavi e danno lavoro ad un ingente parte della popolazione.
È necessaria quindi anche unamodifica del sistemaoffer and demand: se i Paesi ricchi continueranno a richiedere massicce quantità di materie prime e di animali esotici ai Paesi in via di Sviluppo, l’offerta non cambierà.Le foreste continueranno ad essere disboscate e private della fauna che le abita; gli animali selvatici cacciati e venduti su mercati nazionali e internazionali. Vietarne la sola vendita incrementerebbe traffici illegali e il bracconaggio.
Bisogna agire congiuntamente sulla cultura locale modificandone gli atteggiamenti, fortificando l’informazione, l’educazione e la sensibilizzazione su certi temi.Informare i produttori e i consumatori dei rischi in cui si incorre con queste pratiche.Educare le nuove generazioni al rispetto degli ambienti naturali. Sensibilizzare Paesi ricchi e poveri rispetto ai vantaggi di un mondo più equilibrato, proteso verso il raggiungimento di livelli alti di sostenibilità ambientale, sociale ed economica.
È necessario un vero e propriocambio di paradigma: comprendere che azioni invasive portano profitti solo nel breve periodo e che le conseguenze di queste azioni richiedono spesso investimenti economico-sociali superiori ai profitti ottenuti.Il termine sfruttare dovrà essere sostituito dal termine usare e preservare a devastare.Questa crisi sanitaria in cui siamo immersi è e deve essere un importante monito per le prossime azioni perché imparare dal passato per evitare in futuro gli stessi errori è sempre possibile.

13th,"I can’t breathe.
These are the words that have shook the world. The crude murder ofGeorge Floydby a member of the Minneapolis Police Department has started a chain of reaction that now sees Minnesota’s chief town in riot. And yes, I saidmurder, for the action of former police officer Derek Chauvin cannot just be dismissed as an excess of force during the arrest. Yet, as an act of manslaughter guided by racial hate. And as such, it begets anger from those who cannot just stand by for such events.
The Minneapolis riots have further split the public opinion. While many argue that violent protest is not effective, and that the collateral damage to this protest can only create more harm; many others believe that “A riot is the language of the Unheard” (Ed.in theown words of Dr. Martin Luther King), and what is happening now in Minneapolis is a whole community screaming back to react to a hegemonic condition that has oppressed them for centuries. Indeed, the driving force of this protest is not only thedemand for justicefor a hate crime, it is acommunity reacting to the systematic oppression and prejudicethat they can no longer endure.
George Floyd sadly wasnot the first person of color to be assassinated by law enforcement. However, in an already precarious situation due to thelack of guidance by the Trump administration in front of the Covid-19 pandemic: when within weeks you see first white men parading the Capital carrying automatic rifles to pretest the lockdown be left unbothered, while a black man is suffocated on the sidewalk, people could not take it anymore. This was not just a case ofpolice brutality, this was hard evidence that the United States does not treat his people equally, and all of this because of the tone of their skin.
As a European myself, it is not easy for me to fully comprehend how deeply rooted in history this issue is. Indeed, this goes beyond “simple” racism. The issue of civil right for people of color in the US is the tale of a country that is at war with itself. As such, one of the most important things people can do, alongside supporting the public up-roar of this event, is to actually try and understand this issue at its core. While doing so, I stumbled upon the incredibledocumentary by Ava DuVernay, “13th”.
This was quite frankly one of the most potent and masterfully crafted documentary I have seen in a long time. Personally, I am not a big fan of the whole “documentary format”.  I believe that thetalking headsway of storytelling deprives many productions, as it goes against one of the foundations of movie making: show don’t tell. However, when the argument is so dense, and the guests speaking to you impactful, suddenly the talking heads transform into a sort of heart to heart that wraps the viewer and glues him to the screen.
Concise yet powerful, as it barely surpasses the 90 minutes length,13thdeals with thelack of proper jurisdiction and integration of people of color in modern America. This documentary is actually the first non-fiction film to open the New York film festival in 2016 to an adoring crowd. The starting premise concerns the 13thAmendment, which was the first of the amendment ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War in 1865. Whereas this act legally abolished slavery, it came with a loophole that has been exploited for generations. Which was, if you were a criminal that was being punished in a US prison, you could still be held in servitude and bondage.
This ties with theissue of police brutality and biases in arresttowards people of color, which is was even enhanced by the fact that mass incarceration became heavily monetized when the US government lent their prison’s equipment to private investors (such as ALEC). This made the carceral system a business just like any other, a business which runs on incarcerating people. As such, it creates a paradoxical situation where the latest projections show that there are more black people incarcerated now than there were enslaved in the 1850.
This issue is dealt in the blunt yet meaningful way. Ava DuVernay, alongside her incredible ensemble, guides the audience through this issue, and piece by piece she reconstructs how this hegemonic system has come into place.
Starting from the 13thamendment and going through the presidencies of Nixon, Reagan and Clinton and the empowerment of the fight on crime, which was really a fight to oppress poor black people, Ava DuVernay makes her points methodically and without rushing through.
As I would like our readers to watch this documentary to learn the things that I have learnt, I won’t go in any further details to avoid spoiling it. However, it is important want to leave you with one thought before I wrap up today.
The whole purpose of The New Global Order is to share information, to connect the young generations with the bigger issues we are facing in this modern world. As such, the point of the rubric “Cinema and Society”, is thatwe at TNGO believe that cinema, just like any other form of art, can functions as a looking class, a prism through which we can perceive the different aspects of reality that we would otherwise not miss.
Thus, in this particular historical moment, when we are facing a crisis that stems from ignorance, the art of movie-making can help us better understand what the issue at stake really is. Other than 13thwhich I have just discussed, I can name dozens of incredible movies fromSelma,Color Purple,Do the Right thing,GreenbookandPridethat deal with these issues.
These movies can help sensitize broader audiences to the issue at stake, so that we learn and internalize this struggle, and finally fight as one to overcome it.

Combattere la criminalità rispettando i diritti umani: è possibile?,"28 anni fa, in Italia, veniva redatto l’articolo 41bisdell’ordinamento penitenziario, per istituire unregime carcerario speciale. Tale provvedimento nasceva in risposta agli atti terroristici da parte di partiti politici e criminalità organizzata nell’Italia dei primi anni ’90.
In particolare, il bisogno era quello di evitare che boss ed esponenti di rilievo della criminalità italiana potessero comunicare con l’esterno e continuare ad organizzare e dirigere atti criminali.
Il regime detentivo speciale del 41bisprevede unostretto controllo del detenuto con il fine di assicurarne l’isolamento. La persona, quindi, vive in una cella singola, può effettuare chiamate telefoniche mensili controllate e ha contatti ridotti anche con il personale del carcere ed altri detenuti.
In ripetute occasioni, le rigide limitazioni del regime di detenzione speciale 41bishanno attirato l’attenzione e i puntali giudizi dellaCorte Europea per i Diritti Umani(“CEDU”), la quale è intervenuta in merito al rispetto dei diritti fondamentali dell’uomo nell’attuazione di questo regime.
La Commissione straordinaria del Senato Italiano per la tutela e la promozione dei diritti umani chiarisce che la CEDU non ha riscontrato alcuna violazione dellaConvenzione Europea sui Diritti Umaninelle predisposizioni dettate dall’articolo 41bis, mentre ha invece messo in evidenza un possibilecontrasto tra i principi della Convenzione e l’articolo dell’ordinamento penitenziario in questione.
Ad esempio, nel caso Enea c. Italia del 2009, la CEDU haritenuto che ci fosse un’evidente violazione dell’art. 8 della Convenzione, il quello che sancisce il rispetto della vita privata e familiare. La corrispondenza diSalvatore Enea, considerato coinvolto nei crimini di Cosa Nostra e quindi detenuto nel regime carcerario speciale 41 bis, era stata costantemente controllata dal momento della sua detenzione in carcere, violando quindi i diritti del detenuto.
Nello stesso caso citato, la CEDU si è espressa anche riguardo lo stato di salute del detenuto, sostenendo che “le condizioni di detenzione di una persona malata devono garantire la tutela della sua salute,” in linea con l’art. 3 della Convenzione che protegge l’integrità fisica della persona.
Il sistema penitenziario italiano ha ancora strada da fare per ottemperare ai principi europei di protezione dei diritti umani e alle raccomandazioni che ilComitato Europeo per la Prevenzione della Tortura (“CPT”) ha rinnovato in un report del 2017, sottolineando la necessità di piùcoordinazione tra il carcere e il sistema sanitario regionaleper il trasferimento di detenuti in gravi condizioni di salute.
Probabilmente, è anche su questa necessità che si sono basate le recenti decisioni prese dal Magistrato di Sorveglianza di Milano e dal Tribunale di Sorveglianza di Sassari sul trasferimento di due detenuti dal regime speciale 41bisalla detenzione domiciliare. Evidentemente,le strutture sanitarie delle carceri non sono adeguatea tenere sotto controllo le condizioni di salute dei loro ospitie, come già noto da mesi, i sistemi sanitari delle regioni italiane sono stati messi a dura prova dalla gestione dei ricoveri di pazienti Covid-19, quindi vi sarebbe stato un alto rischio di contagio.
I detenuti in entrambe le carceri di massima sicurezza erano stati per crimini di mafia, ma si trovavano in gravi condizioni di salute e necessitavano cure specifiche. Il detenuto collocato a Milano aveva quasi terminato di scontare la pena. Per il detenuto a Sassari, invece, non era stata data alcuna risposta riguardo una migliore locazione per assicurargli le cure necessarie, quindi Tribunale ha ritenuto poco rischioso il trasferimento ai domiciliari dato che il soggetto si era costituito spontaneamente e aveva trascorso un lungo periodo in carcere, elementi che potrebbero aver contribuito ad un allentamento dei legami con la criminalità organizzata.
Le decisioni hanno chiaramente suscitato molto scalpore nell’opinione pubblica, perché i media parlano di ‘scarcerazione di boss mafiosi,’ dinnanzi alla quale molti italiani appaiono mostrare indignazione. In effetti, non si può sottovalutare la pericolosità degli individui e la possibilità di continuare ad operare, discriminanti che avevano determinato l’applicazione del regime di detenzione 41bis.Non sono quindi mancate le polemiche nei confronti del Ministro della Giustizia Bonafede il quale, alcuni giorni più tardi,ha firmato un decreto per il ritorno in carcere.
Il regime di detenzione speciale 41bisrappresenta senza dubbio un importante spunto di riflessione per un dibattito più ampio sullanecessaria coesistenza tra la condanna della criminalità e il rispetto dei diritti umani. Molti italiani sono preoccupati di essere conosciuti a livello globale per gli atti criminali delle organizzazioni a stampo mafioso; la condanna di boss mafiosi e di persone legate alla mafia nel rispetto dei loro diritti potrebbe essere un’opportunità per l’Italia per dimostrare al mondo chela criminalità può essere combattuta senza privare alcun essere umano dei suoi diritti fondamentali e inderogabili.

The Coronavirus Vaccine and Medical Racism in Africa,"At the beginning of April, the WHO dissociated itself from the declarations of two French doctors, Camille Locht and Jean-Paul Mira. The latter asserted during a TV broadcast that it would be fruitful to carry a study to find aCoronavirus vaccine in Africasince the continent does not have sanitary resources such as surgical masks.
These allegations may seem isolated from the principles of the WHO but the truth isthe continent suffers from long-standing medical racism.
For instance, in 1996 the pharmaceutical company Pfizer conducted experiments during a meningitis epidemic in Kano, Nigeria, without receiving any consent from the families of the children used for the tests. Furthermore, in 2014, during the Ebola epidemic 269 thousand samples of blood from patients of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia were used for foreign research without the consent of the local researcher who collected the samples, let alone of those from whom the samples were taken.
While this leaves no doubt about the fact that many unscrupulous doctors perceive Africans as their guinea pigs, on the other handconducting medical researches in Africa holds great scientific potential for the local and the world population. However, this has often been ignored. The lack of focus for Africa in studies on the human genome compromised scientific progress as well as the chance for a better understanding and representation of the population of a whole continent.
Today, with the spread of Coronavirus, we have the opportunity to revalue this chance and to find a solution for a pandemic disease that has inevitably changed the face of our world. And this opportunity can only be exploited at best if we start investing in aneven distribution of medical resources and equipment in the continent, not only in Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt, which alone represent ⅔ of the Resource and Development spending.
Moreover, a project of this magnitude requires a crucial dose ofethical obligations. For starters, local consent is necessary and results must be shared with those who collaborated in finding them, even if “only” by donating a sample of their DNA. Communication officers and writers can collaborate in order to make the results clear.
Additionally, we must address the need for compensation, especially when private pharmaceutical companies exploit African epidemics for raw profits. Medical equipment, free access to diagnostic services, cheaper vaccines, or medicines: these are just examples of the myriad of possible solutions for an equal and fair collaboration.
The implications of such ethical obligations would be multiple, however, thetrust in medical development from localsis one of the most essentials. Especially after observing how certain countries like Madagascar are promoting and testing non-scientific natural solutions for Coronavirus on their inhabitants, which are often and arguably comprehensively sceptic about Western medical products.
Finally, on an ideological level scientific innovation must move away from itsOrientalist way of thinking. Edward Said (1978) denounced how Europe constantly ‘otherized’ non-Western civilizations, whilst exploiting their natural richness by justifying it as a mission to bring culture and development.
The declarations of the two French doctors are deeply embedded in this type of reasoning, but they are not alone. China and the USA have recently fought over China’s construction of a medical centre in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia since Trump saw Beijing’s action as an intention to possess crucial genomic material. There is no doubt, for many it is still a matter of commercial interest and not of genuine scientific collaborations and development. That is why an ideological shift is now, more than ever, necessary.
Development and balanced North-South collaborations will never be a reality if we do not move away from the 20th-century colonial perspective of exploiting Africa’s resources, much less if we do not deconstruct our neo-imperial view of the West as the charitable-donor and the ‘Rest’ as the mere recipient.

Covid-19 Did Not Stop the Fight for Justice in Lebanon – A Conversation with Laila Kaddour,"In October 2019,protestsagainst a corrupted government and economic mismanagement initiated in Lebanon. After 8 months, the economic conditions in Lebanon seem to have worsened.
The spread of Covid-19 had a disruptive impact on countries’ economies, and Lebanon is not the exception.
Laila Kaddour, from Tripoli, Lebanon, was interviewed by TNGO’s political analystAurora Ceccottito have a personal point of view about what it means to live in Lebanon in this unprecedented historical period.
Aurora:The protests resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri. In practice, did you notice changes that practically ameliorated people’s life?
Laila: The ex-prime minister Hariri’s resignation gave us hope, you could see the protesters growing stronger and they will become more powerful. It led us to believe that we could drive them out of office, one by one. However, I would like to state that Hariri never did do anything to ease the life of the Lebanese nor did he do anything that, per se, hurt us besides him being a part of therotten governmentthat was and still is stealing from its citizens.
Aurora:Did the government provide any type of financial benefit to people economically affected by the pandemic?
Laila: At first, the government asked a lot of documents from the citizens who were qualified to get financial benefits. This, in turn, cost them more money than the money that was being distributed. The money being distributed was 400,000 Lebanese Liras which in the current market exchange rate is equivalent to $100 or €90. This is a one-off payment and will not be distributed again. However, the government then decided to not go through with asking the citizens for their documents and just sent their army to distribute the money in the poorer areas. Nevertheless, what the government has failed to show is thatthey had a hand in stealing this money from their people too. They had people on their list who have previously passed away and took those 400,000 Lebanese Liras to themselves all while claiming to give it to the deceased. They also decided to influence the amount spent by dividing them equally into the different religious groups (i.e. the same number of Muslims as those of Christians, including the different sects in each).
Aurora:Are protests still taking place? If so, how are they affected by the pandemic?
Laila:The protests have not ceased since the start of the revolution; however, they have dwindled in size. Instead of the large crowd that started off in October and November, we now have a small number of people marching on the streets daily asking for our basic rights. The pandemic has not at all affected the protests since, as many have stated,they would rather die from the virus than from their own hunger and watching their children starve to death. I do expect that the protests will grow soon as there have been more and more people let go from their jobs. It is also crucial to point out that there now exist around 2 million Lebanese residents below the poverty line and the rate of this is growing slowly but surely. This will definitely be a drive to have those people join the protests.
Aurora:Around the world, there has been a development of anti-lockdown movements for the sake of a quicker economic recovery. Are such movements present in Lebanon?
Laila: No such movement has taken place in Lebanon. This is due to the fact that although there were rules laid out by the government, it has not been properly implemented. In the capital, Beirut, I have seen a better implementation of these rules, but it is not hard to break them. For example, in the previous weeks, the government set out a curfew at 7 PM allowing no one to leave their houses. I have seen some cars on the roads after that time and many on the street just walking around. In Tripoli, on the other hand, there has been no implementation of these rules among the others laid out.No one adheres to the rules due to their need to provide. I can easily claim that these past few weeks with the lock-down rules have been no different than a year ago, before the COVID-19 outbreak.
Aurora: The economic crisis in Lebanon has reached an alarming level, as consumer prices are peaking, and the Lebanese currency has crashed. What does it mean in practice? How does this crisis affect your and people’s lives?
Laila: The economic crisis in Lebanon could be compared to that of Venezuela, we have different currency exchange levels for different working sectors: the banks have one which differs from that which is the official one set by the government which also is different from that of the current exchange rate set by the currency exchange offices. In other words,you tend to pay with the highest exchange rate but get paid with the lowest.
As for our purchasing power, it has taken a hit. As we import most of our products, this means that the prices of those products have to go up since the buyers have to pay for these at the current exchange rate. And since the banks have not let us wire and transfer our money abroad, we have not been able to pay for products that we usually import from abroad.Lebanon is not capable of surviving without the importssince we do not produce much and do not have substitutes for those products. It is also worth mentioning thatthe government is doing nothing to help its citizens with this.
Aurora: Any final comment?
Laila: These people in power that we have placed our trust in have stripped us of our basic rights. We do not know what the future holds but with the way things are going I expect our rates of unemployment and poverty to increase and our purchasing power to decrease as well as our quality of living.I hope for better times and I hope for justice to be served.

La Nuova Era Spaziale: Perché il lancio della Crew Dragon di SpaceX è così importante,"Lo scorso 30 maggio, SpaceX ci ha fatto sognare per qualche minuto. Ci siamo dimenticati momentaneamente di tutte le problematiche che affliggono tutta la comunità internazionale, in modo particolare l’emergenza da Coronavirus.
Cape Canaveral, famosa per il lancio di astronauti nello spazio, ha segnato un’altra pagina della storia. Abbiamo, infatti, assistito a un nuovo lancio di astronauti verso la Stazione Spaziale Internazionale (ISS). Ma questa volta si è trattato di un lancio speciale sotto vari punti di vista.
Dalla rampa di lancio39/A di Cape Canaveral, la stessa rampa dei lanci storici di Apollo e Shuttle, i due astronauti,Bob BehnkenandDoug Hurley, sono partiti diretti verso la ISS a bordo dellacapsula Dragon del razzo Falcon 9. Questo non è stato un lancio come gli altri. Per la prima volta nella storia, Bob e Doug hanno preso parte alla missioneDemo-2, la prima missione umana realizzata dalla NASA in collaborazione con una compagnia privata, laSpaceXdel visionario imprenditoreElon Musk.
Il lancio rappresenta il culmine del programma di sviluppo di veicoli spaziali per il trasporto di umani da parte di SpaceX. Al tempo stesso, il lancio del 30 maggio segna il ritorno del lancio di missili per lo spazio nel territorio degli Stati Uniti dal 2011, anno in cui la NASA ha terminato il suo programma di Space Shuttle.
Il lancio del razzo Falcon 9 con la capsula Dragon di SpaceX non è soltanto una distrazione mediatica. E’ un evento ricco di significati per gli Stati Uniti e per il mondo intero.
La collaborazione tra SpaceX e la NASA è iniziata nel 2010, nell’ambito delCommercial Crew Program. La NASA, quindi, non produce più i veicoli ma si serve del servizio di trasporto (privato) offerto da SpaceX. Questa partnership tra pubblico e privato consente agli Stati Uniti di riorganizzare le proprie capacità di lancio e di beneficiare dell’innovazione tecnologica sviluppata dal partner, sperando di raggiungere Marte entro il 2025, come previsto dallo stesso Elon Musk.
La collaborazione SpaceX-NASA porta con sé anche importanti benefici economici e finanziari per gli Stati Uniti. L’8 luglio 2011è la data in cui degli astronauti per l’ultima volta sono stati lanciati per lo spazio dal suolo americano. Questa data ha segnato così la fine del programma di Space Shuttle. Da allora, la NASA ha portato i suoi astronauti sulla ISS facendo affidamento su razzi russi per lanciare gli scienziati, con un costo medio$80 milioniper posto per astronauta. Senza dubbio, grazie alla collaborazione con partner domestici, la NASA sfruttare un notevole risparmio.
Un altro fattore collegato al lancio della Crew Dragon riguarda l’apertura di una nuova industria vera e propria. Il lancio sta promuovendo l’economia spaziale americana in un momento in cui imprenditori e compagnie private stanno investendo sempre più nel settore spaziale con l’idea di aprire una nuova era di voli spaziali umani regolari. Elon Musk ha fondato la sua SpaceX nel 2002 con l’intento di costruire razzi e rendere accessibili a tutti i viaggi spaziali.
Ma non è l’unico visionario. Nel 2004, il patron del gruppo Virgin, Richard Branson, ha fondato laVirgin Galacticper realizzare un’offerta di voli spaziali suborbitali per il mercato commerciale. Negli ultimi decenni, lo spazio è diventato l’oggetto di una vera e propria corsa milionaria dove Musk e Branson sono i protagonisti principali, insieme al fondatore di Amazon Jeff Bezos. Probabilmente, in futuro non troppo lontano, lo spazio non sarà più una semplice fantascienza per molti di noi.
Infine, il lancio della navicella Dragon, rinominata ‘Endeavor’ da Bob e Doug in onore del loro primo lancio, arriva in un momento molto delicato nella nostra storia. Per pochi minuti, tutti quanti ci siamo fatti trasportare dalla fantasia e ci siamo dimenticati delle varie battaglie che stiamo combattendo al momento, primo fra tutti il Covid-19. Il generale senso di ottimismo generato dal lancio di SpaceX gioca un ruolo fondamentale in questo momento particolare. Ci ricorda cosa siamo capaci di fare e rendere possibile quando collaboriamo per raggiungere un obiettivo comune.

Libya At War: How Did It All Start?,"It was only days ago when mass graves were discovered in the north-western Libyan town of Tarhuna after General Khalifa Hifter’s loyalists retreated from the area due to military defeats in the recent weeks.
The gravesites are only agruesome trace of the atrocities committed during the Second Libyan Civil War, begun back in 2014 and fueled by international interests in the country’s natural resources and domestic competition for political primacy.
The roots of the conflict lie however in theearly-2010s transition of the Libyan people from Colonel Qaddafi’s forty-year-long rule to a mass mobilizationin the name of political representation, self-determination, and deep economic reform.
Since 2011, when the first intrastate warfare broke out, Libya entered a state ofsubsisting political instabilitythat has been hindering to this very day the possibility of pursuingstructural policy reformsand starting apeace-building processunder international auspices, as many would have hoped for after the Colonel’s fall.
The civil conflict that erupted in Libya in 2011 and escalated throughout the following year, also known asFirst Libyan Civil War, took place during the pivotal period of theArab Spring.
With Middle Eastern and Northern African protesters flooding in their national squares, demanding for a shift of power away from decades-standing dictators and autocrats, the Libyan case came to develop peculiar features that marked its political developments, significantly different from neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.
The determinants of such a peculiar escalation of violence range from systemic momentum for political transition in the grander picture of the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings of 2011 to the rise of a consolidated opposition to Qaddafi’s leadership. Nevertheless, state-focused analyses of the causes behind such conflict seem to provide unique insights about the nature and the internal drivers of what morphed from local protests to a blood-soaked intrastate warfarein the span of roughly a month.
As a matter of fact, systemic and individual-level analyses of the international scenario back in 2011 fail to illuminate factors that could justify the abyssal difference in nature, magnitude, and means of the Libyan uprisings compared to neighboring (and analogously illiberal) Tunisia and Egypt, where pacific demonstrations alone managed to galvanize political change.
Even though exact figures are difficult to draw due to the Libyan government’s clamp on media, independent researches estimate “a total of21,490(0.5%)persons … killed,19,700(0.47%)injuredand435,000(10.33%)displaced” between February 2011 and February 2012, a clear-cut testimony of the intensity of the conflict (Daw et al. 2015).
The key peculiarities of the Libyan state that provide insights on the origins of the first civil conflict can be identified inthree factors:
Libya had been experiencing along process ofresource nationalizationthat started right after 27-year-old captain Muammar al-Qaddafi seized power with a coup d’état back in 1969 together with a Revolutionary Command Council (Encyclopaedia Britannica2011).
As soon as in 1970, Qaddafi indeed started to take into the public sector theLibyan oil industry, transforming a variegated – yet only partially diversified – economy into an entirely oil-reliant system (Pargeter 2016).  With the progressiverestriction of private ownership and commerce, along with the disruption of one of the most stable markets that resisted oil fluctuation-induced stagnation – i.e. real estate,entrepreneursand the Libyanmiddle classwere drastically impoverished.
Thesanctions imposed by the United Nations and the United Statesin the 1990s in relations to international investigations concerning the bombing of a civilian flight (the infamous“Pan Am flight 103” case) ultimately coupled with the1993 oil crisisto shutter what was remaining of the non-oil-reliant Libyan economy (Encyclopaedia Britannica2011).
In 2009, Libya reported anunemployment rate fluctuating around 20%, with roughly 43% households depending on a single income and some 33,000 families “living in unhealthy housing conditions” (REUTERS2009) despite Qaddafi’sdistribution of oil revenues in guise of national income.
The argument that the economic frustration had a paramount role in the ante-war Libyan society is further reinforced if we consider that, as soon as news of the Tunisian protests started to spread around the country, Qaddafi’s leadership ostensibly inaugurated a series of public meetings with prominent political figures while promptly proposing a country-wideincrease of salaries(Pargeter 2012, 218).
The violence and rapid spread of the 2011 protests, which was conducive to a fully-fledged warfare, can thus be interpreted in light of theeconomic exasperation of a vast majority of Libyansthat roots directly back to the country’s history of economic reforms.
The 2011 protests had atransversal dimensionthat differentiated it from previous endeavors of riot and insurgency against Libya’s political establishment.
Libyans had indeed grown resentful and confrontational against the establishment that the Colonel created, often referred toQaddafism– meant to represent the series of social, political and economic policies that characterized Libya from 1969 to 2011, rather than against the Colonel himself.
The previously mentioned crumbling of popular committees and the overallabsence of political organization in Libya(Brynen and Mekouar 2013) had hitherto hindered any attempt to transfer political power away from the Libyan political establishment.
A national phenomenon however compensated for this lack of socio-political structure, that is what Mekouar (2014) defines a “local informational cascade” (211). While past demonstrations escalated into violence and local guerrilla, loyalist senior members of the Libyan political elite had always backed the ruling leader.
In 2011,defections of prominent officials– among others were the country’s Minister of Justice M. Abdeljalil, Minister of Interior Abdel Fattah Younes, senior military commander Suleiman Mahmud, and several high-level diplomats – de facto endorsed the revolutionary momentum by underlining a common grievance under Qaddafi’s rule (Mekouar 2014, 211).
The confirmation that dissatisfaction with the regime was not only the common man’s struggle, but it directly involved the political and military elite of the country did nothing but conferlegitimacy to the protesters, conveying the idea that2011 represented “an exceptional historic momentum that needed to be seized” (Mekouar 2014, 212).
Under Qaddafi’s rule, Libyans had undergone a process oftotal alienation from political powerthat was initially set off by the former captain’sThird Universal Theoryof governance, which – while envisioning a direct rule of the people – entailed the elimination of any governmental bureaucratic apparatus and its replacement withpopular committees(Encyclopaedia Britannica2011).
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, however, Qaddafi tightened its grip on power while popular committees, lacking country-wide organizational and bureaucratic structures, lost their efficacy and representation powers. Regions such as theCyrenaicaand theJabal Nafusawere neglected and antagonized by Qaddafi as the former lost all political power after the 1969 revolution and the latter was abode to the Berber population – the Libyan regime refrained from recognizing the country’scultural heterogeneity(Joffe 2011, 14).
Internal dissent grew stronger throughout the 1990s.Three internal crises, the last of which resulting in a failed coup in 1993 against the Colonel, reflected an overall popular enmity against the regime. The army was progressively led to hostility againstQaddafism, as anti-coup restrictive measures were put in place by the Libyan leadership upon the military.
Finally, scandals such as thesuppression of the prison riot in Tripolithat resulted in 1,300 deaths permanently damaged the regime’s credibility to its people (Joffe 2011, 14).
The late-2000s reformist wave, spearheaded by theColonel’s son Saif Al-Islam, did not produce the desired outcome, and it can be argued that it officially sanctioned the notion that Qaddafi’s political power and economic model were being questioned. The cross-class and cross-generational wave of protests that followed thearrest of human right activist Jamal al-Hajjican be considered a consequential result of growing societal discontent.
In conclusion, proponents of a state-level analysis of theFirst Libyan Civil Warcould argue that the combination of those three exclusivelynational peculiarities of the 2011 protests magnified the insurrectionist momentum, led rebels to arm themselves and pushed the anti-Qaddafi militias to move towards the Tripolitan area within a week from February 15th, when the first protests were held in Benghazi.
After more than nine years of intermittent war, conflict is far from over and the prospect of peace-building and state-wide ceasefire appears aloof for the Libyan people.

Thugs in Uniform? Police Brutality in Kenya,"If there was ever a time to wake up and smell the coffee, this is it. All around the world civilians are opening their eyes to theflagrant brutalityemployed by the very people sworn to serve and protect them:the police. In part due to social media, the spirit of revolution was ignited in the United States bythe unjust murder of George Floyd.
The spark quickly spread to other countries eager to change their own systems, includingKenya. Although not the first of its kind, this murder revealed the rack and ruin of adeeply-rooted racist systemperpetuated by the police in the United States.
While police brutality in Kenya is not necessarily racial, it is nonetheless as brutal, and as systemic, as in the US, prevailing as a result of the inherent foundation and sustenance of the institutions themselves.
Police brutality in Kenya took an unpleasant turn when the government implemented adusk-till-dawn curfewon the 27th March to contain the spread of Covid-19. The police took curfew enforcement to unforeseen levels when they began usingexcessive force and violenceon those caught violating the new rules. Civilians were battered, shot at, and imprudently attacked with tear gas. Soon after, the police were proving to be a bigger threat to Kenyans than the virus itself, theHuman Rights Watch reporting six deaths within the first ten days of the curfew.
The police have also been accused of additionalmalpractice and abuse of powerthroughextortionof civilians, as well assexual abuseof both men and women being held in the cells. Most odiously, was therape of a 15-year-old girl who sought refuge at the police stationafter escaping an abusive home.
Although Kenyans voiced their outrage at the situation at its conception primarily through social media protesting, the civil movements in the United States may have encouraged Kenyans to push again. Following rejuvenated criticism, theIndependent Policing Oversight Authority(IPOA) (the only authority overseeing the police)has received 87 complaints in two months, 21 of which for people who have died at the hands of the police. 16 officers have allegedly been held accountable, which would be a step in the right direction.
Moreover, a dialogue onhow to reform the police systemin Kenya has been initiated with a Police Reform Working Group, which hopes to reform the system from the inside-out.
With civil protests currently brewing amidst the escalation of Covid-19 in the country, only time will tell whether, just like in the US, Kenyans will run out of patience; their discontent forcing them to the streets to demand what is so rightfully theirs: concrete accountability, and a renewal of the breached social contract.

L’Espansionismo Turco in Africa: il Caso della Somalia,"La liberazione della cooperante italiana Silvia Romano, rapita in Kenya da terroristi di al-Shabaab nel Novembre 2018 e liberata in Somalia il 9 Maggio 2020, ha messo in risaltoil ruolo della Turchia nel Corno d’Africa, i servizi segreti turchi sono infatti risultati fondamentali nella buona riuscita dell’operazione.
La Turchia anno dopo anno sta consolidando la sua influenza in Africa, il Paese più rappresentativo di questo processo è laSomalia.
La storia dell’avvicinamento tra Turchia e Somalia ha inizio nel2011, anno che che vede la Somalia vittima di unaterribile carestia; tra l’indifferenza generale la Turchia si fa avanti, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visita nello stesso anno la capitale Mogadiscio, accompagnato da moglie e figlia,garantendo aiuti ed investimenti, che si concretizzeranno nella costruzione di strade, ospedali ed altre importanti infrastrutture.
E’ il primo e fondamentale passo di una collaborazione sempre più stretta, che prosegue conl’apertura nel 2016 dell’ambasciata turca a Mogadiscio, la più grande sede diplomatica turca in tutto il continente africano, e nel 2017, con l’inaugurazione sempre nella capitale somala di una base militare, dove i militari turchi addestrano i soldati somali impegnati nella lotta ai terroristi di al-Shabaab.
Misure ed investimenti, questi, che vanno inquadrati nelle politiche che Ankara sta portando avanti dall’insediamento delPartito della Giustizia e dello Svilupponel 2003,politichedagli esperti definite“neo ottomane”, che si concretizzano in una azione esterna sempre più assertiva, volta adaumentare le alleanze strategiche turche, specialmente nei territori, come la Somalia, che un tempo erano controllati dalla Sublime Porta.
Elemento cruciale in questo processo sono gli strumenti disoft powerpropri della Turchia, su tutti l’elemento della fede musulmana, utilizzata per instaurare ottime relazione con i Paesi a maggioranza islamica.
Quella della Somalia è stata una scelta molto precisa da parte della Turchia comepartnershipstrategica: uno Stato fragile come quello somalo risulta facile da influenzare, grazie ai legami economici e religiosi, la sua posizione geografica strategica sul Golfo di Aden, inoltre, offre alla Turchia una postazione privilegiata in una zona densa di traffici marittimi, con l’obiettivo di contrastare i rivali dell’Arabia Saudita e degli Emirati Arabi Uniti.
Nel Gennaio 2020 Erdoğan ha annunciato di aver accettato l’offerta somala riguardante la possibilità diesplorare risorse energetiche presenti nei territori della Somalia, decisione che mette in questo modo in luce la lungimiranza dell’operato del capo di stato turco in materia di politica estera.

[Analysis] China-Japan: Ping-Pong Diplomacy in the East China Sea,"Ping-pong is among the most popular sports in East Asia, so much so that it seems to have become a lifestyle considering that, at times, countries in the region engage in international affairs as if they were playing a match of ping-pong.
The expression ‘ping-pong diplomacy‘ becomes increasingly significant in the 1970s, whenChina and the U.S.meet at a ping-pong table for the first time after decades of silence and separation, to symbolize the start of a new friendship.
Interestingly enough, this approach to politics seems to bea favorite choice when it comes to Chinese Foreign Policy. Tensions that surround the countries both in-land and at sea, such as the South China Sea issue and the Tibetan issue, are only a few of the multiple examples that emphasize China’s predilection toalternate its soft power to moments of greater pressurewith complicated neighbors.
Events in the East China Sea, however, appear to slightly lack focus in the journalistic literature. When discussing Sino-Japanese relations, in fact, it is likely for other topics to emerge first, since there is little widespread knowledge about tensions in the Western Pacific Ocean.
There, Japan has magnificent islands that detain a huge quantity of natural resources, considered inestimable. Mostly gathered in the East China Sea, islands belonging to the Okinawa Prefecture are incredible sources of revenue for the touristic sector, but are unfortunately situated in an area that has been heavily contended between China Mainland and Japan for centuries.
The East China Sea borders withJapan(through its Southern Prefectures and the Ryukyu Islands),Taiwan(China), the eastern coast of thePeople’s Republic of China, andSouth Korea. The main disputes over maritime territories however, have involved China Mainland and Japan,both claiming the Senkaku Islands (or Diaoyu Islands, in Mandarin Chinese). The rationale behind these claims is due to thepresence of potential oil reservesclose to Senkaku.
While the Japanese official news,The Asahi Shimbun, has reported the willingness of the Japanese tosell out or rent out uninhabited islands in the East China Sea,tensions with China keep growing due to multiple interventions done by the U.S. backing Japan.
It is no news, in fact, that Japan might have a certain habit to vacillate between the fine line ofdiplomatic legitimacyandreal estate business. Back in 2012, a member of the Japanese government had made a2-billion-yen purchase of three uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, creating overwhelming social unrest among Chinese public opinion, compelling its government to send the military immediately.
Sources have frequently reported that tensions in the Senkaku Islands often view the navy or air-force of both China and Japan monitoring the area, thankfully barely ever reaching an armed conflict.The Guardianhas reported that there might be‘daily patrols to the Senkakus, a trip of five or six hours each way, with teams on standby to show up in greater force’.
Naval ships and aircrafts are fully equipped with heavy weapons; however, it ishighly improbable either government is ever going to risk a warbetween the two major polities in East Asia. Such ‘cold’ confrontation has been going on for so long that, if either country had exclusive intentions in the disputed zone, war would have not been put on pause.
Japan and China may be very different from multiple ideological, social, and political perspectives, however, they are united by a strong sense ofEast Asian identity. They extensively engage with the regional economy both together and individually. China and Japan collaborate yearly with Southeast Asian countries in theASEAN+3 mechanismand value their strong economic trio with South Korea. Japan, which has a rather pacific attitude in international affairs, also understands that China has far bigger concerns that are more desirably solvable compared to the issue in the East China Sea.
In fact, theSouth China Sea seems to constitute a similar problem on a much larger scalethat China has to address. The maritime territories in the South of China involve theclaims of multiple angry actorsthat are convinced Chinese claims expand the PRC’s borders too generously.
None of the countries bordering the East or South China Sea however, is likely to start a serious conflict with such an emerging power, but rather utilize trade and economic sanctions to invigilate Chinese behavior at sea. China and Japan are both extremely powerful in the region and both believe their approach to diplomacy is more appropriate than the other’s, but it is unlikely that they will allow any type of conflict that could weaken them both individually and as Asian regional leaders. While Japan may be an ally of the U.S., it does not enjoy its intervention in Asia and, like China, agrees that‘Asia is for the Asians’.
The possible solutions to the East China Sea dispute remain debatable. Surely, it will still take decades before either China or Japan decide to give in a share of the territories. This is an extremely delicate issue which however, is extremely valuable as it invites the international reader to reflect on China’s soft power and legitimacy over territories in the region.","June 20, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/ping-pong-diplomacy/,The New Global Order,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Tension At The Border Between India and China,"India and China areface-to-facealong the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a militarised border between the two most populated countries in the world that dates back to 1959.The Indian Expressexplains the origin of this dispute: the demarcation is considered to be 3,488 km long by India and 2,000 km by China.
The line traverses Ladakh and four Indian states: Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh; but also Tibet Autonomous Region shares borders withIndia. A key territory that makes the India-China relationship more complicated isAksai Chin: under Chinese control but claimed by India as a part of the Indian Union territory of Ladakh.
Contrary to the Line of Control (LOC) that separates India and Pakistan, borders with the recognition from both sides and according to what was established through theSimla Agreement in 1972, the Line of Actual Control is rather an “oral agreement”.
The “oral agreement” is based on alettersent by the then Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai to the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. In his letter, the Chinese PM referred to the LAC asthe border defined by the so-called McMahon Line. Following the Sino-Indian war in 1962, Zhoun Enlai, after claiming that troops had withdrawn 20 km from the LAC, added:
“To put it concretely,in the eastern sectorit coincides in the main with the so-calledMcMahon Line, and in the western and middle sectors it coincides in the main with thetraditional customary linewhich has consistently been pointed out by China”.
The McMahon Line was negotiated in the absence of China between Tibetan representatives and Great Britain during the Simla Conference (1913-1914) and named after the chief British negotiator, Sir Henry McMahon.
A further reference to the LAC was recorded in 1993 whenIndiaand China signed the “Border Peace and Tranquillity Agreement” (BPTA), the first legal agreement that cited the boundaries between the two Asian giants. This agreement, however, did not specify what the real meaning and extent of the border was. Since then, there have been some scuffles, the most recent and important of which happened in 2017, when the two counterparts were in astandofffor two months. It took place in Doklam, a tri-junction area,  lying between China, India and Bhutan.
After three more years,tension broke out in May 2020 along the Himalayas, with Beijing and New Delhi accusing each other of overstepping the LAC. The current standoff is nearGalwan valleyin Ladakh, where theIndian government started to build a bridgeand afeeder roadto link with Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road, running very close to the LAC.
On the other hand, China’s suspicious attitude has led to anincrease in troops along the border including with minor confrontations. These confrontations took place on 5thand 9thMay, and resulted in 76 Indian soldiers being injured.
Currently, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping seem to have agreed upon with a peacefully resolution, despite Ms. Rao, the former Foreign Secretary, considering the dispute as unsettled:
“If a problem has lasted so long, and there is no settlement in sight,we may need another generation or two to settle it.”
Ms. Rao might be right: on 15th June,three Indian soldiers were killedduring the increasing tension between the two nuclear powers. Both armies claimed casualties, but the actual numbers remain uncertain.
In these days, the loss of 20 Indian soldiers has caused awave of anger and grief nationwide. Surely the situation is tense. Indian Defence Minister Rjnath Singh has already made it clear that “India is no longer a weak nation, its power has increased. But we do not want to use this strength to frighten anyone.It is only to secure our country.” The Minister suggested to hit them where it hurts most:the economy.

Protesting for Change – A Conversation with Caroline Skye Grossman,"The murder of George Floydwas one of the numerous cases of police brutality towards African-American people. This specific case seems to have raised unprecedented awareness about racism and initiated a series of protests under the slogan “black lives matter.” TNGO political analystAurora Ceccottiinterviewed Caroline Skye Grossman, who explains what it is like to actively take part of this movement, protesting in the streets of New York.
Aurora:Why did you decide to join the protests?
Caroline: I decided to join the protests because even though there is a global pandemic happening and New York is the epicenter of it, I think the number of cases of Coronavirus will eventually dwindle, butracism against Black peoplehas been a pandemic in this country for centuries. Because it has been going on for so long despite people recognizing the need for and mentioning change, no change has actually happened. That being said, I wanted to be a part of this change. Racism has been happening in this country for too long.
Aurora:The Department of Small Businesses Services in New York estimated that circa 450 businesses were vandalized and looted between May and June. What impact did have looters on the protests?
Caroline:In terms of the effects the looters has on the NYC protests, I think because most of the looting happened at night after dark, Mayor De Blasio issued an8:00 PM curfew in the city. This is ironic because his daughter was arrested protesting – the news even claims she was “looting”. Last week, the 8pm curfew was lifted because not enough people were following it and it put essential workers that work later hours at risk. This decreased some looting, but did not stop it; the number of arrests increased and the number of violent arrests conducted by NYPD (ed.New York Police Department), in my view, increased.
Aurora:Have you ever felt unsafe during the demonstrations?
Caroline:Personally, I have never felt unsafe during the demonstrations. This is probably because I maintained the 8 PM curfew while protesting, and attended morepeaceful protestsin uptown Manhattan like a Vigil on East End Avenue, and a march along Central Park West, while also encountering some closer to midtown that were peaceful. Whereas downtown Manhattan near Union Square and entering Brooklyn, there were more violent in terms of looting. I was able to feel safe wearing a KN-95 mask and I did not come into physical contact with anyone.
Aurora:Have you ever witnessed forms of police brutality? Has tear gas been used?
Caroline:I personally haven’t witnessed any forms of police brutality or tear gas because I attended more peaceful protests, but I am aware of the phenomenon and know people that have witnessed or been faced with tear gas orpolice brutality.
Aurora:Are people taking any measures to prevent afurther spread of Covid?
Caroline:I would say people are somewhat taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 because everyone is wearing masks and many people wear gloves at the protests. However, people areno longer quarantining at homeas much as they used to, and most protesters cannot social distance by maintaining a 6 feet from one another. Cases in NYC have flattened though and there is no longer an officialStay at Homeorder, so it is safer now.
Aurora:What do you expect the outcome of the protests will be? Will there be a radical, institutional change?
Caroline:I think that, because there are protests around the country and the world, there has to be some sort ofinstitutional change. I have seen people standing up to this injustice that don’t normally speak out about injustices, which is saying a lot; and I think everyone standing up to racism is what it takes to foster change and dismantle the system. It’s not white against Black or Democrat against Republican,it’s everyone against racism.
Aurora:How has governor Cuomo’s approach towards the fight for civil right impacted the intensity of the protests?
Caroline:Governor Cuomo does an acceptable job approaching the protests. Herecognizes the need for protestingduring the current political climate and I think that’s important.
Aurora:What do you think about president Trump’s response to the protests?
Caroline:I think President Trump has inappropriate and irresponsible responses to protests. He feeds to the racism against Black people by the words he use to describe looters. I have read his tweets and seen him interviewed and he calls them “thugs“ and “hoodlums“, which are both not appropriate, especially coming from the President. His job as a leader is to help dismantle the racist system instead of feeding to it.
….These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!
Aurora:Any final thoughts?
Caroline:Overall, it is so great to see so many people protesting and standing up to these injustices from all places and backgrounds, especially during a global pandemic. Of course, in this day an age, there are so many other ways to stand up too for those that are unable to protest.

Few days ago,Romania passed a law to ban gender identity studies, considered by Reuters as putting the country on the same authoritarian tracks as Hungary and Poland, and it explains the comparison:
“in Hungary, lawmakers voted last month to ban transgender people from changing their gender on identity documents, while Polish President Andrzej Duda Poland this week compared LGBT “ideology” to communist doctrine in an election campaign speech”.
Conversely, in US, the Supreme Court ruled thatTitle VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 covers also cases of anti-discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
First of all, the Civil Rights Act was proposed by President John F. Kennedy to ensure constitutional rights for African Americans and other minority groups in US, but after his premature death, the law was implemented by President Lyndon Johnson.
Title VII concernsEqual Employment Opportunity Definitionsand defines as unlawful the discrimination on the workplace on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex or national origin. The nation’s top court decided that people cannot be fired or discriminated against for being gay or transgender; thus “sex” has he broader meaning to include sexual orientation and gender identity.
As reported byUn News:
“The court’s decision was issued in relation tothree cases: Gerald Bostock, who was fired from a county job in the United States state of Georgia after he joined a gay softball team; Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor who was fired after disclosing he was gay to a client; and Aimée Stephens, who was fired from her job at a Michigan funeral home two weeks after telling her boss she intended to live full-time as a woman.”
Victor Madrigal-Borloz, UN Independent Expert protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, considers the judgement as a step up inaddressing stigma and promoting inclusion.
But, as we have seen, LGBT+ rights are not protected everywhere at any time.
Even if WHO on 17th May 1990 declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder and that specific date is now used to celebrateThe International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT),the challenges remain:same-sex relations are illegal in 70 countries around the world, mostly African countries.
In Iran,Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Nigeria, Sudan and Somalia consensual same-sex sexual acts are punishable by death penalty. Another 26 nations impose maximum penalties for same-sex sexual relations of between 10 years and life imprisonment. Homosexual intercourse between adults is legalin 123 of the 193 member statesof the United Nations. Countries that have most recentlydecriminalisedhomosexuality included Botswana, Angola and India.
To Sarah and to all persons that are fighting: you are not alone. Thank you for your bravery, your fight and your pride.
“All human beings are bornfreeandequalin dignity and rights.”

"Donald Trump, the US Army and Germany: What is really going on?","The USA continues to declare itself as a global superpower as well as the leader and protector of the free world. As the biggest economic power and a country committed to keeping its interests safe globally, why are they planning to withdraw troops from Germany, and also, why are US troops there in the first place?
The USA boasts havingmilitary personnel worldwidein their long-term mission to defend and spread democracy. In the case of Germany, the latest Defense Manpower Data Center figures tell us that there are 34,674 U.S. service members present.
This number is second only to Japan, where the US hosts 55,165. These are huge numbers for two of the biggest democracies in the world, butwhy are the troops even there?
Since the end of World War Two in 1945, the USA have had a military presence in Germany. In the 10-years following the end of the war, the US armed forces were part of an allied occupation of the country, helping to rebuild the country in the aftermath of the war and install some form of stability following the devastation that the country faced.
Since then, troops have dwindled in numbers but have remained ever-present. This is partly due to theestablishment of EUCOM, the United States European Command, in 1952, headquartered in Stuttgart. This mark of commitment and strategic importance must not be forgotten when listening to Trump’s withdrawal threats and countless rants about NATO.
Whilst Trump suggests that the presence of US troops is largely down to protecting Germany as a member of NATO and ensuring stability in Europe, realistically it is of the US’ interests to position troops there. Without their troops in Germany, US force projection would be difficult with depleted staff at EUCOM and across Germany and some operations would be impossible, especially with the USA’s vested interests in the Middle East and suspicions of countries further afield, including China and North Korea to name a few.
To top it all off, the US presence in Germany even famously once boasted a youngElvis Presleyamongst their ranks in 1958, giving a concert to the people at the base of Grafenwoehr: ever the performer for the big stage, much like the incumbent President!
President Trump’s announcement thathe plans to withdraw 9,500 US troopsby September is all based on defence spending amongst theNATOmember states and his attempt to influence other countries internal politics.
Trump has long argued that European members of NATO need to spend more money on their defence and that they can’t rely on the US to bail them out in tricky situations or or do their part to escalate conflicts further. In recent days, Trump has labelled Germany as being “delinquent” in its payments to NATO, whilst also being bad trade partners, arguing that:
“They’ve cost the United Stateshundreds of billions of dollarsover the years on trade, so we get hurt on trade and we get hurt on Nato”
Much of this criticism isunfounded, with NATO members agreeing to commit 2% of their GDP on defence spending by 2024, giving Germany and the rest of NATO’s member states four more years, or conveniently until the end of what could be Trump’s second term, to achieve this objective. Germany have though signalled that they hope to reach this targetby 2031and with the COVID-19 crisis this target may even be ambitious for a country priding itself on stability and a strong economy.
Utter this quietly but maybe Trump does have a point, although there are far more important issues to face now with the world facing a global recession in light of COVID-19 and the need to keep people in work across the world. Perhaps now is the time for Trump to put a lid on his boiling pot full of anger towards NATO.
But we have seen these kinds of charades from President Trump before. Since taking office, Trump has threatened towithdraw troops from Japan and South Koreafor financial reasons and has consistently moaned about fellow NATO member states. Only time will tell, but with only 15% of Germans believing that the US bases in Germany were very important and his lack of action on previous threats, Trump’s latest power play may not have a great impact at all.

[Analysis] Hong Kong vs Singapore: Competing Asian Tigers,"Hong Kong (SAR, China) and Singapore are two of the four Asian Tigers that keep driving the economy of theAsia-Pacific regiontowards significant development. Whilst they hold many similarities to Western economies, they remain special due to their small size and dense populations that work day and night to push socio-economic progress.
Together withTaiwanandSouth Korea, economists have often considered the four part of “The East Asian Miracle”, due to their rapidly industrialising economies that have now made it into the category of ‘high-income country’. By the early 2000’s, in fact, both Hong Kong and Singapore heldleading financial and business hubs of Asia, specialising in areas of competitive advantage that benefited the services sector greatly.
Taken as role economic models for other regional developing economies, the “Tiger Cubs” experts continue to study theirexport-oriented, welfare, and tax policiesin order to understand the phenomenon that concerned their rapid development and the implications this may have in the future.
These two city-states have often been compared due to their similar GDP per capita, low poverty rate, low unemployment rate, and explosive services sectors. Recent data from the World Bank Database is gathered in a table above demarcating these similarities.
As shown, the Chinese Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong occupies a bigger territory and hosts a greater population, however, Singapore remains the wealthiest of the two, presenting a rather balanced economy that values the importance of the industrial sector.Hong Kongis positioned strategically geo-politically, allowing it to communicate with the Chinese industrial cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Its economic focus may for this reason be fully shifted towards the services sector. Among the many factors contributing to its development, one can indicate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Import-Export as the most prominent.
However, the historical and political contexts these powers have grown in are leading them to separate destinies. Often,Singaporehas been described as a rather independent and complete economy, whereas Hong Kong seems to be increasingly relying on the People’s Republic of China.
The name given to the city-state of Singapore originates from the Malay “Singapura” – the “Lion City.” This animal – also known as “The Merlion” – is frequent in the ancient history of Singapore, and symbolises the calm and wiseness of its inhabitants in fighting against evil creatures in the sea. Hence why, the lion is often portrayed with the body of a fish, roaring towards the sea.
It is possible that the semiotics related to the Merlion gather influence from Malaysian culture as well as from British colonisation irrupting repeatedly in the 1920’s, until establishing the Colony of Singapore, lasting from 1946 to 1963. It is in 1965, when Singapore became an independent Republic, the island started employing all its resources and strategic position (just between Asia and Oceania) to push for progress.
A friendly Giant Panda, instead, kept observing from the North. Coming from a painful history of viewing the British and Mainland Chinese constantly contending for its land, the national symbol of Hong Kong – the Giant Panda – portrays a rather calm and silenced reality suffered by the Hong Kong population until recent protests in 2019.
Hong Kong, unlike Singapore, was never able to proclaim independence. Despite the outstanding economic development it has undergone since the end of 1990, the Giant Panda of Hong Kong still seems to have a hard time convincing the Dragon (the PRC) that it should leave the Pandas alone.
Politics-wise, Singapore and Hong Kong are at opposite extremes. Singapore is governed by a Westminster-like democracy, whereas it is the Chinese Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China that monitors the Special Administrative Region. While Hong Kong has some degree of freedom in executive powers just like Macao and other SARs in China, the Mainland government keeps a tight grip on Hong Kong’s territory. This is especially visible in 2020, when the Chinese government imposed the National Security Law in response to local protests.
Even if Singapore is effectively a capitalist economy, just like the United Kingdom, experts often tend to highlight that, in reality, the Singaporean government has an incredible amount of power. The State, in fact,owns about 90% of the land, and state-owned enterprises provide 80% of the available housing. It is no surprise, therefore, that Singapore has been rated among the highest in Asia for government effectiveness, rule of law andcorruption control. However, due to struggles with lacking human rights and civil liberties, sources such asThe Economist Intelligence Unitconsider Singapore a “flawed democracy” (2019 data).
Therefore, one would easily think that, being governed by a former Communist State, Hong Kong’s soil is similarly state-owned. However, the central Chinese Communist Party only intervenes on matters that are considered of crushing importance or that are related to the sovereignty of China. The daily decision-making, instead, seems to be trusted in the hands oflocal tycoons: families with overwhelming political and economic power in Hong Kong.
These famous “Crazy Rich Asians” include holders of Swire Pacific, Galaxy Entertainment Group, and Jardine Matheson Holdings. According to economist Andy Xie in aninterview with CNBC, “The Hong Kong government is not really in charge (even though) most people think that they need to listen to Beijing, but perhaps more importantly, they are really influenced by the big property tycoons.” In fact, one of the latest news reports concerning the National Security Law, stated that the tycoons reunited to put their names behind the law, so that the Chinese government would approve to discuss with them how torelocate a wealth summing up to $140 billionUSD in safety.
The political structures of these systems, therefore, go beyond the conventional assumptions of how decision-making processes occur in seemingly democratic or socialist marketized systems. Both Singapore and Hong Kong are extremely unique in this sense, and such peculiarities, of course, do not only shape domestic politics but also inevitably their economic structures.
Export and Foreign Direct Investment certainly have a leading role in the economic structures of these Asian Tigers, however, they present major divergences in the manufacturing sector. As reported from the table at the beginning of this analysis, the industry occupies a larger share of GDP in Singapore compared to its Hong Kong counterpart.
Data shows thatmanufacturingin this city represents less than 8% of the GDP, and that this depends heavily on the low costs that South China can offer. The whole area of Guangdong (known as Canton province) concentrates an enormous amount of manufacturers, that produce goods to then ship them all over the world. Luckily enough, Hong Kong is just around the corner and can commission these manufacturers to sell goods at a lower price.
From this point of view, Hong Kong is heavily reliant on China and, in the case that it would be granted independence, it is unclear how its economic model would change. The primary, secondary and tertiary sectors seem unbalanced, therefore Hong Kong would be compelled to keep friendly ties with China despite political differences.
On the other hand, manufacturing in Singapore has always represented around 20% of the GDP, maintaining thestrategy to diversify the economysteady over time. Singapore has strong ties with China, yet its exports are much more significant with other powers such as ASEAN, the EU, and the US. This may be related to the fact goods and services provided by this Republic are rather expensive because, as a unitary economy, Singapore must be self-reliant. Therefore, China would choose to import the same products at lower costs from developing countries in Southeast Asia.
This, however, does not exclude that Singapore is dependent on the global market’s volatility. This small economy is powerful and does influence the world’s economy at its best, but globalization still exposes Singapore to risks and challenges that vary according to external variations in all sectors.
The similarities between the economic models have often escalated in a healthy competition, testing the capabilities of their structures and eventually emphasizing emerging weaknesses. In an everlasting race that sees Singapore and Hong Kong alternating the pole position over the decades, there appears to be no supreme winner. However, as of 2020, the media highlights that it may in fact be Singapore holding first place, gaining ground against Hong Kong in many aspects.
The ongoing protests and Coronavirus outbreak certainly brought very few benefits to Hong Kong’s economy. According to the South China Morning Post, investors complain that theyneed more harmony in the city and that political instability creates an enormous obstacle, holding back businesses and enterprises rather than encouraging their growth. The recent pandemic has proven that Hong Kong, relying on the tertiary sector, cannot make it on its own in case of external shocks orforce majeure. Below, a video by the South China Morning Post explains these implications in detail.
Contrarily, Singapore might have been gaining from these losses. As reported by CGTN and by the President of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong,46% of companies are pessimistic about Hong Kong’s future, and 24% have chosen to move their companies overseas– Singapore being their top choice. An estimation by Goldman Sachs also predicts that around $4 billion USD has been fluctuating from Hong Kong directly into Singapore’s pockets since April.
Despite the inevitable benefits the global condition is bringing to this city, however, it is important to mention that Singapore also has no interest in losing Hong Kong as powerful Asian Tiger or as a direct rival. Competitiveness is surely held at a tough level, but Singapore needs its close neighbour to drive regionalism jointly in East Asia. As explained by the Minister for Trade and Industry, Chan Chun Sing, Singapore needs Hong Kong as an economic partner, and its increasing instability not only threatens the population in Hong Kong, but East Asia as a whole.
As for future prospects, Singapore must expect talent migrating from Hong Kong, with young educated people who begin searching there for more valuable job opportunities. However, with population density being a big problem in Singapore, the government might also impose a severe selection process for incoming individuals.
Coronavirus, unfortunately, affected all world economies and Singapore will have its own struggles to overcome. What will occur in the next months is hard to say, but it is very likely competition will continue regardless of the future political status quo of these cities.","July 04, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-hong-kong-vs-singapore-competing-asian-tigers/,The New Global Order,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Young Overseas Chinese and the Identity Quest – A Conversation with Sally Lin,"In the article, TNGO writerRebecca Marighellaconducts an interview with Sally Lin, a first-generation Chinese immigrant who lives and studies in British Columbia, Canadato talk about the phenomenon of the “Chinese Diaspora.”
The Chinese Diaspora is an ongoing phenomenon that has long seen ethnic Chinese groups migrate from mainland China to other parts of the world. While the politically correct term used to identify these groups is “Overseas Chinese“, the term “diaspora” originates from the Bible, referring to the mass migration of the Jews towards a land – Palestine – they believed was promised to them by God.
Today, this territory is politically recognised as Israel and has become theatre to one of the most complicated and saddening conflicts in history, seeing Palestinians slowly lose their own homeland. Aside from this example, however, the majority of these waves of migration occurring worldwide have been peaceful, and heavily depended on thechallenging socioeconomic situationsthat groups of migrants faced in their countries of provenance. Among these waves is the Italian Diaspora of the early 1900’s and the Chinese Diaspora of the post-Mao era.
China is the world’s most populous country, with a population of1.4 billion. However, to think that another50 million(2018 est.) Chinese live overseas only makes this data more incredible. According to theChinese Journal of Sociology(article by scholars Dudley L Poston Jr and Juyin Helen Wong), in 2011 these groups were already spread across 148 countries, with the top 10 destinations all being in South East Asia. In fact, countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore are well-known for representing a large ethnic Chinese group in their national demographics. Below, a map shows the distribution of Overseas Chinese worldwide.
In Canada, ethnic Chinese account for 5% of the population and, according to the latest2016 Canadian Census, this percentage amounts to1.7 millioncivilians. While Canada is currently considered a country very welcoming to migrants and, in general, kind towards foreigners, it is important to remind our readers that its history is far more complex than that, and has seen the population of indigenous peoplesuffer extensivelyunder the illegitimate rule of European settlers.
The first Chinese wave relocating toCanadahad already set off in the 19th century, concentrating in the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Once there, they worked tirelessly for all kinds of on-field labours whilst unfortunately being subjected toprolific racial discrimination. It is only after decades of hardships that this wave was able to begin integrating into Canadian culture and society.
From the ’70s onward, waves of migration from China tended to involve these migrants belonging to anincreasingly wealthy social classwhich would then start making an impact on Canadian activities of commerce, business, and the services sector. In cities like Vancouver, many ethnic Chinese are owners of enterprises or small businesses. Below, a video by the Government of British Columbia explains the importance of opening the first Chinese Canadian Museum and recounting the history of this group.
TheBlack Lives Mattermovement of 2020 hasreopened conversations about identity, race and discriminationas issues that are still unresolved in the U.S. as well as worldwide. With a focus on the Asia-Pacific region, The New Global Order has chosen the Chinese Diaspora to widen this conversation and focus on the group of ethnic Chinese, unjustly thrown in the midst due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
In this article, TNGO is honored to be able to recount theHuman Storyof an exceptional Chinese Canadian,Sally Lin, who can be considered the ultimate example as to why groups of “identity-mixed” people add so much value to our world.
What does it mean to be a migrant?Andwhere does a migrant’s home belong?
These arefundamental and extremely intimate questionsthat should be asked before labeling a person “Canadian”, “Chinese” or “Italian”. Many argue thatpeople are made by the experiences that shape them rather than where they were born.
Sally is an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia, completing her B.A. Political Science and Human Geography. Moving with her parents to Canada when she was only two years old, Sally considers herself a first-generation immigrant who has gone through thedifficult battle of searching for the fine line between ethnicity and identity. The One-Child Policy in China conflicted with her family’s plans to have another child, therefore Sally found herself on a plane that changed her destiny when she was just a toddler.
Unlike second-generation Chinese Canadians, often born on Canadian soil, Sally found herself in a completely different socio-cultural context. She told TNGO that, in Vancouver,people often struggled to pronounce her Chinese birth name– Yuyang – therefore she chose an English name to be more easily recognized.
While this is a common practice among young Chinese both in China and abroad, she believes she made it “out of pressure” and that “it isdemoralizingthat someone feels like she should change her name, because names make you as an individual”. In fact, she revealed that among the reasons why she chose the name “Sally” is that other children could have made fun of her foreign name. While this event might seem small, if one considers that these thoughts were going through the mind of a child, this only re-confirms that these stories must be told for society to change.
Buthow does Sally portray herself today?Does her identity lie with her ethnic roots or have other factors shaped who she is?
She believes “identity is something constructed by people and how they perceive you.”
“I am identified as Chinese but I view myself as Chinese Canadian. It is still hard to try and get in touch with what it means to be a first-generation immigrant because when I travel back to China I don’t feel as Chinese as my peers. (…)People in Shanghai know I am a foreigner“.
From Sally’s words, therefore, one can understand that as much as one’s family might come from a certain culture or identify with a certain community,individuals can evolve their identitybeyond the boundaries tying them to their ethnicity.
Whilst Sally loves the Chinese traditional customs of cooking and enjoying a rich meal with her loved ones sharing everything on a round table, another side to her is very patriotic at UBC and loves the atmosphere in Vancouver. This, however, does not go without difficulties. The questions concerning where her home is and where her heart lies are always in the back of her mind. As Sally says, she is tied to people rather than places, therefore her home is wherever the people she loves may be. From time to time, she rediscovers the role of Chinese culture in her life thanks to long journeys overseas.
The woman she is today, however, also comes from a place whereher identity was impacted by racial discrimination. According to her recounts, in her early years of university, people would try to guess the country she was from. Benefiting since young from her Canadian citizenship, this was extremely offensive to her. While North America is often viewed as a culturally-mixed place, indeed, events like the BLM movement have shown the world that there are many underlying problems with how society is structured and that there might be a preference for certain ethnic groups at the expense of others. When asked about how she is living this difficult time during the pandemic, Sally stated that “COVID-19 brought a lot of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian racism. In Canada and the Western world,the general public tend to believe Asians are the perfect type of immigrant because they work hard and stick to the rules, but when something concerning China occurs, Chinese are also quickly pointed a finger at“. She adds that this generalization, or the belief that “All Asians are hard-working”, comes from the dominant narrative concerning wealthier Asians, being the Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans. “What about other communities in Southeast Asia?” she asks, clearly concerned about these stereotypes.
When asked about her opinion on the death of George Floyd in the U.S., she claimed that the Asian community in North America felt overall outraged becauseone of the policemen responsible for his killing was Asian. Many, she says, were worried this would bring around new stereotypes and generalisations about her community, on top of the offences already received after Covid-19 started spreading from Mainland China. As long as only a small group of individuals believe this, the harm is minimised, but the fact that one of the world’s most important governments – the Trump Administration – made comments about this being a “Chinese Virus”, made the Chinese community in North Americafeel unsafe in their own homes.
Sally, on her side, believes these events emphasize on along history of white supremacismthat is no longer acceptable in the U.S., Canada, and worldwide. She claims that “With BLM, I noticed my family may have certain prejudices on ethnic groups that are different from ours and I value having a chat with them about this. Conversations are important, and should be had at this time in every familyso that we can start over when our children will be born“. Ultimately, she thinks that, in Canada, the history of what happened to the native population should be prioritized in education, to recognize that racial discrimination is an issue that must be eradicated.
We thank Sally again for her contribution to The New Global Order, and we invite our readers to keep informed about theanti-racism movementsgoing on worldwide and make an impact where possible.

Why Colonialism in Education Benefits the Working Class,"History is undeniable; it is the lifeblood of every institution, family, industry, and country today.Failing to learn about our history massively disadvantages our opportunities for progression. Failing to educate the general public about the reality of empire, the reality of Britain’s past, the reality of ex-colonies’ present, all enables groups within the population to reminisce about an era when they were ‘powerful’ or when ‘life was better’ –a plain-faced lie.Core topics in the U.K. educational curriculum avoid teaching the general public about Britain’s long and, by contemporary standards, disgraceful history in terms of empire, genocide, war crimes, etc. in colonies. As a result the empire upon which ‘the sun never sets’ is embraced by much of today’s public:49% of Britons still think that the British Empire was a force for goodthat improved the lives of colonised nations, andonly 15% think it left them worse off,YouGovdata show.
The truth is the brutality of empire was felt to an extraordinary degree by Britain’s colonies from the 17th Century to the 20th Century. The empire began with plantations in Ireland, then settlements in North America, then (primarily sugar) plantations in the Caribbean islands and Bahamas, then onto Southern Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand and more. It is vital to know that the basis of empire for the majority of these colonies was slavery: until its’ abolition in 1807, Britain transported 3.5 million Africans to America.This equates to one third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. The British Empire was entirely dependent on slavery as the basis of the fast-growing economies of their colonies. Bristol, Glasgow and Liverpool were the homes of the most profitable slave traders and their practices in the UK.
The history of empire is a vastly important basis for our world today, and it is also, from a historical viewpoint, an extremely interesting focus for analysis, being rich with European power politics, wars, revolts, and genocide.
These are not topics we shy away from at any other point in history. WWII is emphatically taught, emphasising the grand position of the allies in defeating fascism; Henry VIII and the power-politics of earlier European empires are frequently discussed as the start of Britain’s introduction to the power stage. Failing to include empire in the core education of the public is an enormous disadvantage to not just the four billion poor because of the legacy of colonialism, not just topeople of colour suffering from socially constructed notions of racial hierarchycreated by colonists, but to the vast population who are also unknowingly suffering due to imperialist policy.The truth of colonialism is not just slavery, it is its’ economic legacy; or as Maya Goodfellow states:
“Four billion people are not poor because of some unhappy accident or an inherent failing; legacies of colonialism, extractive capitalist economies and racialised hierarchies of power produce poverty”
It is not just the war crimes and genocide, but also the truth of the vast majority of the British population living in abysmal conditions in slums, then working in labour at the dawn of industrialisation, producing manufactured goods from the raw resources cultivated by colonies. The 18th and 19th centuries are an example of disgraceful working and living conditions, and of extreme social inequality, that the majority of Britain is shaped by today. Industrial cities such as Leicester, Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham, and realistically the majority of Northern cities, will frequently see grand factories that used to be (and in some cases continue to be) home to hosiery, textiles, steel works and much more.
Now colonialism is over, these cities are faced with similar fundamental issues to ex-colonies, on a much smaller scale; the economy forced upon them by the highest classes has been swept back away from under their feet leaving abundant opportunity for progress, socially and economically, without the oppression of imperialism – but no guidance, no feasible route to make this happen.
Entire cities’, entire countries’, economies are still dependent on the exporting of raw resources (or low-value products) and on large populations of working class only made capable of working in labour (and by this I mean, disadvantaged from reaching the opportunities offered to higher classes, such as affordable higher education, or affordable living opportunities in cities where high-paying jobs are etc).Fixing this structural inequality requires it to be transparent, not for it to be purposefully hidden in the fog of ignorance through educational neglect.It is so vital, so clearly valuable to society as a whole that those ignorant of the history of colonialism realise that those complaining about its brutality are allies, not enemies.

L’acqua: fonte di vita o strumento di guerra?,"L’utilizzo dell’acquacome arma strategica diguerranon è un fenomeno del tutto nuovo, anche se si è tornati a discuterne soltanto negli ultimi anni.
Questa tattica, che oltre ad essere un’efficace strategia militare ha anche risvolti politici e psicologici, prevede ilcontrollo delle infrastrutture idrichenemiche, come dighe, pozzi, canali e bacini tramite i quali è possibile manipolare i flussi d’acqua. Bloccare le forniture idriche, deviarle, contaminarle o utilizzarle per inondare i raccolti sono metodi utili quanto meschini per colpire intere popolazioni, mettendo a rischio la lorosicurezza idrica, alimentare ed energetica e far leva sui propri nemici.
La storia è costellata di esempi che mostrano come il così detto ‘oro blu’ sia stato sfruttato come strumento di guerra per pressare gli opponenti politici o militari e raggiungere così obiettivi strategici. Si dice che, già nel 539 a.C, Ciro il Grande sia riuscito a conquistare Babilonia proprio dirottando le acque del fiume Eufrate, rendendone così più facile l’attraversamento.
Più recentemente, si è tornati a discutere di questa tematica in relazione alloStato Islamico. InIraq, il gruppo terroristico è riuscito ad impadronirsi di importanti dighe, come quella di Falluja, Ramadi, Samarra e Mosul (anche se solo per pochi giorni) ed ha ripetutamente tagliato l’acqua e l’elettricità a numerose città, in particolar modo quelle Sciite. Non meno grave è stata l’inondazione di terre fertili, come quelle nella zona di Abu Ghraib, che, oltre a provocare la perdita dei raccolti e la morte del bestiame, ha anche causato l’evacuazione di migliaia di residenti nell’area.
Dinamiche simili si sono verificate anche in passato nellaSiriadiBashar al-Assade nell’Iraq diSaddam Husseinche, negli anni ‘90, decise di drenare le paludi sud irachene per punire il popolo della sua ribellione contro il regime. Anche loYemen, dove si sta attualmente consumando una delle più gravi crisi umanitarie al mondo, vede spesso l’acqua utilizzata dai combattenti a discapito dei civili.
Caso esemplare che viene spesso trascuratoè quello della Libia, già uno dei paesi più aridi al mondo. Nonostante i ripetuti appelli delleNazioni Unitecontro l’utilizzo dell’acqua come arma di guerra, pratica vietata anche dalle convenzioni internazionali, le parti in gioco ne hanno fatto ampio uso.
Oltre ad infrastrutture decadenti, già devastate da anni di conflitti, numerosi sono stati i sabotaggi e gli attacchi alle risorse idriche. Proprio recentemente, in piena pandemia daCOVID-19, l’approvvigionamento idrico a Tripoli è stato interrotto da una milizia locale che avrebbe assaltato una stazione di controllo del complesso del GMR (Great Man-Made River, l’acquedotto più grande al mondo voluto daMuammar Gheddafi), tentando di fare pressioni per assicurarsi il rilascio di miliziani alleati diHaftar. Una circostanza analoga si era già verificata nel maggio 2019, quando un gruppo armato aveva assalito la centrale idrica di Jabal al-Hasawna, bloccando per 48 ore l’approvvigionamento idrico della capitale.
Questa situazione è resa ancor più grave dalla continua crescita demografica e dall’avanzamento deicambiamenti climatici,a cui la Libia è estremamente prona. Le limitate risorse idriche rinnovabili e le dure condizioni climaticheminacciano lo sviluppo economicodel paese, andando a intaccare la produzione agricola, fortemente basata sull’irrigazione.
In un simile contesto, l’acqua appare sempre più come un bene prezioso, che in quanto scarso genera numerose tensioni. Soprattutto nei paesi aridi dell’area medio orientale e nordafricana, dove le risorse disponibili si stanno contraendo, l’acqua è sia fonte di vita che di morte, specialmente quando usata come fonte strategica dileverage, come arma di guerra.
Lungimiranti sono state le parole pronunciate nel 1995 da Ismail Serageldin, ex vicepresidente della Banca Mondiale:
“Se le guerre del XX secolo sono state combattute per il petrolio, quelle del XXI secolo avranno come oggettol’acqua”.

The New Hong Kong’s Security Law: A Radical Policy Shift,"It “spells the death knell forHong Kong”.These were the wordswhich Jimmy Lai, entrepreneur and one of the main contributors to the Hong Kong Democratic Party, used to describe the newSecurity Lawpassed by theChinese Governmenton 30th June 2020. This piece of legislation, which already raised considerable concerns and negative reactions from many international actors, will enormously increase Chinese control over the region, with the alleged goal ofcompletely silencing its political opponents.
TheNational People’s Congresshad already manifested its intentions to address the protests when, in May,it had authorisedthe NPCSC (National People’s Congress Standing Committee) to develop a national security law forHong Kong. The rationale behind this decision was to contain and suppress thegrowing calls for independence, considered by high-ranking Chinese Government officials as beingtantamount to terroristic stances.
But how will these new laws concretely affect Hong Kong’s citizens? The legislative text, which had been kept secret from the public until after it came into effect, is composed of 66 articles covering a vast array of different topics and circumstances. Some of the most worrisome passages, it is argued, will completelysilence freedom of speechand cancel any semblance of checks and balances in the region. The new law includesthe following provisions:
The first and harshest reactions to the adoption of such radical legislation came from the leading figures within the pan-democracy camp.Demosisto, the pro-democracy political organisation led byJoshua WongandAgnes Chow, which played a crucial part in the 2014Umbrella Revolutionand aimed at obtaining autonomy for Hong Kong,had its leadership resigning and was dismantledimmediately after the Security Law’s approval. Wong himself justified this decision by expressing his worries on the concerning scenarios faced by Beijing’s opponents, and on howthe new law would put at risk their very lives and personal safety.
Many other international actors manifested their concerns regarding Beijing’s decision.Mike Pompeo, theUS Secretary of State,firmly attacked the lawby describing it as “draconian” and “destroying the territory’s autonomy”. More than this, he denounced the Chinese Government for its unwillingness to respect its commitments and forviolating agreementstaken in several international organisations. Finally, he stated that, to oppose these decisions, the United States will not only maintain the already adopted visa restrictions on CCP officials but will alsocancel most of the policy exemptions currently granting a particularly favourable treatment to Hong Kong.
Milder, but nevertheless perturbed wordswere also expressed by the High Representativeon behalf of theEuropean Union. His statement highlighted the troubling methods employed by China to develop the new legislation as well as the detrimental effects that it will have over the rights of Hong Kong’s citizens. At the same time, it also pointed out that the EU will continue to monitor the situation in the region, especially given the upcoming elections for the Legislative Council, which will take place on the 6th September.
Another international actor who, in the past months, had already been fairly vocal about its perturbation with the current situation in Hong Kong was, understandably,theUnited Kingdom. The Foreign Secretary,Dominic Raab, describedthe Chinese decision as “a grave step” and reiterated the intention to see through the already discussed plan to modify visa regulations to grant Hong Kong’s citizens a way to obtain theUK citizenship.
China’s responses to these accusations and reactions have been focused on expressing how a security law for Hong Kong was a long-needed one and that it will achieve the goal ofbringing back stability within the region. High-ranking Beijing’s officers have repeatedly downplayed the actual number of individuals who will be punished by the new provisions, as they will allegedly target only“a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security”.
As these disputes took place at the international level, in Hong Kong, the protestersadapted themselvesto the Security Law. In an attempt to avoid the usage of pro-democracy slogans, which could be deemed as “terroristic” and punished accordingly, activists have started to hold upblank signsas a visual representation of their opposition to Beijing’s rule.

ROAD TO NOVEMBER: Baby Boomer vs Millennials,"Nel 2016, per la prima volta negli Stati Uniti, i membri della generazione “millennials” sono stati quasi esattamente uguali ai baby boomer come percentuale di adulti che hanno diritto di voto. Secondo i dati del progetto“Nonpartisan States of Change,” i millennial (che possiamo definire come nati tra il 1981 e il 2000) hanno rappresentato il30,5 percento degli elettori idonei, praticamente corrispondenti al 30,7 percento dei baby boomer già nel 2018.
Oggi, i boomers si sono ridotti a circa il 28 percento degli elettori, mentre i millennial hanno superato oltre il 34 percento.
Poiché gli elettori più anziani hanno sempre votato in modo più affidabile di quelli più giovani, i millennial quasi certamente non saranno né più legati ad un partito né tantomeno ad una ideologia.
La transizione di questi anni sta ponendo fine a una corsa dominante per i baby boomer, l’enorme base elettorale nata tra il 1946 e il 1964, iniziata nel 1980 eguagliando gli elettori della generazione che ha combattuto la seconda guerra mondiale e li ha superati, come il più grande blocco di elettori effettivi, nel 1984.
E da quell’anno è risultata essere la più grande generazione in ogni corsa presidenziale da allora.
Ma ora i boomers stanno cedendo il passo ai millennial (e ai primi post millennial, quelli cioè nati negli anni duemila).
Questa inesorabile transizione generazionale potrebbe sollevare il Partito Democratico e sfidare i Repubblicani, se le attuali lealtà e proiezioni al voto rimarranno valide.
Tornado indietro nella storia delle elezioni americane,i baby boomer sono emersi, per la prima volta, come una forza culturalmente liberale. Formata generalmente da una popolazione bianca (80%) e che invecchiando ha preferito votare per i repubblicani (i repubblicani hanno conquistato i voti di circa tre quinti dei bianchi dai 45 ai 64 anni nel 2010, 2012 e le elezioni del 2016).
La più grande sfida per i partiti politici è il riuscire a catturare l’attenzione e il voto delle nuove generazioni.
Quindi non risulta più un essere un’opera di coinvolgimento sull’ideologia, ma sulla prestazione e sulla proposta di soluzioni per il futuro.
Un esempio sono le difficoltà economiche delle generazioni più giovani emerse già durante i due mandati di Obama, e peggiorate con i quattro anni di Trump.
Rispetto alle generazioni precedenti alla stessa età, i millennial hanno maggiori probabilità di essere poveri e meno probabilità di sposarsi. Le famiglie odierne, guidate da persone di età compresa tra i 25 ei 32 anni, hanno accumulato solo la metà delle risorse finanziarie di quante ne avevano le loro controparti nel 1984, anche se oggi molti di loro hanno una laurea e generalmente sono più istruiti.
Certamente il crollo finanziario del 2007, e tutta la crisi economica che ne è derivata non ha aiutato le persone, e soprattutto i giovani, ad inserirsi nel mondo del lavoro.
Questa disparità indica sempre più un maggior contrasto generazionale. Mentre i baby boomer hanno beneficiato nella loro giovinezza dell’aumento della spesa pubblica, i millennial hanno subito un forte taglio sugli investimenti nel loro futuro.
In uno studio sulla rivista Atlantic risulta che il contrasto con i baby boomer è rivelatore se si osservano le spese.
Un esempio è il costo delle lezioni per le università pubbliche che dal 1964 al 1976 sono aumentate di circa $ 450, quando molti giovani, provenienti dalle ondate di boomers, hanno invaso i college americani. Al contrario, le lezioni universitarie dal 2001 al 2012 sono aumentate di oltre $ 3.200 mentre i millennial si riversavano nei campus.
Per questo il vero banco di prova, della crescente importanza delle generazioni nate dopo gli anni ‘80, sarà undrastico cambiamento del sistema politicoe forse, dei suoi rappresentati.

La Campagna Amnesty International sul Consenso,"Amnesty International ha lanciato recentemente una nuova campagna: #iolochiedo. Attraverso questa campagna, la ONG chiede al Ministro della Giustizia diaggiornare l’articolo 609-bis del codice penaleper inserire il concetto di consenso e adottare quindi nel proprio ordinamento interno gli standard internazionali.
Infatti,l’Italiaha ratificato, con la legge 27 giugno 2013 n. 77, laConvenzione del Consiglio d’Europa sulla prevenzione e la lotta contro la violenza nei confronti delle donne e la violenza domestica, anche nota come Convenzione di Istanbul. All’articolo 3 la Convenzione fornisce una definizione di diversi termini ed espressioni, tra cui “violenza contro le donne”, intesa come “violazione dei diritti umani e una forma di discriminazione contro le donne” che può avere luogo come danno o sofferenza “dinatura fisica, sessuale, psicologica o economica”. Sempre nella Convenzione, all’articolo 36, para.1, la violenza sessuale, stupro compreso, è definita come atto sessuale o altri atti di natura sessuale compiuti senza il consenso della vittima; al para.2, la normativa sancisce che:
“Il consenso deve essere datovolontariamente, qualelibera manifestazione della volontà della persona, e deve essere valutatotenendo conto della situazione e del contesto.”
IlGlobal Database sulla violenza contro le donne diUN Womeninserisce l’Italia al16° posto nel Gender Inequality Index(indice tridimensionale che tiene conto della salute riproduttiva, empowerment femminile e mercato del lavoro; posizione che indica la prossimità verso i vertici e quindi il tendere dell’Italia verso lo zero nella disparità di genere); l’European Institute for Gender Equality nota un miglioramento dell’Italia nel raggiungimento dell’uguaglianza di genere, segnando nel Gender Equality Index un punteggio pari 63.0 su 100, discostandosi di solo 4.4 dalla media europea.
Eppure, come Amnesty International ha sottolineato nella sua campagna,l’Italia fallisce nell’aggiornare il suo codice penale: l’articolo 609-bis si limita a definire l’illecito come atto imposto “con violenza o minaccia o mediante abuso di autorità, costringe taluno a compiere o subire atti sessuali”, mentre la Convenzione di Istanbul all’articolo 4, para.2, sancisce che le Parti debbano adottare senza indugio misure legislative che possano prevenire la discriminazione nei confronti delle donne.
Perché è importante il concetto di consenso?
Secondo l’ISTAT, il 21% delle 16-70enni (4 milioni 520 mila) ha subito violenza sessuale; il 5,4% (1 milione 157 mila) forme più gravi della violenza sessuale come lo stupro (652 mila) e il tentato stupro (746 mila). E soprattutto, considerando che “gli stupri sono stati commessi nel 62,7% dei casi da partner”, diventa rilevante il concetto di consenso.
Sempre in accordo alreport ISTAT pubblicato il 25 novembre 2019, giorno in cui ricorre la Giornata internazionale per l’eliminazione della violenza contro le donne,  in riferimento al periodo 2018, il 39,3% della popolazione ritiene che la donna possa sottrarsi, se vuole, a un rapporto sessuale.
“Anche la percentuale dichi pensa che le donne possanoprovocarela violenza sessualecon il loro modo di vestire è elevata (23,9%). Il 15,1%, inoltre, è dell’opinione che una donna che subisce violenza sessuale quando è ubriaca o sotto l’effetto di droghesiaalmeno in parteresponsabile.”
Come Amnesty International afferma nel sito della loro campagna, l’introduzione del consenso nel codice penale non significa che l’imputato dovrà dimostrare la propria innocenza poiché vige il principio “in dubio pro reo” (il dubbio va a vantaggio dell’accusato).
In conclusione, il requisito di consenso si potrebbe applicare ai casi di“stupro coniugale“, non ancora riconosciuto dall’ordinamento giuridico italiano, o casi in cui la vittima subisca l’effettofreezing, ossia quella reazione di immobilizzazione di fronte a situazioni di forte shock o trauma.
Senz’altro l’importanza risiede nel fatto che
“L’espressione del consenso non è la firma di un contratto,è la comunicazione di una volontà, è assicurarsi che in tutti i momenti del rapporto esista la reciproca voglia di stare insieme.”

ROAD TO NOVEMBER: Kanye West Presidente? It’s an old story,"Nel 2013 il sociologo Driessens disse che il fenomeno dellapersonalizzazione, cioè quello di mettere la personalità del singolo in primo piano, è sempre più in ascesa, soprattutto grazie allo sviluppo e al propagarsi dell’ideologia neoliberale.
Questo concetto ha intaccato negli ultimi anni sempre più il campo della politica, cambiando la visione che le generazioni precedenti avevano.L’ideologia e i partiti non risultano più essere il nucleo delle nostre democrazie, ma il singolo candidato, la comunicazione e l’uso massivo dei social media.
L’ultimo esempio di questo fenomeno è stata l’elezione, per molti a sorpresa mentre per alcuni analisti prevedibile, diTrump come Presidente degli Stati Uniti d’America, primo candidato vincente senza nessuna esperienza o incarico politico o istituzionale.
Questa elezione, oltre ad aver provocatomoltissime ripercussioni in svariati ambiti della politica(come quello economico, sociale, ambientale, diplomatico, etc.) ha semplicemente dimostrato come un soggetto del tutto fuori dalla politica ordinaria, possa comunque aspirare alla massima carica.La questione della “migrazione tra diversi campi sociali”, così descritta da Driessens e altri autori, ha avuto il suo massimo risultato.
È vero che gli Stati Uniti hanno ampiamente dimostrato che sono una nazione che accoglie in modo molto positivo questi “cambi di carriera”, come con gli ex attori Ronald Reagan e Arnold Schwarzenegger.Ma questo passaggio dallo showbusiness alla politica è risultato essere ancora più rapido di quanto molti esperti potevano immaginare.Un esempio sono le scommesse già iniziate per le prossime elezioni negli Stati Uniti: i bookmaker che quotavano una vittoria di Trump 150 a 1 nelle elezioni del 2016, già nel 2018 valutavano 100 a 1 una possibile elezione di Kanye West alle presidenziali del 2020.Due personaggi che arrivano dal mondo dell’entertainment, figure opposte eppure simili che potrebbero(non) finirecon lo sfidarsi per la carica di presidente USA 2020.
Kanye West è riconosciuto come uno dei più brillanti produttori discografici, oltre ad essere cantante, musicista, imprenditore e stilista.Nato nel 1977 ad Atlanta, all’età di tre anni si trasferì a Chicago con sua madre quando i suoi genitori divorziarono.West è cresciuto in un contesto molto agiato e culturalmente elevato.Suo padre, ex membro delle Black Panther fu il primo fotografo nero al The Atlanta Journal-Constitution e sua madre, fu una professoressa di inglese alla Clark Atlanta University, e presidente del Dipartimento di Inglese alla Chicago State University prima di diventare la manager del figlio.Frequentò corsi d’arte presso l’American Academy of Art di Chicago, ed era anche iscritto alla Chicago State University, ma decise di non proseguire gli studi per potersi concentrare sulla sua carriera musicale.
Ma durante gli MTV Video Music Awards 2015 di Los Angeles, Kanye West ha annunciato una “migrazione” dal suo campo in cui si è affermato, cioè che avrebbe corso per le presidenziali del 2020.
“New ideas. People with ideas, people who believe in truth. And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment,I have decided in 2020 to run for president.“
Molti media avevano liquidato questo intervento, sostenendo che un discorso di un personaggio abituato a non avere filtri comunicativi e con poca serietà sulle questioni più serie e importanti, aveva utilizzato quello spazio per ottenere maggiore attenzione.Ma durante un’intervista radiofonica alla BBC, nell’agosto del 2016, è tornato a parlare di politica, concentrandosi soprattutto sullequestioni razziali.
Kanye West ha spiegato di non avere posizioni politiche, aggiungendo che ha una sua idea “sull’umanità, sulle persone, sulla verità”.Oltretutto ha preso posizione sulla questione della violenza delle forze dell’ordine su le persone di colore, parlando di insensibilità delle istituzioni e dei mass media.
La recente vittoria di Donald Trump ha semplicemente dimostrato comeun soggetto del tutto fuori dalla politica ordinaria, possa comunque aspirare alla massima carica.
Molti elettori il giorno stesso dei risultati delle elezioni si sono chiesti: se il protagonista di uno show televisivo è riuscito a diventare presidente, perché non può provarci con un rapper?L’hashtag#kanye2020e#yeezy2020(Yeezy è il soprannome del cantante) sono diventati immediatamente trending su Twitter e sul sito Etsy erano già in vendita magliette, adesivi, spille dedicate all’impresa.
E non sono mancati neppure gli endorsement online. Dai colleghi Flying Lotus a Questlove dei The Roots alle migliaia di fan.Anche l’exPresidente Obamanon è rimasto impassibile davanti a questa situazione. E durante una cena di raccolta fondi prima delle elezioni del 2016 ha detto riferendosi a West:
«Credete davvero che questa nazione potrebbe eleggere presidente degli Stati Uniti un nero che viene dal sud di Chicago e che ha un nome bizzarro?»
Per provare anche solo a concepire le possibilità reali di un cantante rapper nero di diventare presidente bisogna partire dai numeri nei seggi, identificando e cercando di capire chi potrebbero essere i suoi principali supporter e finanziatori e soprattutto chi davvero potrebbe votarlo(oggi i dati gli danno possibilità pari allo zero).
Le elezioni americane del 2020 segneranno iltrionfo dei millennials, cioè delle generazioni libere da ideologie e precise posizioni politiche, che si informano soprattutto sul web e che hanno la potenzialità di essere deiEveryday Makersper qualsiasi candidato.
La suggestione è che non solo una nuova generazione di elettori, ma una lobby di imprenditori provenienti dai millenials sia interessata a finanziare qualcuno più in sintonia col loro universo.Pensiamo aMark Zuckerberg, il fondatore di Facebook, che ha preso precise posizioni durante la campagna elettorale del 2016 a favore dei democratici, oppure il 26enneEven Spiegel, co-fondatore dell’app Snapchat.L’elezione di Trump e la messa in discussione dei classici meccanismi politici che hanno regolato le candidature passate dei due maggiori partiti negli Stati Uniti ha creato delle aspettative sempre più orientate al mondo dello spettacolo che al mondo della politica.
Il personaggio di Kanye West è in realtà diviso in due figure: quella dellacelebrità politicae quella, oggi ancora forse una boutade, del politico celebrità.La differenza tra queste due tipologie di celebrità è principalmente la scelta di candidarsi o partecipare in prima persona all’attività politica in un paese.West è sicuramente una celebrità politica.Ha finanziato la campagna elettorale di Hillary Clinton, ma ha fatto pure un endorsement per Trump prima delle elezioni.
A livello di impegno politico, a parte una confusione di idee durante le sue interviste, l’unico elemento chiaro è il sostegno a favore deidiritti dei neri negli Stati Uniti.Ha più volte condiviso il noto hashtag#blacklivesmatter, (le vite dei neri contano). Movimento nato dall’indignazione e della rabbia per gli omicidi di alcuni afroamericani da parte di poliziotti bianchi nel 2016.
Famoso fu un suo intervento in diretta durante un telethon americano a reti unificate per raccogliere fondi dopo l’uragano Katrina. Kanye West pronunciò la famosa frase“George Bush Doesn’t Care About Black People“e anni dopo lo stesso presidente dirà che fuuno dei punti più bassi della sua presidenzamettendosi a confronto con Johnson e lo scontro sulla guerra in Vietnam con il giornalista Cronkite che portò a dire la famosa frase: «Se ho perso Walter Cronkite, ho perso l’America moderata.»
Se il nuovo scenario politico post-Trump è un panorama dove l’esperienza politica ha poco peso e l’elemento fondamentale non è quello di saper elaborare un piano d’azione politico quanto riuscire a coinvolgere la pancia dell’elettorato fino a controllarne le emozioni, è un terreno spianato per una qualsiasi popstar.
Kanye West, pur con tutte le sue molte contraddizioni, è sempre riuscito a costruire un immaginario coerente e un’identità mediatica che il pubblico ha saputo riconoscere e accettare.Saper proporre un’immagine di sé completamente trasparente verso i fan/elettori, essere senza filtri, e sembrare in continuo conflitto con il sistema sono state alcune delle ragioni della vittoria di Trump, e sono anche alcune delle caratteristiche del cantante rapper.Come la capacità di ascoltare la rete e appropriarsi del suo linguaggio.
Se invece, come dicono i sondaggi, gli americani vogliono appoggiarsi ad una figura che li traghetti fuori da una delle più gravi crisi economiche e li faccia “sopravvivere” ad una pandemia,la figura di West è in ritardo ormai di quattro anni.
Tre domande e qualche articolo per capire meglio di cosa parliamo:

Hagia Sophia and the Role of Religion in Turkey’s Politics,"Hagia Sophia, also called Church of the Holy Wisdom or Church of the Divine Wisdom, is one of the world’s most famous Byzantine monument, built in Costantinople (today Istanbul, Turkey) in the 6th century by Emperor Justinian I.
Consecrated in the year 360 by Costantius II, its history is made of destroying and reconstructions. In 1453 it has been repurposed as a mosque and only in 1934 it has been secularized by PresidentKemal Atatürk, becoming a museum. Now, Hagia Sophia is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Historic Area of Istanbul. Lately, the monument appeared on the news all over the world following the decision of the current Turkish PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğanto turn the site, once again, into a mosque. The announcement found a strong negative response, especially in the West.
To understand these reactions, it is necessary to analyze the role of religion in Turkey, and how much it affected and still affects its politics, through the everlasting opposition between secularism and Islamism.
TheRepublic of Turkeywas born in the aftermath of the World War I, based on the ideology also known asAtatürkismorKemalism, from the name of its leader and then first Turkey’s President,Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. This founding ideology had as its main goal the separation from the Ottoman predecessors and their religion-based monarchy, with the modernization of the Turkish society through a series of cultural, religious, political and social reforms. Amongst those reforms, one of the most important has been theabolition of many of the traditional institutions of the former Islamic State(e.g. the Caliphate in 1924) and the establishment of a modern version of Islam submitted to the Turkish nation, which maintains the sovereignty above religion.  President Atatürk started thelaicizationof Turkey.
The death of Kemal Atatürk and the World War II both came without affecting this new equilibrium, with Turkey joining theUNin 1945 with its new President İsmetİnönü. After an initial economic boom with the government of AdnanMenderes, who had also been more indulgent with the Islamic, in the 1950s the country entered an economic crisis that brought some antidemocratic pushes to silent the opposition.
The following years will be characterized by the opposition between the Kemalist party (CHP, Popular Republican Party) and theDemocratic Party, which eventually won the elections. Then, two coup d’état in the 1960s and 1970s, and a strong political instability led to the raise in the 1970s and in the 1980s of theNational Salvation Party(MSP) and theNationalist Movement Party(MHP). The main intent of the MSP was the Islamization of Turkey and the reinstatement of the Islamic law. The Islamic party opposed to the liberal economy and, while reinforcing the bond with the other Islamic states, worked to undermine the relationships with the Western Bloc.
The2002 elections saw the winner in Erdoğan, leader of the Justice and Development party (AKP), first as Prime Minister and then, from 2014, as the country’s President. Several riots have shaken the country since then, and the repressive methods used by Erdogan’s in reply to those demonstrations have caused the deterioration of the relationship between Turkey and the EU.
Over the years, Erdogan started theneo-ottomanization of Turkeyand to restrict the country’s democracy. One of the most famous act have been the passing of the Internet laws, with which the government tightened its control over the Internet, expanding the national telecom authority, after having already given to the same authority the power to block access to certain web pages without a prior court order, undermining the freedom of speech.
But as we stated at the beginning of this article,there is no politics in Turkey without religion. And the very differentiation between secularism and Islamism fills the political history of this country. Secularism, or laicism, was first introduced in 1928 with the amendment to the Constitution of 1924 which declared that the Islam was the State religion, this way separating religion from the State. Over the years, Erdogan has not been the only one to try to swift the country religious balance in favor of the Islamism, and the very monument Hagia Sophia has been at the center of several propositions to become the symbol of Islamism in Turkey.
But what seem to be important is not the country’s religion per se, ratherhow Erdogan could be using Islam to dismantle democracy and to bring the country into a new authoritarianism, reducing, amongst others, religious pluralism, which was alsoone of the conditions set by the European Union to grant access to Turkey amongst its now 27 Member States. Or at least this is the western perception: those who defend Erdogan’s politics claim his government has actually brought to a new pluralism, allowing the creation of several religious movements and associations and improving the dialogue with the Cristian representations over the country, at least until the coup d’état of 2016. This vision is based on anhistorical interpretation of Turkey’s secularismthrough the years of the Republic of Turkey, according to which it was actually a repressive and closed system only necessary to find a unifying vision for the newly born Republic.
Yet, thefailed coup d’état of 2016changed the situation for the worse, inaugurating an era of repression,political instabilityand the need for Erdogan to reinforce his powers over the country. This situation gave him the pretext to legitimize his pushes to the constitutional reform which would have transformed Turkey from a Parliamentary Republic into a Presidential one, expanding Erdogan’s powers. In 2017, after a referendum often defined as shady by the opposition, the amendments proposed by the AKP were ratified and the most important transformation of the Country began.
The conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque has always been one of Erdogan’s dreams,as stated by himself. But in the context of Erdogan’s reforms, the neo-ottomanization of the country, we can see how symbolic this decision is in the path of dismantling Atatürk’s legacy. For some, the announcement served as adistraction from the damages that theCOVID-19has brought to the Country; for others, like UNESCO, the monument belongs to the world heritage and not to Turkey. On his side, Erdogan’s defended his choice by stating that Turkey only applied its sovereignty over the monument, hence exercising its right.
Nevertheless, it could be read as part of a bigger political plan. With this move, Erdoğan is trying togather consensus from the conservative forces in a delicate situationsuch as an economic crisis exasperated by the pandemic. To position himself and the country as a point of reference for the Islamic, also means to gather hegemony in theMiddle East. Finally, with this act, he is stepping away from theEU, refusing to be influenced by the West as it has been the case at the beginning of the Republic of Turkey.

Femicides in Turkey: “I don’t want to die!”,"On Tuesday, July 21st, Pinar Gultekin, a 27-year-old Turkish University student, was found dead in the woods after she had gone missing for about a week.The autopsy revealed the horrendous details of her murder: she was battered, strangled and burned. Lastly, concrete was poured all over her charred body presumably in an attempt to discard off any evidence.
However, amidst investigations, Pinar’s ex-partner, Cemal Avci, confessed to the murder claiming she provoked him by threatening to reveal their relationship to his wife. This murder thus adds Pinar to the long list ofTurkish women who have died at the hands of their partners: former, present, and aspiring.
Protests have thus broken out all overTurkey, with women taking the streets to demand action and justice from their government. Protestors have carried purple banners with the names and faces of some of the victims of femicides so far, as they expressed outrage about the increasing levels of violence imposed on women. Unfortunately, femicides in Turkey only soared in 2020 amidst theCovid-19 crisis.
TheWe Will End Femicide Platform,an organization dedicated to tracking, and curbing femicides in Turkey following the government’s inefficiency, reports that 21 femicides had already been committed within the first 20 days of quarantine i.e. between March 11 and March 31.According to thereport, 4 of the women are confirmed to have been killed by their partners for seeking autonomy over their own lives, such as financial independence, for wanting to leave abusive partners, or simply creating social media accounts.
Holistically, femicides in Turkey all seem to stem from the prevalent sexist notion of men being the custodians of women’s bodies, properties and lives in general.These same misogynistic ideals are a major barrier to any progress being made in the fight against femicides in Turkey as a substantial percentage of Turkish men have openly expressed their fears of feminist movements working to erodetraditional Turkish family values and traditions. Moreover, some of these same traditions such as honor killings undoubtedly disable the efforts being made to lobby for women’s’ rights. In response to this, and to the perpetuating femicides, the leaders of various women rights platforms have made it clear that they will not stop marching until their pleas are heard, calling for an end to sexism in both discourse and practice.
The hashtag #pinargultekinis also trending on social media as users flood the platforms to express their outrage, spread awareness and call for allyship especially from their government. Governmental support is especially crucial because femicides in Turkey continue to occur despite the ratification of relevant treaties. The Istanbul Convention of 2011, an European agreement aimed at mitigating gender based violence, was ironically primarily ratified by Turkey. The country also adopted the 6284 Turkish law in 2012 to protect family, and prevent violence against women.As unfortunate as it is ironic however, femicides have doubled since these laws were adopted, exposing the governmental negligence.
Unfortunately, this pattern is not novel to Turkey, as almost exactly a year ago, in August 2019, the hashtag #idontwanttodiewas trending. These were the last words ofEmine Bulutto her 10-year-old daughter who begged her not to die as she was being gruesomely stabbed by her ex-partner. The horrendous video of the woman screaming those infamous words before her death went viral, and enraged Turkish women who resorted to social media to protest and call for a change.However, one year and 424 more femicides later, not much has changed.
Nonetheless, Turkish women remain determined to fight for their rights. As the passionate university student Nisa Bosnak from Trabzon city writes to TNGO:
“This is an inhuman event…We are fighting for the acceptance of the Istanbul Convention in our country. What we all want as all women isto live fearlessly and freely. This was not the first and may not be the last, we will prove the power of being a woman by bringing our struggle to victory.”
Therefore, as the protests continue, and as the world gains more awareness  of the situation, joining in solidarity, Turkish women remain tireless in crying out to their men, their government, and to the world:“I don’t want to die!”

La Partecipazione Politica Giovanile in Italia tra Sfide e Risorse,"Questo articolo è stato realizzato in collaborazione conYezers, la Startup di Due Generazioni.
Analizzare in modo olistico il fenomeno della partecipazione politica giovanile in Italia non può non tener conto dello scenario internazionale dell’Unione Europea(UE), poiché, nell’era dellagovernancetransnazionale, ciò risulterebbe anacronistico. Visualizzare lo spaccato italianoall’internodella cornice Europaè importante poiché ci consente di confrontare il nostro paese con gli altri dell’Unione, così da osservare l’approccio dell’UE al coinvolgimento politico delle nuove generazioni.
A partire dal 2002, la Commissione Europea ha inaugurato la cosiddettaYouth Policy Strategy(attuata con la Risoluzione del Consiglio Europeo del 26 Novembre 2018), un ambizioso piano di riferimento per le politiche Europee rivolte ai giovani. L’iniziativa si ripromette di promuovere “(…) la partecipazione dei giovani nella vita democratica (….)” con il fine ultimo di sostenerne e garantirnel’impegno sociale e civico. Tale proposta mira ad un’ampia azione trasversale a 360°, la cui base poggia su tre pilastri cardine:“Mobilitare, collegare e responsabilizzare”. Diverse sono le modalità di implementazione, tra le quali “attività di apprendimento reciproco, ildialogo dell’UE con i giovani”, etc.
La comunicazione fra istituzioni Europee e giovani è cruciale: lo testimoniano gli11 obiettivi,vale a direi cosiddetti 11Youth Goals, indicatori di “problematiche trasversali aventi un’incidenza sulla vita dei ragazzi”.Parità di genere, inclusione sociale, richiesta di spazi di partecipazione unita ad un maggiore dialogo tra UE e giovani: varie le richieste degli11 obiettivi. Proposti all’interno della sesta edizione della piattaforma di Dialogo dal titolo “Youth in Europe: What’s next?’, gli Youth Goals testimoniano il desiderio dell’UE (come prova laRisoluzione del Consiglio Europeo sulla strategia per la gioventù 2019-2027) di dare voce ai giovani affinché possano ricoprire un ruolo centrale nell’UE.
Alcuni dati rilasciati da unDocumento di Lavoro (Maggio 2018) della Commissione Europeaenfatizzano informazioni interessanti sullapartecipazione politica giovanile in Italia e nell’UE, di cui qui di seguito si evidenzieranno alcune variabili importanti. Come primo indicatore, si prenda in considerazioneil crescente interesse in politica da parte dei giovani.
I dati dimostrano che, a partire dal 2010, l’interesse dei giovani (15-24 anni) è aumentato considerevolmente: la media UE ha registrato un aumento dal 40% del 2010 al 50% del 2017, probabilmente a causa dell’uso crescente di Social Media e dispositivi elettronici. Come seconda variabile rilevante, si consideri lapercezione, tra i più giovani, della cittadinanza Europea: nel decennio 2010-2017, la fetta più giovane della popolazione (15-24 anni e 25-39) registra quasi l’80% e il 75% (contro il 70% e 60%più anziano).
Tuttavia, nonostante il crescente interesse politico, la percentuale di giovani elettori risulta in continuo calo a livello Europeo (74% nel 2017). L’Italia, insieme a Malta, Austria e Polonia, registra una fra le più alte partecipazioni (80%), mentre la situazione è drammatica in Irlanda, Lussemburgo e Cipro (oscillante fra il 45% e 40%). Inoltre, per quanto riguarda larappresentanza giovanile in istituzioni Europee, la situazione è negativa: basti pensare che la percentuale di Membri del Parlamento al di sotto dei 30 anni o più giovani è scesa dal 3.4% nel 2009 al 1.9% nel 2014.
In una democrazia rappresentativa, è anche fondamentale misurare  altri indicatori, comel’appartenenza e adesione dei giovani a partiti politici.Soltanto il 7% della gioventù Europea risulta membro di un partito o associazione politica (nonostante questa percentuale sia aumentata fra il 2010-2017). Nel 2018, la percentuale media Europea era dell’8% per gli uomini contro il 6% delle donne. Qui, l’Italia registra un calo decisivo (dal 7% nel 2011 al 5% nel 2017), la Germania una discesa ancor più allarmante (12% nel 2011 al 5% nel 2017), la Francia lo stesso (dal 4% al 2%), infine la Spagna dal 5% al 2,5%.
Per fortuna, la partecipazione politica dei giovani non si manifesta solo attraverso l’appartenenza a partiti politici: c’è un ultimo interessante indicatore,la percentuale di giovani attiva in associazioni politiche informali e alternative  ai partiti ufficiali volte al miglioramento della realtà locale.La percentuale a livello europeo sale al 15% per gli uomini, e all’11% per le donne. Qui, l’Italia svetta ed è seconda solo all’Irlanda: mentre quest’ultima raggiunge quasi il 23% nel 2017 (vs 25% nel 2011), l’Italia registra un fiduciosoraddoppio,dal 10% nel 2011 al ben 20% nel 2017. Positive sono anche lepercentualiin aumento di altri paesi dell’Europa occidentale, Francia e Spagna, mentre al contrario peggiora la situazione di Cipro e Malta (dal 10% al 5%) e diversi paesi dell’Est Europa.
Delle diverse argomentazioni utili per decifrare la partecipazione politica dei giovani, una delle più interessanti (e logiche)  è ladiretta correlazione tramaturità della democraziae partecipazione politica giovanile– come afferma Magdelina Kitanova, ricercatrice dell’Università di Southampton, in una suaricerca. In democrazie neonate e poco mature, come ad esempio gli stati un tempo parte dell’URSS e dell’Est Europa, la partecipazione politica sarà meno stabile rispetto alle democrazie avanzate, a causa di un minor grado di maturità e stabilità democratica.
In breve quindi i“giovani (non) politici italiani”sono in netto vantaggio dal punto di vista della partecipazione politica in confronto al resto della gioventù europea, soprattutto per ciò che riguarda la percentuale di giovani attiva in associazioni politiche informali e alternative ai partiti ufficiali volte al miglioramento della realtà locale, mentre come nel resto dell’Europa l’adesione dei giovani ai partiti politici è in continuo calo.
Ma cosa sappiamo nel dettaglio della partecipazione politica giovanile nel nostro Paese? Come si comportano i giovani rispetto alla cosa pubblica e quali sono i temi in cui si impegnano maggiormente facendo sentire la propria voce?
Partiamo anche qui da alcuni dati.In Italia,i giovani che non partecipano alla vita politica sono in aumento.Il report 2020 dell’Istatsegnala infatti che la mancanza di partecipazione generale nei confronti dei temi politici riguarda circa il 30% dei giovani tra i 18 e i 34 anni, dieci punti percentuali in più rispetto al 2014. Se poi si guarda alla fascia compresa fra i 14 e i 18 anni, il dato attuale sfiora invece il 50% contro il 40% del 2014.
Tuttavia, rispetto alla media del Paese, nel 2019 gli individui fra i 14 e i 24 anni risultano i più coinvolti all’interno di esperienze di politica attiva. Il 14% di loro, in particolare, ha partecipato in maniera diretta ad iniziative politiche (soprattutto attraverso cortei e manifestazioni) rispetto all’8% della popolazione adulta, mentre raggiunge il 70% il numero di coloro che fra i 14 e i 34 anni si sono informati di politica tramite internet almeno una volta a settimana. Un dato rilevante se si tiene conto che la tendenza ad informarsi decresce con l’avanzare dell’età e che la media italiana di coloro che si informano su internet con la stessa periodicità è del 74,8%.
Secondo l’Istat ildisinteresseè la principale causa della mancata partecipazione e dell’assenza di informazione. A questo si aggiungono lasfiducia nel sistema politico e l’idea che i temi trattati siano troppo complicati. Il picco dei disinteressati (70%) è rappresentato dai giovani fino ai 24 anni, sebbene la percentuale non scenda mai sotto il 60% nel caso degli individui più grandi. Coloro che infine sono classificati come totalmente distaccati dalla vita politica, poiché affermano di non parlarne, di non informarsi e di non svolgere affatto attività correlate, sono più di 12 milioni di persone. Di questi, il 46,6% sono minori.
In secondo luogo, diviene necessario porsi una domanda, soprattutto osservando i dati riportati i quali indicano che gli individui fra i 14 e i 24 anni risultano i più coinvolti nell’attivismo politico e che al contrario è sempre più in calo la loro adesione a partiti politici.E se la mancanza di partecipazione giovanile nella politica nazionale fosse ascrivibile all’incapacità di riformarsi dell’attuale sistema politico, e quindi anche della maggioranza dei partiti?
I temi per i quali si battono le generazioni Y e Z mancano di un quasi totale spessore in Parlamento, e per questoi giovani preferiscono scendere in piazza anziché conformarsi a un modo di fare politica che appartiene ormai solo alle istituzioni. Il successo diFridays for Future, ilgreenmovementche si dichiara apartitico, si deve all’enorme mobilitazione di studenti, i quali hanno testato l’impatto di uno sciopero e lo hanno messo a servizio di un tema che, nonostante sia forse il più urgente, raramente figura nelle priorità parlamentari, in particolare in quelle italiane. E la capofila di tutti questi studenti, Greta Thunberg, è così giovane da non essere nemmeno maggiorenne, e ciononostante è riuscita a parlare allaConferenza delle Nazioni Unite sui cambiamenti climatici del 2018.
Oltre che a sostegno del movimento ambientalista i giovani oggi scendono in piazza per sventolare altre bandiere, come quella arcobaleno che rappresenta idiritti LGBTQ+, che hanno raggiunto invece le poltrone parlamentari grazie ad undisegno di leggeche si riallaccia alla legge Mancino contro il razzismo e che propone di punire fino a 4 anni di carcere chi istiga alla violenza omotransfobica. Infine, nell’ultimo mese i social e le piazze del pianeta sono state teatro delle manifestazioni e proteste per i diritti degli afroamericani negli Stati Uniti, e nel mondo, a seguito dellamorte di George Floyd dovuta alla violenza della polizia americana, la quale è tristemente responsabile di più di un tale crimine. Ed in Italia le nuove generazioni non sono rimaste in disparte, basti vederepiazza Duca d’Aosta a Milano lo scorso 7 Giugno.
Molti giovani rimangono però con una mancanza di interesse nel far combaciare alcuni dei temi per i quali si battono con concrete proposte elettorali, e soprattutto conuna singola proposta elettorale. Infatti è in momenti epocali come questo che diviene chiaro che Black Lives Matter, Fridays for Future e i Pride, non sono solo i temi che le generazioni Y e Z ritengono di maggiore rilevanza, sono anche complementari l’uno con l’altro e smascherano il malfunzionamento del sistema politico-economico globale.
Fra le esperienze, la partecipazione politica degli under 35 passa anche daYezers –La Startup di Due Generazioniideata con l’intento di affrontare le sfide del presente dando spazio al protagonismo dei giovani. Nata a Milano nel 2017, apartitica e composta interamente da ragazzi e ragazze appartenenti alle generazioni Y e Z, la startup si propone di unire le energie e le competenze di giovani studenti e professionisti desiderosi di offrire il proprio contributo a sostegno di una trasformazione sociale, economica e politica del Paese. Il progetto porta con sé proposte concrete, iniziative ed eventi di confronto all’insegna della cittadinanza attiva.Dal contrasto al cambiamento climatico fino alla valorizzazione del talento giovanile, l’obiettivo è favorire lo sviluppo di una società più equa e sostenibile dove i giovani possano avere sempre più voce in capitolo.
Infine, è necessario considerare che un’eventuale mancanza di rappresentazione parlamentare dei temi per i quali i giovani si battono può e deve divenire motivo di interesse nel penetrare e reinventare il sistema politico attuale. Per far ciò un’educazione sempre più elevata accompagnata ad un placement lavorativo diviene necessaria. Osservando i dati si comprende che l’Italia può ancora spingersi avanti per quanto riguarda occupazione lavorativa, l’educazione e i training dei giovani, così da fornire strumenti che possano istituzionalizzare i temi per i quali le piazze vengono riempite. In Italia infatti la percentuale di giovani fra i 15 e i 24 anni che né lavoravano né studiavano o facevano training nel 2017 eral’11,9 %, in confronto al 5,5% della Francia e il 4,1% della Germania, mentre nel 2019 il dato è salito al13,5% in Italia, l’8,2% in Francia e il 10,3% in Germania.Un investimento nella preparazione dei giovani che mostrano interesse in quei temi che la politica nazionale spesso non riesce ancora a far propri è ciòdi cuile generazioni Y e Z necessitano, così da poter competere con l’attuale classe dirigente e rendere la loro partecipazione non solo attiva ma anche gestionale, in un clima politico che diverrebbe avanguardista.

Beirut: Between Explosions & Geopolitical Tensions,"A devastatingmushroom-shaped explosionhit the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on the late afternoon of the 3rd of August, leaving most of the city severely damaged and the port almost completely vanished. Initial claims talked about an explosion in a fireworks warehouse, but further investigation confirmed that there were 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate confiscated in the city’s port, without the necessary safety measures, to cause the explosions and the shock wave blast. Traditionally used as a fertilizer but also as a component of explosives, those tonnes of ammonium nitrate could only cause an explosion of that calibre if in touch with a flammable component.
The intense blast – which would be equivalent to a3,3 earthquake for its shock wave– has devastated a city that has beensuffering with a heavy economic crisis, just topped with the Coronavirus pandemic, which has left its hospitals over their capacity.More than 45% of Beirut’s population lives under the poverty line, and Tuesday’s explosion left the city’s grain silo unusable – Beirut would depend on foreign aid in order to be able to survive such a grave situation, which is spent with random electricity cuts and rationing of goods. Over 300.000 civilians are left homeless amid the explosion, and the wounded count over 5.000.
The death toll rises as victims are recovered from under the rubble, and Lebanon’s economy, which is officially considered a fail, relies on the broad-spread aid received from other countries, who are providing medical equipment and necessary goods to assist the wounded. The estimated material damage is around15 billion dollars– which leaves Beirut at the mercy of countries and entities willing to offer help.Israel, in spite of lacking diplomatic relations with Lebanon and having a bad past with its neighbour, has offered economic and humanitarian aid, which allegedly Lebanon has not yet accepted.
United States’ President Donald Trumphurried to assume, though with no claims, that the explosion that hit Beirut was the result of an attack – an affirmation that was denied by Lebanese officials and other organizations.Hassan Nasrallah, Lebanese politician and secretary of the Shiite party Hezbollah, pledged his party’s innocence and denied housing weapons and explosives in the port’s warehouse, together with initially refuting the suspicion of Israel’s involvement in the incident. Nonetheless, President Aoun asks to observe the possibility that the explosion may be due toa missile thrown from a raid or a bomb.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Hassan Diab created aninvestigation committeeto find and prosecute the explosions’ responsibles within 5 days – beginning withthe house arrest of port officials to dismantle anyone who was aware of the threat these chemicals posed. Badri Daher, the head of Lebanon’s Customs Authority, allegedly warned the judiciary repeatedly about harmful substances stored without safety measures in Beirut’s port.
The event happens on the same week ofRafik Hariri’s murder trial, with 4 Hezbollah members charged. The Lebanon Tribunal decided to postpone the verdict for the case to August 18, with the hope that Beirut’s most immediate needs are covered and calmed until that date.
Incensed social protests have risen among the rubble in Beirut against the government and its inability to deal with the country’s crisis, with even some citizen platforms asking for the removal of the current politicians and a come-back to a French Protectorate, seen that French PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas presented himself among Beirutis while the local government did not make act of presence nor aid in cleaning up the streets. Hassan Diab, Lebanon’s former Prime Minister, resigned on the 10th August, amid the people’s demands to end up corruption.
On a regional level, Lebanon would risk a similar fate to that ofSyriaandLibyaif unable to reassess its political and economic crisis amid the devastating situation, and due to its current vulnerability, foreign regional forces may try to use this fact to gain benefit and geopolitical influence.

Japan: UK-EU Trade Deals to Revolutionize Geopolitics,"Following the2016 nationwide referendumthat formally separated the future of the United Kingdom with that of its longtime friend – the European Union – countries worldwide have had to re-adapt to these changes. Brexit meant that if nations, such as Japan, formerly had direct relations with the EU as a whole, Japan would be soon required to reinvent its bilateral relations with the EU and the UK separately. Talks on trade deals have continued for years, but it seems that2020 could be the year to revolutionize these dynamics.
Since early January 2019, it was believed that the UK would accompany the EU in similar talks with Japan, but the time occupied by Brexit implied that the would UK arrive over a year later at that same table. In fact, whilst the EU-Japan trade deal was agreed in thefirst few months of 2019, the UK agenda predicts closing its “continuing” deals with Japan at theend of August 2020. New agreements with the UK have been extremely complicated and these agreements have become even more complicated amid the Coronavirus outbreak.
What does the EU-Japan deal consist of?
According to BBC News, this wastheworld’s biggest trade deal in 2019, covering a third of the global GDP and involving over 600 million people. The main concern was that of scrapping import duties. The EU is among Japan’s top importers of food and beverage services, therefore this deal could eventually lead to the “progressive reduction of nearly €1bn ($1.1bn; £0.9bn) of tariffs – nearly 40% on beef, up to 30% on chocolate, 15% on wine and up to 40% on cheese”, says BBC. Likewise, the EU would commit to reducing 10% on the import of Japanese cars to zero by 2027.
Not only this would allow the EU and Japan to engage in closer diplomatic and economic ties, but it would also createmore opportunities for their citizens, mainly in the services sector. In fact, with lower tariffs, it is likely that financial and business firms would remain in European or Japanese territory due to a more convenient environment to grow in. This means that employers of all kinds would be encouraged to stay in these territories at lower costs, without feeling the need to relocate to developing countries while providing services for the EU or Japan from abroad.
A video by EuroNews below, however, presents issues arising from this trade deal.
Why is a deal with the UK harder to secure?
Brexit has inevitably revolutionizedthe position of the UK in geopolitics, and the UK has had to start exploring opportunities for agreements globally. Finding itself in such a globalized environment that demands deals to bemade quicklyto avoid bringing side-effects to the global economy, it is obvious theUK has faced an unprecedented workload to address these new relationships with foreign countries.Whilst the global economy runs extremely fast, it is inevitable and obvious that the UK has been wanting to prioritize agreements that would bring win-win benefits for its growth as an individual power. These, including the deal with Japan, take time to perfect.
Japan is the UK’s fourth largest trading partner outside the EU, and, as the Evening Standard reports “trade with Japan was worth more than £30 billion last year.” Negotiations between the two countries have been going on since early 2020 and are still unresolved as of August 15th, 2020, becauseInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss wants to prove the UK can get better deals with Japan than the EU. On Tokyo’s negotiation team, Chief Negotiator Hiroshi Matsuura believed it was possible to complete negotiations by the end of July but the global pandemic that has so aggressively impacted both economies did not help secure agreements on time. London and Tokyo, however, both expect to close the deal by September, so that it is officially enforced by the end of the year.
How would the UK-Japan partnership overtake the previous EU-Japan deal?
Compared to the EU, the UK has been pushing for a better agreement in services and e-commerce. Truss says UK and Japan “have reached consensus on the major elements […] including ambitious provisions in areas like digital, data and financial services that go significantly beyond the EU-Japan deal.” The UK Parliament also believes this deal will take the UK one step closer from joining theComprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which not only includes Asian nations but stretches to Australia and Chile.Brexit may provide an opportunity for the UK to reaffirm the great power it once had around the globe.
TheUK-Japantrade deal is broadly based on the one Tokyo has made with the EU, however, the UK has worked on renegotiating further tariff reductions on the automobile, tech, and food imports/exports. Whilst, as previously mentioned, the EU is committing to remove the 10% duty on imported cars by the end of the decade, the UK is immediately negotiating for the application of zero tariffs by end of 2020.This competition between the UK and the EU inevitably puts Japan in the best position, as both will race to strike better and better deals.
Because of the lack of time available for in-depth discussions due to the end of the Brexit transition period on 31st December 2020,the UK is leaving out sectors that will need further attention in the future. For instance, agriculture-related subjects must be specified in future UK-Japan talks, according toThe Guardian. In fact, workers in the UK food and beverage sector particularly complain about the poor negotiations made to value British products such as the British blue cheese.
As shown in the video below from CNA, Japan and the UK are also dealing with the anxiety that the WTO standard regulations will start taking over by the beginning of 2021 if the bilateral deal is not secured earlier.

Financial Control & Gender Equality – A Conversation with Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen,"In June 2020, TNGO Political AnalystMatthew Lynesinterviewed Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, co-founder ofFemale Invest, discussing the role of gender (in)equality in the financial world.
A place in the Forbes 30 under 30 list for finance. Cartier Women’s Initiative winners 2020. The largest financial educator targeting women in Northern Europe. A best selling book. Not bad for a group of women under 30. Anna Hartvigsen and the team at Female Invest are committed to the fight for gender equality.
Like so many people growing up, Anna didn’t notice the inequality between genders. She believed that hard work would get her anywhere, however this all changed at the age of 19 when she started investing!
“That was the first time I realized that at least there wasn’t anyone looking like me in this world.”
After realizing this, Anna started looking into various pieces of research and quickly learnt thatthe lack of women in finance and investment was a global problem. She therefore took this as her issue to solve.
One day in the library along with her friend, Emma Blitz, the idea to form aninvestment group for young womenwas hatched, with this idea growing exponentially since then into an organisation with a mission of creating financial, and general, gender equality.
Female Invest now hosts events for over 25,000 women and is the largest financial educator in Northern Europe, with the business planning to go predominantly online following the success of their online programs throughout theCOVID-19 crisis. Therefore, some would find it hard to believe that Anna is still faced with prejudices 7 years on from the start of her investing journey. Some of these prejudices are as ludicrous as “not knowing anything about the area” or being sarcastically referred to as an “expert” by others in the sector.
Moreover, the prejudices often extend further than these comments, Anna explained:
“We are often faced with different prejudices, and I think we are measured differently, and then I think there will always be, at least for now, a sense of the old boys club when it comes to finance.”
No more than anything, this shows to me that theproblems of male dominance and strong traditionalism in the financial worldare still rife, and that there is a long way to go in thefight for gender equality.
Despite the difficulties of being a woman in the world of investing, Anna has found some positives from her situation, something that has helped her and her team to continue their drive.
“I think the benefits are that we are being noticed more because there aren’t many of us”.
This is, of course, a positive for the team, but even if the area was balanced, there’s no doubt that their passionate work would make them stand out in an extremely professional environment.
One of the most important things about their business is that despite the knockbacks and inequalities faced trying to break the norms of the “old boys club” – as Anna describes it, the team has a fierce ability to stick to their guns and not sacrifice who they are or what they’re fighting for in order to fit in. Their positive work will also hopefully inspire more women to get out there and fight to financially empower women and enable them to take a greater responsibility in their life.
Sohow can we fight to overcome this gender inequality?
According to Anna’s expertise, it is all aboutfemale empowerment, and it starts withwealth management.
“The way they (women) manage their money actually has alarger impacton their lifetime wealththan the gender pay-gap does. (…) One of the only things women can change today themselves is to take charge of their money”.
Clearly, Anna underlines how the power of managing your own finances should never be underestimated. It is a fantastic and manageable place to start which, according to the co-founder of Female Invest, can lead to greater female empowerment. This message is also clearly reflected in the future plans for her and the business.
“I hope Female Invest can play a role inmaking financial education easily accessible to women around the world. (…) If we succeed in doing that then I think that we can impact gender equality globally. (…) More women […] will be able to take more charge of their own lives”.
The messages of female empowerment are extremely strong and the world will certainly be a stronger place with Female Invest and their dedication to fighting for gender equality.","August 13, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/human-stories/financial-control-gender-equality-a-conversation-with-anna-sophie-hartvigsen/,Matthew Lynes,thenewglobalorder.com,Human Stories
Fake News and COVID-19: The Spreading of a “Disinfodemic”,"The fake-news issue is certainly not a new topic. As social media took over political propaganda and became a crucial campaign tool, the spread of tainted news to swing the pools has also become rampant. This, of course, was just a smoke screen; a seemingly harmless propaganda tool to attract the attention of those who could not see through the lies. This has been going on for some time now, with a general passive acceptance to it. We have grown accustomed to fake news, partially due to the sheer amount of media outlets that populate the internet, and partially for our own inability to act. However,asCovid-19broke loose across the world, the spread of misinformation and fake news turned out to be a far more dreadful affair.
In order to begin our analysis, it is crucial to understand the bearing that mainstream media has on our society. In our ever-more globalized world, it is in the media outlets that the power of shifting public opinion and beliefs regarding our present resides. However, this can easily become a double-edged sword, for the same power that resides in information is present in misinformation as well. The duty of a journalist is to report the present, and to spread awareness and knowledge: not to let private interests get in the way of describing reality.Indeed, while information empowers, disinformation disempowers: it endangers lives and leads to confusion and discord.
Hence, it would appear extremely necessary that during the worst pandemic that humankind has ever faced, news would have been as thorough and accurate as possible to help the population handle this tragedy. Sadly, it was not. Asa study from Amy Watson points out, “around 47 percent of surveyed U.S. adults had encountered a lot or at least some news about the coronavirus which seemed completely made up”.She continues:
“This highlightsthe issue of fake news circulationand unreputable sources seeking to capitalize on the public’s need for news and updates in times of crisis.”
This shows the egoistical nature of modern mainstream media. The purpose is no longer to spread news in order to create a well informed and functional society. Rather,it has become a sort of rat race: an egotistical competition to see who can get the most clicks and visualizations.A race in which the only losers are us, the people, who are left wandering in the dark without a reliable source of information.
As further evidence, a study conducted by the APS (Association for Psychological Science) on a basis of over 1700 adults presents evidencethat people share false claims about Covid-19 simply because they do not bother to check whether what they are sharing online is actually accurate or not.This was due partially to a lack of fact checking that can be classified as laziness. However,the majority of the examined confessed that the reason they did not bother to actually check whether the news they were sharing was accurate or not is because they had complete faith that the source they were taking from was accurate.Therefore, the issue of fake news is rooted at the core. People have grown accustomed to believing and trusting in certain media outlets who they believe to be reporting the truth. However, no matter the fact that many of these outlets are lying, people still blindly follow them, usually due to ties to certain political realities.
Data from the UNESCO report “Journalism, press freedom and COVID-19” reflect the exposure audiences have to disinformation and their consequent vulnerability to the latter. The Bruno Kessler foundation, analysing 112 million social media posts, showed that40% of the posts were based on unreliable sources. According to the Reuters Institute, “roughly ⅓ of social media users have reported seeing false or misleading information about the coronavirus”. Furthermore, there are 191 websites in Europe and North America that published fake news about Covid-19. Finally, “more than 3500 false or misleading pieces of information” were reported and disproved by the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance.All of these data tell us a story, a pattern of mischief that impoverishes the purposes of journalism and communication.
News can influence the behaviour of people; in such unprecedented times, it is crucial to spread clear and truthful information. As the World Health Organization has stated, together with the pandemic,an “infodemic” has emerged: the overwhelming amount of facts given to audiences makes it problematic to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources.When people’s lives are at stake, trustworthy and objective information should be prioritised, and political agendas should be put in second place. It became clear that it is fundamental to stop the spread of fake news on social media with appropriate regulations, however without imposing a limitation on freedom of speech.

Trump VS USPS: Who Will Survive?,"Trump has admitted he is undermining the US Postal Service in order to make it harder to vote by mail: on the 13th August he said tha he was opposing additional funding of the USPS to make it more difficult to deliver mail-in ballots.Trumphas falsely claimed that widespread mail-in voting will lead to fraud and thus has opposed Democratic proposals of $3.6 billion of aid to states to run elections and $25 billion of aid to the postal service.States have so far received only $400 million to aid in running elections despite the expectation of very high turnout forthis year’s election, both in-person and via mail.
The postmaster general,Louis DeJoy, is a major Trump donor and throughout the 15th August, following Trump’s remarks, has been facing demonstrations by protesters outside his Washington DC home. In July, several news organisations reportedthe agency was banning overtime and instructing postal workers to disregard mail if it is delayed on its route to them. There have also recently been photos captured in Portland of post boxes being removed by government vans, reportedly due to ‘significant decline in mail volume’.

It appears the destruction of the postal service is already in motion. It also appears the destruction of this vital service is being engineered on purpose by President Trump, in anticipation ofan election that he is not planned to win, according to the polls.
Andrew Bates, spokesman for Joe Biden the Democrat Presidential Nominee, had this to say:
“The president of the United States issabotaginga basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon, cutting a critical lifeline for rural economies and for delivery of medicines, because he wants to deprive Americans of their fundamental right to vote safely during the most catastrophic public health crisis in over 100 years”
Following this attack on democracy, I, like many others, have been curious as to how destructively (constitutionally) the President of the United States is allowed to act.In Article 1 Section 8, in the powers designated to the legislature, the Constitution states thatCongress ‘is to provide for naturalization, standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads’.It is clearly stated that it is a constitutional right of every citizen of the United States to have a functioning post office, provided for by Congress. In taking the inaugural oath, any President vows to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
The provision for removing a President and all other civil officers from office lies in Article 2 Section 4, stating they ‘shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’. Much of the US Constitution is laid out in these purposefully vague terms, a decision made by the Founding Fathers to allow the Constitution to be flexible to interpretation. According to the Congressional Research Service ‘the notion that only criminal conduct can constitute sufficient grounds for impeachment does not comport with either the views of the founders or with historical practice. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 65, described impeachable offences as arising from “the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust”.
Therefore, it is not unreasonable to believe thatthe destruction of the post office could be considered an impeachable offence.
President Trump has actually already been impeached in 2019. He was charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, following allegations that he had sought help from Ukrainian authorities to favour him in the 2020 election. Trump was acquitted by the Senate, which is currently Republican-controlled, because neither charge for impeachment reached the two-thirds supermajority needed.
According to Article 1 Section 2 of the US Constitution, the Senate has the sole power to hold the trial for all impeachments. Unfortunately, the final vote at the end of Trump’s 2019 trial was decided almost entirely on partisan lines, with all 45 Democrats involved in the trial voting Guilty for both charges, and Senator Mitt Romney being the only Republican to vote Guilty, against party lines.This does not offer much hope for a second impeachment trialhaving any more success than the first, not unless the Republican Senators show any willingness to vote against their President.
The post office remains vulnerable and with the November election on the horizon,mail-in voting is in serious danger. At the time of publication of this article, the House Oversight Committee announced a hearing for 24th August, inviting Postmaster GeneralLouis DeJoyand Postal Service Board of Governors ChairmanRobert M. Duncan, calling back Congress from recess because of the fears that DeJoy is implementing policies that are structurally damaging the mail service in order to create election chaos. However, with Trump’s support (DeJoy being a major donor to his campaign) and a Republican-controlled Senate and House, there do not seem to be many defences left for the postal service, and thus for a lot of voters’ ballots sent via mail.
Over the coming weeks, we may see partisan clashes between Democrats and the GOP as it continues to enable Trump and DeJoy’s attacks. This is a vital time for theUnited States, the ‘leader of the free world’, and we will see if it can survive this latest attack on its citizens constitutional rights and democratic freedom to vote.

[Analysis] What Would Biden’s Victory In The 2020 U.S. Elections Mean For ASEAN?,"2020 signifies ayear of potentialchange for U.S. domestic and foreign politics, either putting an end tothe Trump administrationor allowing it to continue its influence over the world. Research by the academic think-tankPew Research Centreshows that, while views of the U.S. seem favourable across 33 countries, views on the Trump administration are less promising.
Different charts gathering 2019 data, in fact, show studies that demonstrateconfidence in Trump is at an overall low, on a global level. A world map (Figure 1) below visually represents the lack of support of the U.S. from the world’s most powerful and developed economies – never surpassing 40% in overall confidence levels. West Europe, Canada,Russia, Australia, South Africa, and Far East Asia, for instance, seem to demonstrate lack of trust towards Donald J. Trump’s figure. Being some of the longest lasting allies of the U.S., it is unusual to see this data. Interestingly, Kenya, Israel, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe appear more favourable of his presidency.
What is important to point out, however, is thatperceptions of government and the U.S. as a whole completely differ.
This means that, while foreign countries may have low confidence in the Trump administration, their view of the U.S. remains relatively positive. As shown by the chart to the left (Figure 2), Trump’s election in 2016 contributed to a downfall of satisfaction across 24 countries. In 2017, data shows that only 23% of those surveyed in these 24 countries had confidence in Trump as the President of the United States.
In two years, this value grew by only 8%, which demonstrates thatpublic opinion on Trump can overall be considered negative compared to the 74% of support that former President Obamawas benefiting from in 2016. In contrast, while the perspective of America as a whole might have worsened suddenly after the 2016 elections, data remained overall consistent, despite fluctuations between 49% and 53%.
Considering the world’s economic system is unilateral, in the sense that the most important institutions, the IMF, WTO, and UN, (as well as other trading dynamics) occurring daily around the globe are essentially a product of the U.S. economy, this data is worrying.
Historically, countries sensing a disrupting energy coming from the U.S. system of governance have easily turned to emerging powers in past decades. Hence, the focus by experts on the“rise” of China. Like many other countries in Southeast Asia, China has long been the recipient of foreign expertise wishing to make a profit out of cheap production in developing countries. China, which on its side has a legacy of being self-reliant, twisted this phenomenon to its advantage and enriching itself. With the PRC (People’s Republic of China) rising as a powerful economy, the global system is starting to shift towards multilateralism. Figures such as Trump are strong opponents of this view and would prefer the U.S. maintain its pole position. Below we explore what Biden’s approach to foreign policy could imply for U.S.-China competitiveness.
After four years, concluding the first term of President Trump,Biden really could become the next President of the United States. There are, of course, multiple factors that could determine this political change. These mainly express democrats’ concerns over Trump’s rule. 2020 was a particular year that emphasised these worries, for example, theunder-representation of ethnic groups(e.g. Black Lives Matter movements and Anti-Asian sentiment sparked amid the COVID-19 pandemic), theambiguous Twitter-politicsoften used as a means to express Trump’s personal views on political matters rather than the view of the U.S. central government, and also theisolation and anti-diplomatic attitude of the U.S.against emerging powers that it should instead engage in further communication with (e.g. U.S.-China trade war, North Korea antagonism).
While Trump has certainly contributed to the American domestic economy during these years, prioritizing local over foreign workers, and creating opportunities for the U.S. tofoster economic development with a business-centric approach(e.g. Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines), it is true that the Democrat opposition has strengthened significantly.Candidate Joe Biden, former Vice-President during the Obama administration, is possibly gaining votes due to his affiliation to the former president. During his political campaign, Biden’s strategy has sought to repair the wounds left by Trump, claiming his election would value immigration and ethnic issues for long upsetting the American population. Among the strategies to gain as many votes as possible, could potentially be his choice of Kamala Harris as his Vice-President, perhaps wishing to demonstrate that more ethnic groups are being heard directly inside the oval office and that gender balance should exist at the highest levels of the political system.
Due to the historical moment in which the world finds itself, in the midst of a global pandemic, finding a vaccine will be a top priority.Other than the medical side, however, there is also a politico-diplomatic side to this issuebecause the U.S. finds, once again, both Russia and China are the biggest economies working to find the vaccine against COVID-19. While one would hope these all worked together to do so, the reality of foreign politics still sees these countries compete amid a global emergency. From either side, there is oftenmistrust in sharing informationwith foreign medical teams and the political administration, which will inevitably slow the production down.
Aside from Covid-19, Biden’s team has listed a few focuses regarding the foreign policy it would like to pursue if elected. According to theCouncil of Foreign Relations, the main points include:
Biden supports diplomacy with Pyongyang, however, believes that Kim Jong-Un has not madeconcrete plans to eliminate the nuclear program, which he deems a major threat to the world. He also believes that Trump has not utilised his resources to pressure Kim further into making changes and that negotiations with China and an emboldened relationship might be the solution to this.
Calling himself a Zionist, Biden is likely to continue strong cooperation with Israel. However, this may bring further discontent among countries supporting the Palestinian cause. Furthermore, Biden opposes Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal which has failed to keep Tehran from developing its nuclear program, and is also worried about keeping weapons in Turkey under the unpredictable administration of Erdogan. Decisions on Syria are believed to be a big conundrum for the U.S.
Regarding Russia, Biden has expressed wishes that Putin’s government would be further investigated due to suspicious money laundering within Western financial institutions. He believes the Russian government is anti-democratic and, like Trump, he would increase military presence in Ukraine and Eastern Europe via NATO. He is yet to reveal his stance on events concerning Belarus.
Biden believes that helping Venezuela solve the ongoing domestic economic crisis through economic stimulus wouldavoid creating millions of refugeesseeking asylum in the U.S. He points to his focus on Latin America as former vice president, saying that diplomatic ties with Cuba must be reopened, continuing the Obama trade agreements of over US$750 million with Colombia and Panama.
Biden agrees with Trump’s tough approach on China, however, he has been thoroughly criticized for instead being too soft on Beijing. Below, there is an in-depth analysis of the legacy of Biden in dealing with China, from Vice President to now.
When Joe Biden was Vice President for the Obama administration, diplomatic decision-making in Asia undeniably challenged Beijing. The2013 Pivot-to-Asiastrategy remains in history one of the top foreign policies angering China. Later, this was renamed the “Rebalancing” policy, as Washington felt the need to specify that this was not a military strategy aiming to encircle China. Beijing, on the other hand, saw this move as an attempt of the U.S. (world hegemon) to constrain the growing military and economic capabilities of China (emerging power).
Below, a video by VOA (U.S.-based) explains the tensions developing between the U.S. and China, particularly in the South and the East-China Sea, which remain areas of conflict between China and other Asian countries. Back in 2013, coinciding with Xi Jinping’s rise to power, Biden supported Obama’s decision to be tough on China. According to his team’s plans, therefore, one would expect Biden to continue to challenge China for the duration of his presidency, if elected.
However, American newspapers supporting different political factions have heavilycriticisedthis plan, due to the effective personal relations he is said to hold with China. For instance, journalistic sources have condemned the investment decisions made by his son in the region, which would imply Biden is somewhat involved in the Chinese economy. Lately, in fact, Biden’s campaigns have expressed his desire to intensify collaboration with China, sparking public dissent.China seems more in favour of initiating agreements with Bidenrather than continuing relations with Trump, however, this depends on the stance Biden will choose to stand by on the issues ofXinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Beijing is a verysensible government, that willnot easily reach foreign agreements on issues it believes to be of domestic nature. Below on the left, a propaganda video of team Trump, of biased nature, denounces Biden’s soft approach on China. On the right, the perspective of Chinese-based media, the South China Morning Post.
The 2013 Pivot-to-Asia was originally created tosend aid to South-Eastern Asian states militarily by deploying U.S. troopsand naval equipment in the region. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) made up of Brunei, Thailand, Malaysia, The Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Indonesia were therefore protected in this sense. However,the presence of the U.S. in the region has been angering Beijing ever since. In fact, starting as a regional issue, the South China Sea has become a global one, involving other superpowers that are indirectly involved in trade deals or have other interests in the Sea. The South China Sea remains one of the most complex “cold” conflicts of the modern era, as it encompasses strategic straits and ports that contribute to communication and the transport of goods and services worldwide.
According toEurAsian Times, China has attempted to maintain stable bilateral relations with ASEAN countries, calling the most recent meeting in early August 2020 to discuss the involvement of non-regional powers in issues that, according to Beijing, are purely East Asian or Southeast Asian. “Asia is for the Asians” is the slogan repeated frequently by Xi Jinping, valuing ASEAN countries as a strategic and developing bloc. Ironically, the Americans might have indeed listened to these words,involving India and Japan in the South China Sea issueas well. It is no wonder a world power like the U.S. would feel attacked by a coalition of states arising before its eyes, and this has become a reality during Trump’s U.S.-China trade war, which risked turning pro-American countries against China.
Facing pressured from both sides,ASEAN officials have firmly stated they will not choose China or the U.S. In fact, they value maintaining good relationships with both because “what we mustn’t overlook is that ASEAN is not without its own leverage … as an economic bloc, as a strategic bloc, and as a region that both the US and China would like to get along well with,” according to Singaporean Coordinating Minister for Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam. According to the South China Morning Post, ASEAN is open to any newly elected U.S. presidential candidate, saying they will respect any options. On the other hand, President Trump believes that “If I don’t win the election, China will own the United States. You’re going to have to learn to speak Chinese.”  This implies that, according to the current President, the U.S. and other countries in Asia, would no longer be as free or as protected if Biden wins and sides with China. These speculations, however, are too far-fetched to be considered true.
Only time will be able to tell the next steps of American foreign policy, regardless of who wins the elections. In the case of Biden being victorious, then it will be interesting to observe how he will “deal with China“, and how the dynamics between the U.S., China, and ASEAN will change.","September 27, 2020",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/presidential-elections-2020/analysis-what-would-bidens-victory-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-mean-for-asean/,The New Global Order,thenewglobalorder.com,Presidential Elections 2020
Racial Trauma: Should it Be Given More Recognition in the Mental Health Sphere?,"Racial trauma, or Race-Based Traumatic Stress (RBTS) is a form ofmentalandemotional injurycaused by experiences ofracialorethnic discrimination, both individual and systemic. Such experiences could be real or perceived, and they include: physical harm or threats of injury, humiliating or shaming experiences, and dehumanising encounters of abuse, verbal or otherwise. These experiences could cause racial trauma to an individual either directly, vicariously or even intergenerationally.
The recent atrocities on Jacob Blake andGeorge Floyd,have brought much needed attention to racial inequality and racial tensions, both in the United States and globally. This calls into question the effects of such events on the affected families and communities as a whole. Therefore, the conversation on racial trauma urgently needs to be had, now more than ever. There is a pressing need to discuss racial trauma, to raise awareness, and to acknowledge that it needs a bigger lime light in the mental health sphere.
Vicarious experiences act as triggerswhere peoplewitness incidences of racism outside of their personal experience. For example, constant exposure to violent videos involving people from your community such as the infamous videos of police brutality on the African American community in the United States. Members of that community may be strongly effected by such videos, resulting in emotional and mental injury in cases of repeated exposure. Another example of this is the fact that two thirds of Latino youths who migrate to the United States report having gone through a racially traumatising experience during, and post migration, with the most reported traumatic being having witnessed a violent assault on another member of their community.
Intergenerational traumaon the other hand is thepassing down of trauma from one generation to the next. In this context, members of a specific community become more susceptible to mental and psychological disorders due to intense levels of racial violence experienced by previous generations.Trauma can thus pass downfamilies, and even entire communities. For example descendants of Holocaust survivors tend to have higher vulnerability to psychological disturbances. This vulnerability has a direct link to the historical atrocities suffered by their predecessors. Additionally, Native American often experience both vicarious and intergenerational trauma. Younger generations of Native Americans are prone to vicarious trauma as a result of the alarming rates of societal homicide and suicide. However, they also experience historical trauma as a result of the massacres, and forced removal from their tribal lands, which presents a source of communal loss and grief.
Today, amongst persons of colour, black people are the most vulnerable to racial trauma due to the higher levels of racial discrimination and violence they face. Extreme circumstances such as the currentCOVID-19 pandemic, exacerbate levels of discrimination, both individual and systemic. In the United States for instance, due to already the existing social and economic disparities, African Americans are the least equipped to weather the storm. Such situations therefore increase their vulnerability to Racial Based Traumatic Stress.
In severe cases, racial trauma is comparable to a more commonly known mental disorder: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In these casesracial trauma shares many of the PTSD symptomssuch as depression, insomnia, extreme anger, and flashbacks of the traumatising events.  Other common symptoms of racial trauma include: anxiety, hyper-vigilance, avoidance, and low self esteem. Racial trauma may further manifest itself in physical effects such as headaches and chest pains.Although attuned in the aforementioned similarities, unlike PTSD ,Racial Trauma is currently not in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), and is instead classified as a mental injury. As a result, racial trauma is sidelined in mental health practice whereby many non-BIPOC therapists rarely recognise it amongst their affected patients.
According to social welfare specialist Jacqueline Ogorchukwu Iyamah, a major cause for this is that traditionally, thepsychology field has been mainly centred on the white experience. Therefore, most therapists and practitioners lack the cultural competence to diagnose, and effectively treat BIPOC specific conditions such as racial trauma. On the contrary, many BIPOC who seek professional help for issues of racial trauma unfortunately end up gaslit by their therapists. This thus adds to the invalidation and the isolation of racial trauma.
In cases of PTSD, victims are usually able to heal and overcome their trauma through professional help and counselling. The reason being that more often than not, separation of the victims from the original cause of trauma is possible, which facilitates the healing process. Conversely, with racial trauma,healing is almost always an unachievable option. This is as a result of constant re-exposure to those same triggers and experiences either directly or vicariously. In short, for most BIPOC, racial encounters are an embedded part of their everyday lives, and thus in the absence of healing, coping becomes the most viable solution.
Over time therefore, mental health professionals have identifiedseveral effective coping mechanisms for dealing with racial trauma. Firstly, one should identify a culturally competent therapist, equipped to intervene in cases of racial trauma. With regard to this, institutions with mental health resources such as schools, should make an effort to provide adequate resources for their minority population, in solidarity and acknowledgement of their experience. Secondly, activism is another effective coping mechanism as it empowers, and helps one to identify with an understanding community. This sense of belonging helps validate one’s experience, and provides hope to victims of  racial trauma.
Other coping mechanisms include taking breaks from the various triggers in one’s control such as social media, or the news especially in such times of racial tension. While events such as BLM protests may be empowering to those partaking in them, they may also become a source of anxiety and stress especially to members of the affected community. Therefore, occasional breaks from the outside world, and investing in self care are indispensable. Self care practices that have proven to be helpful include meditation, journaling, and exercise. Physical exercise is especially useful as it helps release any pent up trauma that is usually stored in the body. The final piece of advice for those who have experienced gaslighting and invalidation is beautifully summarised by Jacqueline Ogorchukwu:
“Your experience is your expertise”.

What Does The EU Have To Do With Lebanon?,"On August 10, 2020, at the International Conference on Assistance and Support to Lebanon,severely hit by the consequence of a blast in its capital Beirut, theEuropean Unionagreed to €30 million in funding, added to the €33 million funding already promised by the Commission PresidentUrsula Von der Leyenin a phone call with the Lebanese PresidentMicheal Aoun.
Yet, the fact that the European Union is proud to share that monetary aid has not been the only act of European solidarity towards the Lebanese people;it was involved in tangible operations straight after the blast, like the activation of the Copernicus Satellite to assess the damages or the on-site deployment of rescue, chemical and medical experts through the European Civil Protection Mechanism.
TheEuropean International Police Organization, known as INTERPOL, on the request of Lebanese authorities has also deployed one of its “Incident Response Teams” (IRT) to assist not only emergency response, but also investigations on the perpetrators of the disastrous explosion.
The disastrous blast, however, was not the event that marked the beginning of EU-Lebanon relations. It is the prompt continuation of a partnership started in 2002, when theEU-Lebanon Association Agreement was signed. Although enforced only in 2006, when all European member states ratified it, such an accord is not only the legal base for the EU-Lebanon partnership, but it also represents aformal start for Lebanon’s transition to free trade. Since then, the EU has become Lebanon’smain trade partner, with exports to Lebanon estimated to be €7,2 billion in 2017 and imports from Lebanon amounting to  €0,4 billion. The disparity in Lebanese trade balance with the EU is clear, and it may arise doubts on whether such a partnership is really beneficial for Lebanon, which has only slightly improved its economic vulnerability throughout the years.
But Lebanon’s stance in trade might be traced back to Lebanesehistory as a “Merchant Republic,”thus with very low industrial investment and development. The EU has attempted to provide support to Lebanon in this aspect as well. In 2016, the EU agreed to finance the fostering of Lebanon’s entrepreneurial development. The EU, in fact, established a €150 million fund over three years at the CEDRE Conference (Conférence économique pour le développement du Liban par les réformes et avec les entreprises) with the purpose of bringing reforms to Lebanon and revitalising the Lebanese economy.
EU-Lebanon partnership is also strengthened and financially supported through the European Neighbourhood Instrument, that, according to EU sources, focuses on three main areas of development and improvement:
More broadly, the EU has focused on theplanning and implementation of projects of economic reformation, security and migration. Economic reformation is to be based on the ‘green economy’ at municipal level, to upgrade Lebanese infrastructure for water supply, sanitation and waste disposal. As for security, the EU supports a more effective cooperation between the military and civil society and stronger border control operations. Finally, the EU aims to collaborate with Lebanon to control regular and irregular migration paths, especially in regard to the migration of Syrian refugees.
An interesting 2018 report by Karina Goulordava for the Italian international relations think-tankIstituto Affari Internazionali, illustrates the perception of the Lebanese population to EU presence and help in their country. The general feeling does not attribute the EU projects in Lebanon to failure, such as in improving the status quo nor a worse situation. In fact, theLebanese people believe that the EU plays a key role in collaborating with grassroots actorsand in illustrating civil society’s concerns to the central government in order to ensure social, political and economic development of the country.
People’s perception is surely a great indicator to assess EU action inLebanon. At the moment, the EU finds itself in good stead,  both to listen to the Lebanese people, and to cooperate with Lebanese authorities. The Beirut blast is a challenge for the EU’s role in Lebanon, because the European Union will have to demonstrate that, even in an emergency and crisis situation, it maintains its promises and values to protect and strengthen its partnership with non-EU States.

Next Generation EU: Le Plan Européen Pour La Reprise Post COVID-19,"Le 21 juillet dernier marque une date symbolique dans l’histoire de l’Union Européenne. Après plus de quatre-vingt-dix heures de négociations, les Vingt-Sept ont adoptéun plan de relance pourl’Europeafin de faire face à la crise économique due auCOVID-19. L’accord est spécifique et modifie les conditions de ‘Next Generation EU’, le projet de relance économique proposé par la Commission européenne le 27 mai dernier.
« Jour historique pour l’Europe !».C’est ainsi que le président français, Emmanuel Macron, décrit ce qui vient de se réaliser lors du dernier Conseil Européen. Le commentaire de Macron suit le cri de victoire du président du Conseil européen, Charles Michel, qui à 5h32 du matin publie un tweet ensuite devenu viral:«Deal».
En effet, il s’agit véritablement d’un jour historique pour l’Union européenne, et ce pour plusieurs raisons.
Dans le cadre du plan de relance pour l’Europe,la Commission européenne émettra desobligationssur les marchés financiers au nom de l’UE etpour un montant de 750 milliards d’euros, pour la période 2021-2024.
En émettant ce que l’on a nommé les ‘Corona bonds’, l’Union Européenne met à disposition des investissements financiers importants pour les pays les plus frappés par la crise économique résultant de la pandémie, l’Italie et l’Espagne en tête, que l’on désigne avec la Grèce et le Portugal comme les ‘Mediterraneans’. Sans un tel projet, les Mediterraneans n’auraient pas eu les moyens disponibles s’endetter afin de relancer leurs économies, puisqu’ayant déjà des déficits publics parmi les plus hauts d’Europe. Pourtant, en réalisant une mutualisation de dettes publiques des États membres,cette opération concrétise enfin le principe de solidaritétel qu’énoncé dans le Traité de Fonctionnement de l’Union Européenne (‘TFUE’), en adoptant une solution commune pour l’Union européenne toute entière.
Cet accord historique modifie la proposition initiale de la présidente de la Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Cependant, le montant de la valeur des opérations ne change pas: les obligations émises vont garantir un total de 750 milliards d’euros en investissements. Toutefois, c’est la répartition des chiffres destinés aux subventions et prêts qui change. En effet,les subventions vont être de 390 milliards d’euros, au lieu des 500 milliards initialement prévus, alors queles prêts seront de 360 milliards, contrairement aux 250 milliards proposés.
Ce changement s’explique par préoccupations des pays dits ‘frugaux’, à savoir  les Pays-Bas, le Danemark, la Suède et l’Autriche, c’est-à-dire les pays les plus hostiles à un budget européen trop important. Et en effet, siles prêts vont être remboursés par les Etats bénéficiaires entre 2028 et 2058(à de meilleures conditions que celles des marchés),les subventions vont être remboursées par l’ensemble des États membresà travers le budget pluriannuel. Cette opération a pourtant un impact considérable surle prochain cadre financier pluriannuel (CFP) pour la période 2021-2027, qui s’élève à 1824,3 milliards d’euros.
En quoi consistent concrètement les objectifs européens pour la reprise? Selon les accords, le plan de relance Next Generation EU se fonde surtrois piliers fondamentaux.
Le premier, qui prévoit la majorité des financements, est destiné àaider les États membres à se remettre de la crise, en soutenant les investissements et les réformes, ainsi qu’une transition juste, c’est-à-dire une transition écologique vers une économie neutre pour le climat.
Le second pilier vise àstimuler les investissements privés et aider les économies nationales, en renforçant surtout le programme InvestEU et en prévoyant un nouvel instrument de soutien à la solvabilité.
Enfin, le troisième pilier est désigné àtirer les enseignements de la crise. Pour la plupart, il s’agit d’élaborer un nouveau programme pour la santé, afin que les systèmes sanitaires soient prêts pour une autre (éventuelle) pandémie voire épidémie, et renforcer RescEU, le mécanisme de protection civile de l’UE.
En analysant ces objectifs, il est évident qu’il s’agit d’un plan ambitieux, qui nécessite un budget important.La majorité des fonds a été accordée à l’Italie, qui crie victoire en obtenant 209 milliards d’euros partagés entre subventions et prêts. Suivent l’Espagne et la France, qui obtiennent respectivement 140 (subventions et prêts) et 40 (subventions uniquement) milliards d’euros.
Comment les pays pourront-ils accéder à ces fonds?
Instituer une dette commune implique le respect de conditions de la part des pays les plus frappés par la crise afin de garantir ceux qui, à travers leurs bilans nationaux, vont rendre possible l’émission des subventions.
Il est donc prévu que les pays bénéficiaires du plan présenteront au préalableun programme de réformes et d’investissementsjusqu’en 2023, en respectant plusieurscritères environnementaux et économiques. Chaque pays devra destiner 30% des fonds aux objectifs européens sur la neutralité climatique, notamment celui de neutralité carbone à l’horizon 2050. De plus, chaque État devra respecter le semestre européen, c’est-à-dire la coordination des politiques économiques et budgétaires au sein de l’UE, en matière de réformes structurelles et face à la prévention des déséquilibres macroéconomiques.
Bien que les Pays-Bas et les autres pays frugaux aient fait pression sur le point,les États membres ne pourront pas faire valoir leur veto sur les plans nationaux présentés à la Commission: pour l’accès aux fonds, il suffira que les Vingt-Sept approuvent les projets avec une majorité qualifiée. Cependant, si un État membre considère qu’un plan national ne respecte pas les critères définis, il pourra demander que soit saisi Conseil européen. Après l’approbation des plans, le versement de70% du montant aura lieu entre 2021 et 2022, alors que les 30% restants seront versés en 2023.
Pour la première fois dans l’histoire de l’Union européenne,le versement pourra être suspendu en cas des violations de l’État de droitet de la démocratie. Il s’agit d’une mesure visant à protéger les principes fondateurs de l’UE face aux dérives de certains pays, surtout la Hongrie et la Pologne, deux régimes nationalistes qui ont sacrifié la liberté d’expression et de la presse, selon les dires de Bruxelles, et qui risquent de commettre des violations de droits fondamentaux sous le prétexte d’assumer pleins pouvoirs pour faire face à cette pandémie.
L’approbation de l’accord n’est pas simple. Cela est notamment le cas parce qu’il est inévitablement lié au budget financier.
Le 23 juillet dernier, à travers une résolution adoptée par une large majorité,le Parlement Européen a menacé de ne pas approuver l’accordtrouvé par les chefs d’État si un autre n’était pas trouvé.
L’approbation du Parlement n’est pas nécessaire pour mettre en place les fonds de relance de 750 milliards, mais les eurodéputés doivent se prononcer sur le cadre financier pluriannuel (CFP) avant la fin de l’année, sur lequel le plan de relance est adossé.
L’accord est considéré insatisfaisant, de même que le budget approuvé, de 1074 milliards, contre le 1100 proposés par la Commission et le 1300 par le Parlement. D’après une vaste majorité de partis, descoûts inconciliables avec les objectifs du planont été apportés. Par exemple, les eurodéputés dénoncent des fonds insuffisants sur le plan de la santé et de la recherche, mais aussi dans le domaine du climat et de la mobilité des jeunes à travers des projets comme Erasmus+.
Le Parlement a le pouvoir d’approuver ou rejeter le budget, non pas de l’amender. En conséquence, de nouvelles négociations devront avoir lieu entre le Parlement et le Conseil.
Les politiques pour l’environnement, la mise en place de réformes structurelles dans le domaine économique et le respect de l’État de droit: voir les trois conditions pour avoir accès aux fonds européens, mais surtout pour écrire le futur de l’Europe après la pandémie.
Le monde entier fait face à une récession sans précédent, et l’Union Européenne lui fait face avec courage et ambition. La solidarité européenne trouve, dans le Next Generation EU, une application concrète. Les pays du Sud bénéficieront d’opportunités pour relancer leurs économies, affaiblies depuis la crise du 2008.
Les parlements nationaux auront la responsabilité d’élaborer des plans structurés et ambitieux avant la fin du 2020, afin de les présenter au début de l’année prochaine. Les leaders politiques devront écouter la population et prendre des décisions en ligne avec les nouveaux défis du XXI siècle, parmi lesquels le changement climatique.Il faudra adopter une vision à long terme, et ce afin de faire des investissements structurels qui seront à même de favoriser la reprise économique.
Bruxelles est prête: est-ce que les États membres le sont aussi?

The Women of Belarus: From Tradition To Revolution,"On August 9, 2020, the presidential election took place in Belarus. Two people ended up holding power: on one side PresidentAlexander Lukashenkoand on the other sideSvetlana Tikhanovskaya. Although President Lukashenko won, the main opponent, Tikhanovskaya, and the election itself changed the current status quo of Belarus.
President Lukashenko has been president ofBelarussince 1994 and has been in the centre of attention because of his leadership. An idolizer of the Soviet Union and its old traditions, President Lukashenko has been a contradictory figure and has shaped the society’s mentality, also for what concerns the role of the woman, which has been disputed for a long time. In fact, unlike in western Europe, where women have become more prominent and independent in various sectors of society,Belarusis still nowadays centred on the belief that women are “the brunt of housework and caretaking”.
Amnesty International made several researches about this situation and published areport“Crackdown from the top: Gender-based reprisals against women activists in Belarus” on July 17 2020. In the report, Amnesty international declares that women in Belarus “are subjected to gender-based stereotyping and discrimination grounded in patriarchal notions of gender roles which present them as ‘vulnerable’ and ‘weak’, deny them control over their bodies and reductively frame them in caring or parental roles and responsibilities”. In addition to that, Amnesty International urges the Belarusian government to stop “all reprisals against women and end the practice of targeting women activists with gender-specific intimidation and threats of gender-based violence”. This anti-feminist mentality can also be seen in one of President Lukashenko’s latestannouncements, declaring that Belarus’ “constitution is not for women. [The Belarusian] society has not matured enough to vote for a woman”.
However, three women,Veronika Tsepkalo,Maria Kolesnikova, andSvetlana Tikhanovskaya, decided to unite against President Lukashenko, willing to change this old-fashioned mentality of the Belarusian society.
The main opponent, Tikhanovskaya, a former English teacher and housewife, decided to run for presidency after her husband Sergei, a famous anti-government Youtuber, tried to register as a candidate for the election and got arrested.  After announcing her candidacy, Tikhanovskaya  and her two supporters became more and more powerful on medias and have also became famous for using these symbols: “✌✊❤.” This has also to do with the fact that the two women that accompany Tikhanovskaya are extremely powerful, as Veronika Tsepkalo is the wife of former diplomat Valery Tsepkalo, while Maria Kolesnikova was the campaign manager of Viktor Babaryko, an opposition candidate that got disqualified. Hence, these two women have showed the population how a woman can play an influential role in political events since, together, they strengthen theimage of the womanand “challenge[d] Lukashenko’s patriarchal rule”.
This new image of the woman and its political vision has been revolutionary to the Belarusian society, as seen on July 30, 2020, when tens of thousands Belarusians attended Tikhanovskaya’s rally in Minsk, becoming thus a real threat to President Lukashenko. Although President Lukashenko has first underestimated his opponent, thinking that Tikhanovskaya would be too weak and pressured, when she actually received a lot of influence and support from the population, the government banned the rest of her rallies, as well as arresting several members of her campaign and supporters.
On August 9, 2020, the presidential election resulted with President Lukashenko’s victory withmore than 80% of the votes. Seen as rigged in order to let President Lukashenko win and fearing for retaliation and backlash from the government, Tikhanovskaya fled the following day to Lithuania, asking for honest election and the re-counting of the votes. The same happened with Veronika Tsepkalo, who fled to Poland, whileMaria Kolesnikova stayed in Belarus until she was reportedly kidnapped by Belarusian security agents, who allegedly wanted to expulse her to Ukraine.
Immediately after the release of the election results, the Belarusian population took actively part in anti-government protests and rallies throughout the country, asking for fair elections and the resignation of President Lukashenko. On the same night, protests took place and the police implemented security measures, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets, in order to disperse the crowds. Thepolice arrested  3.000 protestersjust on the first day and one protester was killed during a rally by allegedly being run down by a police vehicle. Since then, the Belarusian people has been non-stop protesting in Minsk and neighbouring towns, clashing violently with security forces, causing severe disruptions, and getting arrested.
Amid the violent protests throughout the country, Belarusian women have recently become more and more prominent in these events. On August 12, hundreds of women dressed in white were on the first rows of the protest, while waving flowers in the air and hugging police officers. The women took place in the protests to demand the end of violence from the security forces towards the protesters.
The same happened recurrently in the last fours weeks: for example, on September 5, more than 5,000 women formed a solidarity chain, demanding President Lukashenko’s resignation and the end of police brutality. According to reports, the security forces followed these protests, but, unlike to the first protests, did not arrest anyone. As such, these women are playing an influential role in the current events and have become more prominent figures in the protests and for changing the society. This is of enormous importance, as thisway“alters the protest strategy, pitting peaceful resistance against state violence”.
In addition to that, this new change and rise of the woman in politics is also due to Tikhanoskaya, Kolesnikova, and Tsepkalo. In fact, Tikhanovskaya, who was a simple housewife with no political experience, became the opposition leader of the country, and thus the three of them helped getting the women involved in the protests and engaging them in the domestic politics and its society.
These events are currently of utter importance, as the women are becoming more and more involved in the protests, as they want to change the old-traditions and participate more in the current events. Although this first step is absolutely important in changing the society,the road ahead is still long.

Johnson & Brexit Britain: Rule-Breaking Bad Boys?,"*DISCLAIMER:This article is part of a developing story with the bill now having passed the House of Commons and the EU in the process of taking legal actions*
As we have come to expect over the past 4 years, there has been a further twist in this saga called Brexit. Eyebrows were raised during the COVID19 crisis whenBoris Johnsonand his government decided to let the June deadline for aBrexit Dealextension request expire. This reluctance to extend has left both parties in the extremely difficult situation of having to agree on a Brexit deal before the end of 2020 as well as fighting one of the largest and most deadly pandemics ever seen on this planet.
As we have seen during the COVID-19 crisis,Mr. Johnson has attempted to cover up any Brexit discussions or problems with other news. On Tuesday evening, with this story breaking, the PM once again covered his tracks by announcing a reduction in social bubbles for people in England, which has caused mass confusion and backlash in the UK.
Over the last few days, we have seen news coming out of Downing Street regarding Boris and his reluctance to stick to the original withdrawal agreement agreed and passed by both the European and UK Parliaments. But why?
Well, the drama all stems from the UK’s new“Internal Market” bill.The legislation, set out by the government on Wednesday, gives the UK government the power to define which goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be “at risk” of ending up in the Republic of Ireland and, therefore, subject to tariffs. However,this legislation directly contradicts a fundamental aspect of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and theEU. This agreement stated that this process would be a decision for a Joint Committee, made up of representatives from both the UK and the EU.
The “Internal Market” bill does not only go against this principle but it also allows the UK to remove the need for export declarations for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, another decision that was meant to be discussed in this Joint Committee. It, therefore,enables the UK to decide whether EU state aid laws affecting firms in Northern Ireland should be appliedto linked firms in Great Britain.
When queried about the bill and its rather questionable content in the House of Commons, Tory MP and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis reassured MPs that the plans will only “break international law in a very specific and limited way“- notion that raised the eyebrows of international commentators.
However, just the day before Mr. Lewis’ comments, Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson stated that “We (the UK Government) are fully committed to implementing the Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol and we’ve already taken many practical steps to do so.” Thenwho are we to believe in this predicament?
Well, seeing as these aspects do feature in the bill, which you can readhere, Mr. Lewis seems to be telling the truth with his willingness to break international law. After all,we have already seen Boris break the law before, with his illegal prorogation of Parliament back in 2019.
This clearintention to violate international lawhas drawn criticism from many, including from within the Conservative Party and former Prime Minister Theresa May herself, who asked:
“How can the government reassure future international partners that the U.K. can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?”
The worries of Mrs. May are valid; this draws into serious doubt thecredibilityof any agreement signed by the British government. Moreover, the moves of the government will not help the already tense relations between the EU and the UK in a bid to find a suitable EU-UK Trade Deal.The chances of a No-Deal Brexit are increasing by the minute,betraying not only the general public but also “Leave” voters, sold the vision of a Brexit deal, even by Mr. Johnson himself, who famously argued that “There is no plan for no-deal because we are going to get a great deal”.
Only time will tell if this is yet another Boris Johnson U-turn.
However, the EU on Thursday called on the UK government to withdraw aspects of the draft Internal Market Bill “in the shortest time possible and in any case by the end of the month,” or face its “number of mechanisms and legal remedies” to address “violations” of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.Therefore, it is hard to see positive changes in the negotiations anytime soon.
The talks over a Brexit Deal continue, and the saga is one to follow over the next months as proceedings seem to be fast approaching their deadline, no matter what that may be.

Infrastructure and Over-Exploitation: Draining Mexico City Dry,"Mexico City currently lies as one of the top 10 citiesmost likely to run out of waterin the next decade. This tragic phenomenon seems unusual, considering the city receives more rainfall than famously soggy London, and the fact it was built on top of a 2000 square feet lake.
There aremultiple factorscausing the city’swater shortages, the first of which being that for the past 400 years, infrastructure development and urban planning has focused on making sure that the short and tempestuous rainfall it receives does not flood the city, and cause severe destruction to homes, roads and citizens. Meanwhile, 50% of the city’s water supply is pumped out of aquifers, draining groundwater and the remains of the lake, but these water sources have taken millennia to fill and will take millennia to replenish.
With rainwater being forced out of the city as quickly as possible, this replenishing will take even longer.20% ofMexico’s 162 million citizens, amounting to around 27 million,live in the capitalcausing a larger strain on the water resources available with its current infrastructure. On top of the limited water, studies in 2016 have shown that at least 32 aquifers have been identified with saltwater intrusion, making them unsuitable for human consumption. According to recent statistics, around 40% of water is being lost.
“Mexico’s rainy season is intense and demonstrates that water is naturally meant to be a part of the landscape. Mexico City, the country’s capital, currently has one of the largest populations in the world, and its citizens are desperate for water.”
Historically, Mexico City looked a lot like Venice, utilising canals and water systems that left arriving Spanish colonisers in awe. It was theseconquistadorsthat began the process away from indigenous water techniques, instead investing in tunnels and trenches to drain water out of the Basin of Mexico, and facilitating practices such as the construction of dams, destruction of woodlands, and diversion of water from lakes and canals that have contributed to the crisis Mexico finds itself in today.
Despite the scarcity of water, consumption remains at a high level for farmers, with76.8% of water being used for agriculture, and the public using less than a quarter of the supply (13.9%). This is partly due to low tariffs on water, which officials have attempted to address in a 2003 modification of the National Water Law, creating a National Water Financial System, but this legislation is yet to be implemented, and further talks regarding the issue in 2015 achieved little progress. The average tariff per m3 is US $0.32 whereas according to a 2012 survey by the GWI, across 310 cities, the average charge was US $1.98 per m3.
Water shortages are a global issue and by 2040,most of the world will not be able to meet year-round water demands. Furthermore, agricultural over-usage of water supply is not a problem confined to Mexico: 74 litres of water are used in the production of every beer, 130 litres in every coffee, but usage rises to an extreme 2500 litres for every t-shirt and the really exorbitant amounts lie in the meat industry:5909 litres of water are required per burger. The reason these products are so cheap compared to their water usage is the low water tariffs. The fashion and meat industry are two major exploiters of water across the globe and the development of globalised trading practices has enhanced the issue ofindustries treating water as an infinite resource. Water is finite – despite Earth’s enormous oceans and gallons of groundwater, 97% of its supply is saline, and 2% lies far below the surface, leaving only 1% appropriate for human, plant and animal consumption. The surface stocks of water replenish, but practices of over-exploitation and ‘freshwater salinization’ (human activity such as agriculture, construction, and resource extraction that lead to freshwater sources becoming saline) are reducing this generation’s access to these safe waters.
We are honoured to have had the opportunity to have had a discussion with Andrea Lefranc, a graduate in Biology in the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) born and bred in Mexico City.
What do you see as being the main issues contributing to the water crisis?
I think it’s mostly an infrastructure issue, or rather lack thereof. It is estimated that about 40% of the water we get from either the aquifers or the Cutzamala System is being lost due to leakage form the city’s faulty pipeline, which gets more damaged as Mexico City continues to sink. Moreover, the local government’s interest in investing in long term solutions seems to be relegated to seeking the voters’ approval by making campaign promises that they have failed to keep so far.
How does the crisis affect you, your family, and your friends?
Water scarcity is fortunately not something with which I’ve had to deal since I moved to the house in which I currently live because it has a pretty hefty cistern. Also, the extent to which one is affected by water shortages depends greatly on the part of the city in which you live. The most economically vulnerable areas are the most affected by them and, ironically, by flooding. I would say that for me personally the constant floods are way more of an issue. They will sometimes make it completely impossible to move around in the city, regardless of the means of transportation you choose.
How do you believe this crisis could be resolved, what steps could be taken?
The problem of over-exploitation definitely has to be addressed, but I don’t think that can be solved in less than a decade. Realistically, rainwater harvesting systems are probably our best shot. The volume of rainwater we get yearly is more than twice what we get from the Cutzamala system, which is more than enough to give the aquifers some space to recover. There is currently one project that stands out called Isla Urbana (Urban Island) that has installed over 20,000 systems, which can provide access to water for up to 9 months of the year, if not more. If the government were to seriously invest in these systems (as well as in water infiltration surfaces) we would be simultaneously mitigating water scarcity and periodical flooding.

The Effect of Novichok: The Case of Navalny and The EU-Russia Relations,"On a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on August 20,Alexei Navalny, an influential opposition leader in Russia, fell ill and the plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Omsk, where Navalny was brought urgently to the hospital. It turned out that Navalny was poisoned with the toxicNovichoknerve agent, allegedly from a water bottle of the hotel where he was staying.
At the hospital in Omsk, Navalny fell into a coma however, at first his doctors did not want to disclose any information regarding Navalny’s current situation, and then later they denied the claims that he had been poisoned. German authorities wanted to immediately fly Navalny to Germany for medical treatment, but Russian doctors argued that he was physically not stable enough to travel. According toAnastasia Vasilyeva, Navalny’s personal doctor, the Russian doctors “ha[ve] tried to delay his departure long enough for the poison in his system to diminish and become difficult or impossible to identify”.
Nevertheless, Germany insisted and on August 22, they flew him to the Charité hospital in Berlin. After several tests, German doctors announced on September 2 that they found traces of the toxic nerve agent in his blood, skin and urine, which was also later confirmed by medical laboratories in France and in Sweden. On September 7, the doctors announced that Navalny was out of the coma, and a week later, on September 15, that he was awake and breathing without the ventilator. He also declared that he has been planning to come back to Russia. According to Navalny’steam, Navalny was allegedly poisoned followingPresident Vladimir Putin’s command.
Alexei Navalny is the main Russian opposition leader and critic of President Putin’s government and he is an anti-corruption activist. He founded theAnti-Corruption Foundationto investigate and research the Kremlin.
For example, in 2017 hediscoveredthat Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had a $1 billion network of palaces. Following the discovery, Navalny became more and more influential and is now a prominent figure in the opposition in Russia. In 2013, he ran for the mayoral election in Moscow and gained only 27% of the votes, although he claimed that it was a fraud. He has also attempted to run for president in 2018 but with no success because he was barred from running. Nevertheless, by being a top opposition leader, he has targeted several times allegedly by the Russian authorities.
In 2014, Navalny was sentenced to five years of prison for embezzlement, even though the sentence was suspended and the case was declared unfair by the European Court of Human Rights, and in 2020, Russia froze the bank accounts of Navalny and his family. Navalny has also received multiple physical threats: for example, in 2019, he received treatment at the hospital following an “acute allergic reaction” after being detained, although his personaldoctorclaimed that it was due to a chemical substance.
It is not the first time that Russian opposition activists and Kremlin critics have been harassed, injured, or even killed and it is not the first time that Russian authorities allegedly used the Novichok nerve agent.Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and Kremlin critic, was allegedly poisoned during a local flight. Although she survived it, she was shot two years later. Another opposition activist,Pyotr Verzilov, declared he had the same symptoms like Navalny’s in 2018, which put him on a ventilator and received treatment in Germany.Aleksandr Litvinenko, former Russian intelligence officer, died in 2006 from drinking tea with Polonium 210. The same happened with opposition leaderVladimir Kara-Murza, who died in 2015 from poisoning. Lastly,Sergei Skripal, former Russian spy, was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent allegedly from the Russian secret services, but survived and recovered.
The poisoning of Sergei Skripal had already brought condemnations by the EU, and moreover, several European countries, including the UK, expelled 150 Russian diplomats and put into force multiple sanctions against Russia. Navalny’s attack has also been playing a central role in the current international relations between Russia and the European countries.GermanyandFrancehave called for an investigation of the attack . On September 14, they both asked Russia to illustrate the events and to cooperate with the investigations. France’sPresident Emmanuel Macroncalled President Putin to ask for clarifications, but PresidentPutindismissed the request by saying that “it was ‘inappropriate’ to make groundless accusations against Russia over the Navalny case”.
On September 17, theEuropean Parliamentadopted aresolution, which denounces the attack on Navalny and declares that the Novichok nerve agent “can only be developed in state-owned military laboratories and cannot be acquired by private individuals, which stronglyimplies that Russian authorities were behind the attack”. In addition to that, the members of the European Parliament regarded this attack as “systematic effort to silence dissident voices in Russia”. As such, the resolution requests an investigation into the attack, as well as the implementation ofsanctionsagainst Russia.
Another consequence in the current intra-state relations is the issue of theNord Stream 2, a gas pipeline project that should carry gas from Russia to mainly Germany, which would get Russia to have a leading and influential role in Europe. Following the attack, ChancellorAngela Merkelhas been pressured to suspend the project both from the European Parliament and from other countries. This event has been heavily criticized from the Russian authorities, as the Russian diplomat Vladimir Chizhovdeclaredthat “it was absurd to try to link the situation around Alexey Navalny’s alleged poisoning to the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline”.
All in all, the attack on Navalny gained international attention, as well as influence in Russia. In fact, the regional elections inTomsk, where Navalny was staying to make propaganda for the opposition, and inNovosibirskresulted in the winning of council seats for the opposition candidates, allies of Navalny.

"Belarus: Protests, Politics and Outlook","Relentless pro-democracy protests in Belarus have been taking place for over a month now, despite intensified government repression. While resistors to Alexander Lukashenko’s regime maintain their rejection of the 9th August election result, the regime maintains its crackdown on the uprising. Increasing international focus on the country’s political crisis has placed foreign actors either on the side of Lukashenko or his opposition, which is headed by candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Thus, the fight for democracy is no longer exclusive to Belarus’ borders. Instead, it has moved to the global sphere as different international players try to pull Belarus in different directions.
Now deemed illegitimate, the Belarusian government faces widespread conviction that it has falsified the August election results. Officially, Lukashenko won an80.1% majority, howeverpolling evidenceshows Tsikhanouskaya was the rightful winner. Belarusian protestors consequently took to the streets, demanding Lukashenko steps down. Through the use of repressive tactics likeexcessive force, detention, and abuse, the government is also subject to global condemnation for its actions toward protestors. Despite the global criticism, however, Lukashenko has moved ahead with his presidency via aninauguration ceremonyon the 23rd September. Many international actors have therefore focused foreign policy initiatives on supporting Belarusian protestors and their demands, particularly the demand for a new, free and fair election.
Russia and the European Union have emerged as some of the most prominent international voices throughout the protests. The European Union has been persistent in its stance against Alexander Lukashenko and in helping Belarusians achieve their cause. The United States has followed suit, despite accusations it is one of the key actors propelling Belarus’ opposition movement. The President of Belarus has, however, had a friend amid the political crisis sweeping his country. Russia’s Vladimir Putin has stood firmly at Lukashenko’s side since the onset of the uprising.
We are therefore witnessing the evolvement of a larger political clash between east and west. Players like Russia and the EU have exhibited conflicting interests where the current situation in Belarus is concerned. On a larger scale, rivalling visions of democracy, freedoms and human rights are at play.
Russia has been clear in its support for Alexander Lukashenko. Aside from declaring political support for the leader, Putin has also extended monetary and military support. The Belarusian regime will receive a$1.5 billion loan, areserve police forceto be dispatched when necessary, and the organisation ofjoint military exercisesto take place on a monthly basis. Putin’s assistance demonstrates the immense interest Russia has in keeping Lukashenko in power and helping him to combat any incoming challenges.
The extension of defence mechanisms and an economic care package that will help mitigate the impact of anunfolding economic crisisdo come at a price, however. Shared government institutions like joint military training schemes haverenewed previously expressed interest in deepening the Union of the two states. Foreign actors have already raised concerns over Russia undermining Belarus’ sovereignty as a result, due to it being a much larger, more powerful and more resourceful counterpart. High Representative of the EU Josep Borrell haswarned that Russian involvement in Belarus’ political crisis can threaten Belarus’ independence. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has alsoexpressed concernsover Russian disruption to Belarus’ sovereignty and the whole region.
Furthermore, a financial loan will lead to future Russian involvement in Belarus at least on economic grounds. Repayment for the loan will most likely lead toRussian take-over of Belarus state-owned companies and greater involvement in Belarus’ oil industry. Therefore, even without political and military integrative initiatives, ties between the two countries will become inevitably stronger via Russia’s economic assistance alone. While the loan will help Lukashenko and his government cope with Belarus’ economic crisis and incoming sanctions, it will also mean greater Russian influence and control in the country. Despite this, Lukashenko has expressed enthusiasm for Putin’s support. The leader emphasises the friendship between unified Russia and Belarus, referring to Putin as his‘older brother’.
The European Union hasdenounced Lukashenko’s regime, the role it has played in falsifying the Belarusian presidential election, and its violent response to domestic protests. Despite recent complications caused byCyprus’ derailment of planned sanctions against Belarus, the EU has been firm in its agenda to punish at least 40 Belarusian officials for their recent actions. Sanctions would includeasset freezes, travel bans, and a prolonged ban on Belarusian arms sales.
Poland and Lithuania have been among the most vocal EU countries to declare support for Belarusian protestors. Both countries have proved particularly resourceful as refuge points for Belarusian opposition leaders and activists following Lukashenko’s crackdown on the movement. Opposition leaderVeronika Tsepkalo relocated to Poland, while candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was taken in by Lithuania. Poland has been providinglevels of aidto Belarusian protestors and their cause: hospital treatment for those injured in protests, an aid package to sponsor work/study in Poland, and financial support for independent Belarusian media in Poland. Lithuania has also been vocal in itssupport for Belarusian protestorsand their demands for democracy in the nation.
EU countries, and the institution as a whole, have maintained a consistent rhetoric in their statements and actions regarding Belarus. They outline the need to preserve a common European vision of freedom and democracy. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki referred to protestors asshowing Europe ‘they want to belong to a Europe of free, democratic nations under the rule of law’. Lithuania’s Linas Linkevicius illustrated the Belarusian protests as atest of European values, which include a liberal democratic society. Belarus’ refusal to align with regional goals is a driving factor in the EU’s denouncement of the governing regime.
However, the EU still faces a collective dilemma. Talks on sanctions have been careful when it came to Lukashenko. There isongoing debateas to whether the leader should be placed on sanctions lists alongside other Belarusian officials. The European Parliament has presented a decisiveResolutionto the bloc, calling for Lukashenko to be sanctioned as well. Sanctioning Lukashenko as an individual dampens any prospect for future dialogue with him, and therefore hopes of persuading him to consider the opposition’s demands. Moreover, EU-imposed repercussions pose a danger of pushing Lukashenko further to the east, away from a common European vision, and into Russia’s arms. The dilemma is this: to what extent can the EU punish a leader whose cooperation it still requires?
Safeguarded by its geographical distance from the region, the U.S. has provided a relatively slower response to the Belarusian protests, compared to the EU and Russia. Nevertheless, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. would follow in the EU’s footsteps andconsider sanctions against Belarusian officials. It is not clear yet whether such sanctions will target Lukashenko. However, Pompeo has been vocal about his country’s strong disapproval of the repression faced by protestors in Belarus.
This has not, however, stopped speculation surrounding the U.S.’ role in boosting the Belarusian opposition movement and inciting political protests across the nation. Alexander Lukashenko has recentlystated his convictionthat the U.S. is behind the Belarusian uprising, orchestrating the people of Belarus, with the help of the global west, to challenge the regime. Director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin hassupported the accusationsby claiming to have evidence that the U.S. has been funding Belarusian opposition groups in the lead up to the election. The U.S. has not yet provided a response to the accusations. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya hasdisputed the claimsby stressing that the situation in Belarus is ‘an internal political crisis’; any remarks suggesting otherwise are attempts to distract from the regime’s actions.
While the EU is still debating whether to prioritize an open dialogue with Lukashenko or impose necessary punishments for his political wrongdoings, the Belarusian leader has welcomed Russia’s support with open arms. Finding hostility from his western neighbours to be an attack campaign spearheaded by the U.S., Lukashenko has shown more faith in Putin’s relief despite the liability this will place on Belarus in the future. The EU is nonetheless still trying to maneuver through planned sanctions while figuring out ways to gain Lukashenko’s cooperation.

“Impunity And Human Rights Cannot Coexist”: When Is The Truce?,"“Impunity and human rights cannot coexist”. These are the words ofThomas Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights inMyanmar, used to describe the mounting perilous situation in a particular state of the southeast Asian country, Rakhine.
Clashes in Rakhine between theArakan Army (AA), the largest armed group that seeks independence for Rakhine and defined as a terrorist group by the Myanmar government, andMyanmar military corps called Tatmadaw, have raised ever-increasing concerns about the infringement of fundamental human rights. After the brutal clearance operations of 2017, the mostly Muslim Rohingya were forced to flee to Bangladesh. In recent months, because of an escalation of hostilities, the UN urges, once again, the parties to respect international humanitarian law and to protect civilians. In fact, according to theReport of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights:
“There was a significant increase in incidents of airstrikes by fighter jets, and helicopter and heavy artillery attacks, and in ground battlesin more densely populated civilian areas”.
Moreover,
“During the first five months of 2020, at least 137 civilians were reportedly killed and 386 wounded, including women, children, and elderly persons.”
The attacks targeted schools, religious sites, and civilian homes. On top of this, the Arakan Army has allegedly committed human rights violations, including laying of landmines in civilian areas. The number of internally displaced persons has increased, due toCOVID-19and added factors such as lack of resources and the deterioration of living conditions,Rohingya have become even more dependent on humanitarian aid.
The last attack was registered on 3rd September, which seriously damaged the villages of Hpa Yar Phaung and Taung Pauk where many homes were burned and civilians forced to flee. The UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Ola Almgren, on 8th September said in a statement on the impact of conflict in western Myanmar, addressed the parties
“To allow humanitarian access to the areas affected, and to heed the Secretary-General’s call for a global cease-fire to enable efforts to prevent and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic”.
In conclusion, the OHCHR report reiterates concerns about general impunity for human rights violations, which should be not only brought before a court but also be accompanied by transitional justice processes.

Star Trek: Journey into the Fictional Representation of Politics,"On September 8th1966,  the first episode of a new and highly conceptual sci-fi series calledStar Trekaired on NBC. The show, created by Gene Roddenberry and set in the distant future of the 24thcentury, followed the adventure of the USS Enterprise and its crew, as their vessel ventured the galaxy  “To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before”.
Star Trek quickly became a cultural phenomenon, and it remained so for decades. Indeed, the longevity of this series and its various iteration (currently counting 6 TV series and 12 movies adaptations) have made this show an icon of pop culture, spanning generations and appealing to an ever-growing fan basis. However, behind the mainstream appeal of the show, resides amuch deeper conceptthat the creators intended for the show.
The core ofStar Trekrevolves around the idea of humanity, once on the brink of extinction, overcoming its issues of race,war, poverty, greed and advancing as a society.In this utopian future of the 24thcentury, humanity has become a beacon of hope for the universe, and through Star Fleet and the Federation (the future counterpart of our United Nations) they engage in exploration and discovery to scout space not for conquering; yet for engaging with other alien species, other cultures and ideals, and in general with other beings that can continue to better their already advanced society.
Star Trekalso drewmajor inspiration from the political and social environment of the time. These events drastically characterised the ethos and morality of the show, as well as creating a more vivid world for the audience. This is something that was extremely relevant in the early iteration of the series, but was completely neglected in the more modern iteration ofStar Trekin favour of mindless action and mainstream appeal. For the sake of our analysis, we are going to compare The Original Series (TOS) and The Next Generation (TNG) to the more modern shows, as to figure out why things have so drastically changed.
At its origin, the show was based on the political view of its creator Roddenberry. His generation was rising from the rubble of World War II, and in their eyestheUnited Nationswas going to be a symbol of prosperity, technological progress and universal humanitythat would help the world heal after the war, much like the fictional Federation is for the show.This was the moral foundation of the series: a fictional journey in the stars which reflected the hopes for the future of a world that was scarred by war and suffering. Therefore, this optimistic view of liberalism and its virtue permeated all the characters of the early series and was rooted in the protagonist of the original series, the legendary captain of the EnterpriseJames T. Kirk.
Speaking of which, it is crucial in the understanding of the ethos and storyline ofStar Trekto focus on the various captains of the different shows. Indeed, as former show runnerDavid Gerroldwrote in 1973:
“When Star Trek was at its best, the captain’s decisions were the focus of the episode.If Star Trek had been a truly dramatic series, then the essential Star Trek story would not have had to have been ‘Kirk in Danger,’ but ‘Kirk Has a Decision to Make.’
The decision is the core of every dramatic episode.”
Hence, the different character traits that differentiateKirkfromPicard, actuallyreflected the different political and ethical standthat each show was going to tackle. Therefore, in the early 70s we haveKirk, an inspiring and bold leader, who in many ways was created to emulate a real-life political symbol of the time,John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
As noted by writerPaul Cantorin his essay,Kirkin many ways replicates the actions and the persona ofKennedyduring the Cold War. His charisma and ability to inspire the crew even in the darkest situations, as well as his uncompromising views on liberal ideas and refusal of totalitarianism very much reprised the American president. The humanist view of The Original Series on totalitarianism as a dehumanising process that sets back the advancement of civilizations somewhat summarises the American political propaganda during the Cold War. In TOS, the politics of the show was inspired by the technocratic liberalism of welfare state and secular culture that theKennedyadministration sought to apply.
Then, after a fairly unsuccessful run on TV and a series of well received movies,Star Trekwasrebooted in 1987with a new series:Star Trek – The Next Generation. This series was regarded by most as the apex ofStar Trek, as the more genuine incarnation of Roddenberry’s vision. It stayed on our screens for almost 8 years, and truly ignited the mainstream success of theStar Trekfranchise and its subsequent incarnation. Once again, we can pinpoint how the general political landscape of the world is represented in this fictional tale of aliens and discovery.Star TrekTNG stars a new crew of the enterprise, captained byJean Luc Picard.
The political setting of this series could not have been more different from its ’60s counterpart. The idealistic view on liberalism and the harsh rejection to any sort of authoritarianism of the Cold War had now shimmered, leaving room to a more nihilistic and realist take on politics. Now, what became most relevant was the adherence by the Enterprise’s crew and the Federation as a whole to the Prime Directive. That is, the most fundamental rule of the Federation, dedicatednot to interfere to with the natural evolution of alien societies and not to intervene to alter the course of the inter-galactical balance. Therefore, in this iteration of the series, the Federation resembles much more the actual United Nations: a global institution devoted to maintaining international balance and be a mediator of conflict, rather than a carrier for Wilsonian ideals around the world.
In this environment we can frame the character ofPicard. WhilstKirkwas a brash and charismatic leader, he is a diplomat. WhereasKirkwould jump headstrong to defend the values of the Federation,Picardis a more collected, calculated and methodical captain. Many episodes of TNG usually revolved around issues of ethics or politics, with the Enterprise debating how they should tackle certain issues and coming up with a realistic and practical solution. This is wherePicardshined: with his Solomon-like ability to debate and his very strong sense of ethics, he was usually the person to guide the crew when the moral conundrum seemed insurmountable.Picardis a leader of men yes, but most of all he is anidealised politician, a man capable of uniting the rules and values with charisma and with a deep respect for others lives and safety. Of course, exploration and action where still major parts of the show, as this is StarTrek.
However,what TNG pushed was framing the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of the Federation in the nuts and bolts of politics: it showed what the issues of extreme idealism was and how politics works as a medium.
This idea of politics can be very much traced to the arguments ofFrancis Fukuyama.After humanity had vanquished all of its shortcoming and had managed to spread the ideals of peace and equality around the galaxy, it was really the “End of History”. In the real world, that related to the idea that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was going to be a hegemony of western liberal democracy, which was regarded as the peak of human politics. The show portrayed humanity as a whole moving towards a unified civilisation of universal principles, and they were able to share them non-violently with other species. Whereas in TOS the major antagonist of the Federation was usually theKlingon empire(a totalitarian society), it is telling that in TNGO the major antagonists are theBorg– a specie of androids whose goal is to absorb entire planets in their collective therefore cancelling their singularity – who pose a major threat to the ideals of freedom and self determination of the Federation.
Then, we come to the modern iteration ofStar Treks.Virtuallynone of the values and core concepts of the original series apply. Instead, it has now become an explosion in space. It is important to state that with modern audiences, the “old”Star Trekwould not have the same appeal. Nowadays, with the humongous leaps in technology and CGI, and the general trend of people demanding more action packed and fast content,having hours on hours of people debating about ethics of alien races would not generate enough revenue to stay on air.
That is why, the trilogy ofJJ Abramswhich started in 2009 does not really explore politics or Prime directive:it depicts the Trek universe in a shallow and action packed movie that does not want to make its audience think, it just wants to wow them with special effects. This is even more tragic when we analyse the modern TV series:Star Trek: DiscoveryandStar Trek: Picard.The two shows were supposed to be a modern reprise of the true television formula. Indeed, by not having the time shackles of a limited full movie, they had the chance to let their story breathe, tackle relevant issues and themes, and explore both the new characters we were presented and the new plot lines. Yet, none of this happens and these two shows are, once again, just explosions in space, a hollow version of the political and social relevanceStar Trekonce had.
Speaking of which, what is even more controversial are the seldom moments in which bothDiscoveryandPicardtry to tackle social themes. On the surface, they try to tackle the more commonly seen modern issues of discrimination, racial hatred, feminism and so on. Of course, it is an extremely important thing to do, especially to show to a mainstream audience how relevant these issues are, however, it is completely misplaced within the fictional universe ofStar Trek.
As stated before, inRoddenberry’soriginal vision of the show, humanity of the 24thCentury had already overcome these issues, and evolved into a more elevated society deprived of these problems. In the older series, having a transgender official or a woman as a captain was never an issue. It was normal, because in the fictional world ofStar Trek, that was no longer perceived as taboo. There was no need to emphasise issues of race or sexuality, because there weren’t any: humanity had managed to overcome its problem and finally accept all. Instead, in the new series you have “real” world problems flashed on screen for pure dramatic purposes and so that online blogs can champion how progressive and daring a TV show about alien exploration is.
To conclude, yes: it is true that newStar Trekhas to appeal to a difference type of audience that demands action and excitement, however, behind the decline of the show,we can recognise how our society has become more disillusioned about politics and ethics in general. Nowadays, the idealism of older generations has almost completely shimmered, and our faith in institutions such as the UN has slowly and steadily reduced.The fall from grace of the fictional representation ofStar Trekin some ways represents our modern disillusionment of the power of politics and of the relevance of qualities such as debate, ethics and the ability of going beyond the limits of our modern society.

How GAFA Are Undermining Our Democracy,"In the U.S about 65% of likely voters believe Big Tech such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, to cite some, detain a power so extensive they could harm the country’s economy, asurveyshows. And this fear has solid grounds:Facebook has 2.4 billion active monthly users,Amazon accounts for nearly 40% of all e-commerce spendingin America,Google gets more than 92% of global search engine inquiries. Since the start of the pandemic, big tech only experienced a relatively insignificant low-point at the stock market, when Wall Street actors were worried about the crisis, and rose up to reach evenhigher profitsthan before the emergency with a 43% bounce. As an example of this trend, Apple stock value reached $2 trillion in August. Their power has become so big, some experts have started tocompare them to government.
Butwhy are they so strong?A combination of factors seems to be the answer.
First of all, in our daily routine it is impossible not to deal with them: from reading the news, to look up for something on the internet, share pictures and messages, we couldn’t even imagine our lives without them. And they played an essential role during this time of quarantine, by helping us connecting with our loved ones, to buy goods, to use services, to watch a movie. But this is not all: when we think about tech giants we picture Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, and often we are not aware of the fact that many other platforms or services we use belong to one of these mega tech companies, named together by the acronym”GAFA”(Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon): Google owns Youtube and plans toacquire FitBit, Facebook owns WhatsApp and Instagram and so on.
This brings to the first issue -which is also one of the reason why GAFA are so powerful:market concentration. In the U.S, a lawsuit against Google’s search dominance is soon to be launched. In July, big tech’s CEOs testified in front of the Congress in ahearingcalled ”Online Platforms and Market Power: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google’‘, focusing on the anti-competitive behavior of their firms, in the framework of an investigation started over a year ago. Antitrust authorities,both in the US and in the EU, are more and more concerned over the role of these companies in our democracies.
Another difficult point isdata: GAFA store and process a giant amount of information on consumers’ behavior and personal data, companies and producers, hence having a strategic advantage not only on users but also on producers whilst they act as intermediaries. The transaction of ”data” as opposed to the transaction of ”money” is more challenging to identify in the harm it causes and hence to regulate, especially because the big tech companies owning this striking amount of information are the same who run the algorithms on which the transactions are based.
Regardless of any Antitrust considerations, what seems to be at stake is also thedigital environmentand its users. Aresearchshowed that 41% of first Google’s search results are other Google’s services, with huge consequences on smaller websites’ businesses which saw a drastic drop in their revenues. In the same way, Facebook (but it is not the only one, see Google for instance), born as a small social network to reach recently more than 2 billion active users monthly, is underpinning themedia industry: media outlets have reached out to the platform to share their contents mainly because of the wide audience it provides. But algorithms work in a way that only certain news are showed and to pre-identified users, with the first significant consequence of diminishing media pluralism online, undermining one of the pillars of any democratic system. More and more media outlets are seeing huge losses in revenues directly dependent on Facebook’s news feed algorithm.
Finally, there is adisparity in the profits Facebook and publishers gain from the content shared, where of course publishers are those who are actually losing money, being unable to ask for better terms given their lack of market power. And this is true not only for small media outlets, but also for the biggest ones likeBuzzFeed, which can no longer afford to invest in the platform given the disparity of treatment in showing the news on the feed.
There is another way – probably even more insidious – in which platforms are considered beingundermining democracy.
After theCambridge Analyticascandal, which saw millions of users’ data being harvested without consent and profiled to push Trump’s win in 2016 through an app available on Facebook, not much has been done to control platforms’ interference in democratic processes such as elections. Facebook claims it has learned its lesson since 2016, and it has since then put into practice actions to prevent a similar outcome in the upcomingelections. Advertising transparency (including political advertising), verification and labelling of political ads in the US, disabling fake accounts and tackling disinformation are some of the policy developments Facebook has put into place to clean its reputation and gain trust from stakeholders and citizens.
In 2019, the platforms started limiting the visibility of some content on the news feed when it ”undermines the authenticity of the platform”. Ahead of the 2020 US presidential elections, Facebook shared apostover new measures such as Facebook Protect, to preserve the accounts of candidates and their teams, showing confirmed page owners and enhancing fact-checking. But is it working? During UK elections in 2019, the platform refused to remove manipulated videos by the Conservative party, claiming that a private company has no right to censor politicians, therefore that very content is not subject to fact-checking by Facebook external partners.
In the same year, Facebook’s ex-head of global elections integrity operationsYal Eisenstat declaredthat
”it’s clear thatthe company won’t make the necessary fixes without being forced to, either by advertisers who refuse to spend money on their platforms until Facebook cleans up the spread of misinformation and other harmful content; employees who continue to demand accountability and responsibility from their leaders; and most immediately, government action”.
Recently,  a boycott campaign named ”StopHateForProfit” has been launched to hold social media platforms accountable for the content they spread, especially concerning onlinehate speech. Facebook has been particularly hit by this initiative, to which more than 1200 large companies (amongst them: Coca Cola and Unilever) adhered, refusing to run advertising campaigns on the platform.
When talking about the platforms’ role in influencing elections and democratic processes in general, we must distinguish betweenmicro-targeted political advertising and disinformation campaigns. Micro-targeting uses the data regarding a certain individual, collected by the platform, to show him or her specific ads based on his/her profile. Hence, in the case ofpolitical advertising, it can be used to influence users’ opinions through specific campaigns which often contain false or misleading information. On Facebook, micro-targeting is set by using different types of data, e.g. incomes, geographical area, level of education etc. Political micro-targeting is not an issue occurring only on Facebook, all major platforms are concerned, and despite their tentatives to self-regulate and control the phenomenon, the results are still fable and precarious, so much that governments started to step up to ensure the protection of the delicate mechanisms that is democracy.
Strictly connected to micro-targeting and political ads on platforms, we finddisinformation spreading. It is the voluntary spread of misleading or false information with the purpose of manipulating and harming a person, a group of individuals or even a country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how dangerous it can be to share false information, especially when it comes to citizens’ health: these information can reach billions of people in a short period of time. The complexity of targeted disinformation campaigns is made even more insidious by the fact that the actors behind are in the majority of cases other countries: the most famous examples are the disinformation campaigns conducted by Russia, which has targeted both the US and the EU, using trolls, closed Facebook groups, targeted advertising and fake accounts.
Finally, it is important to consider the vast amount of resources allowing GAFA to realize extremely effectivelobbying campaigns, especially in the EU. Between 2013 and 2018, GAFA increased their expenditure onlobbyingin the EU of the 444%, meaning they went from 2.8 millions euro in 2013 to 15.25 millions euro in 2018. They regularly hire lobbyists from European institutions, gaining an important advantage over the EU and its pushes for stricter regulation and policies. By using this influencing power, combined with their economic dominance, they tipped the balance between governments and corporations in favor of the latter, buying themselves a position in which are the governments those who need to bargain.
Policy makers are understanding that the problem is not whether GAFA are lawful or not, but the fact that they represent a new type of public utilities which, therefore, need to be regulated to safeguard the public interest. The EU is currently working on the Digital Services Act package and a Democracy Action Plan, both expected to be presented by the Commission by end of this year, which will address issues such as platforms’ regulation, illegal activities online, transparency and legal obligations for platforms as well as a new competition tool and tackling disinformation. What is clear is that platforms need to be regulated and thatself-regulation is not enough: what is at stake is our democracy, and given the continuous growth of these actors it is logical to assume that this topic will be on top of the policy agenda in the EU and across the entire globe for many years onwards.

The Effects of Water Scarcity: Evidence From Afghanistan,"The nexus betweenclimate changeand humansecurityin Afghanistan remains severely understudied. This article aims to discuss the effects ofclimate changeandwater scarcity on violenceat the communal level in the country, where the rise of tensions and violent disputes among different local communities are often induced by the competition over scarce natural resources, such as water. To further the knowledge of this topic and answer to the main research question –Does climate change and the resulting water scarcity fuel instability inAfghanistan?– several interviews with experts in both water security and Afghanistan have been conducted.
What is known about climate change suggests that in the future,it will be uncontrollable and widespread, raising concerns for human security. Despite its vulnerability to both climate change and conflicts, little attention has been paidto Afghanistan.
Unfortunately, climate change is not only a future possibility in the country, butit is already happening at a fast rate. According to recent studies, since 1950, the climate has experienced significant changes: for instance, temperatures have risen by around 1.8 °C with more pronounced warming in the South, followed by the Central Highlands and the North. Scientists have also found that since 1960, mean rainfall in Afghanistan has decreased by2% per decade, limiting the availability of vital water resources.
The2011 Afghanistan Human Development Reportwarns that by 2025 the country’s water availability per capita per year will decline by approximately 36% relative to 2004. By 2040,it will fall by almost 50%. NEPA, UNEP, and WFP report that Afghanistan is also extremely exposed to climate hazards, especially droughts caused by either declining rainfall or river ﬂows, resulting from reduced spring-time snowmelt in the highlands. It is not surprising that Afghanistan is26th on the 2019 Climate Risk Index list of most vulnerable countries to extreme weather events. Interestingly, even the interview participants have noticed changes in the climatic patterns of Afghanistan and confirm that many critical issues in the country actually derive from water, which is often considered a hidden security problem.
Secondly,climate change is not the only factor reducing water in the country. As a matter of fact, years of conflict, water mismanagement by the state, neglect of infrastructures, and lack of skilled personnel have played an equally important role in the scarcity of water resources. Such constraints have been largely cited in the interviews, which underline the serious lack of irrigation networks, water storage capacities, and of an adequate water management system in the country. However, the words of one of the participants invites us to reflect:
“Climate change and the lack of infrastructures are both important issues, but they have a different speed.Climate change is faster, and it cannot be controlled”.
The consequencesof water scarcity in Afghanistan can be multiple. Unsurprisingly, the agricultural sector is severely affected alongsidefood security.  Moreover, as agriculture is the main economic activity of the country, water scarcity also has an influence onincome generation,employment opportunities, andrural poverty. Interviewees argue that due to the scarcity of water, several provinces in the country can farm no longer. They report that sometimes water is abundant, but not in the right period for irrigation. Naturally, this has negative impacts on the agricultural sector, which is experiencing significant constraints.
NEPA, UNEP, and WFP suggest that today, usually arable land usually is sometimes left uncultivated due to a lack of water, seriously affecting farmers’ livelihoods. FAO informs us that despite its importance for the sustenance of the country, productivity in the agricultural sector remains relatively low and a third of the population is food insecure with 36% of the population living with low dietary diversity.
On this basis, climate change and water scarcity were found toincrease competition among local communities,exacerbating social tensions and amplifying violence in the country. Evidence from both interviews and NGOs’ reports, such as the Cooperation for Peace and Unity, suggested that water disputes at the communal and family levels are a widespread phenomenon, characterised by low-intensity violence, with high escalating potential.
The different experts from international research centres and think tanks that were interviewed for this study confirm thatcompetition over water is increasing, leading to additional tensions, fights, and killings. Frictions between families, upstream and downstream communities, farmers, and nomads are often mentioned. Additionally, it has been found that ethnic elements are often present, aggravating the already tense situation. Therefore, it is clear that climate change has the potential to trigger violence in Afghanistan. UNEP suggests that Afghan people are more affected by these kinds of violence as opposed to war at the national level.
Finally, participants were asked whether climate change and the resulting water scarcity might fuel instability in Afghanistan. All interviewees answered positively to this question, confirming their perception of climate change as a threat multiplier in the country.
Therefore, from the data gathered through the interviews and the analysis of previous studies, it is tempting to conclude that climate change has a significant role in Afghanistan. It is not the main nor the sole cause of problems as the insurgency still is a serious burden, but it certainly affects Afghan people’s everyday lives, contributing to the fragility of the country.

[Analysis] Regularising Undocumented Migrants in the European Union: The Added COVID-19 Factor,"COVID-19 has opened a window of opportunity for revising models of migration governance in the EU Member States and reviving talks on the regularisation of undocumented foreigners – once a taboo topic. Scrolling down the lists of questions in the European Commission’spublic consultationon legal migration, respondents are asked whether “the EU should support and coordinate Member States’ national approaches in developing balanced regularisation measures”. Butwhat is regularisation?What are its advantages and disadvantages? And why has COVID-19 spiced up the political debate on regularisation?
In an extensive study commissioned by the European Commission in 2009, the authors define regularisation as “any state procedure by which third country nationals who areillegally residing, or who are otherwisein breach of national immigration rules, in their current country of residence are granted a legal status” (Baldwin-Edwards & Kraler, 2009:9). In short, regularisation – also termed amnesty, legalisation, or normalisation – is a policy tool that provides those who reside irregularly in a country with a pathway to temporary or permanent legal status. The reader interested in a detailed analysis of all the complex forms that regularisation can take is invited to consult the abovementioned study.
For now, it suffices to say that states have often considered regularisation as part of a somewhat utopian arsenal of measures designed to control irregular migration.
Debates on the regularisation of undocumented foreign nationals are nothing new. According to a study by the ICMPD (2012), EU Member States have launched around70 regularisation programmes with over 6 million applicantssince the 1980s. The two major arguments underlying these measures are anchored in a rights-based and an economic rationale.
From a rights-based perspective, regularisation offers the possibility to include undocumented individuals into society and formal labour market structures and thereby safeguard their fundamental rights. This argument is mainly advanced by rights groups, which often pressure governments to launch regularisation programmes as a remedy to exploitative living and working conditions. In countries such as Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain, for instance, civil society organisations successfully lobbied governments for regularisation on several occasions in the past (Baldwin-Edwards & Kraler, 2009:83). A recent study (Kraler, 2018) shows that regularised migrants view access to social rights, work, and welfare entitlements as the greatest benefits of regularisation.
These rights-based considerations often come in combination with an economic logic centred on regulating the labour market. In this latter case, governments resort to regularisation in order to combat irregular employment and increase social security and tax revenues. In the past,the need to control the significant number of people working in the informal economy pushed countries that rely on foreign work to reluctantly launch unpopular regularisation programmes. A case in point is the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) in the USA, which legalised the status of around 2.7 million migrants between 1986 and 1999 (Castles et al., 2014:218). The same occurred in manyEuropean countries, including Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France (Levinson, 2005).
Against these arguments, detractors of regularisation question its effectiveness (see Greenway et al., 2006). One objection is that regularisation does not have an unambiguously positive effect on the labour market. In slight support of this criticism, studies give a mixed picture of the relationship between regularisation and employment trends, wages, and occupational mobility (ICMPD, 2012; Kossoudji, 2016).
However, the most frequent objection – and the one that usually polarises public debate – is thatregularisation has a pull effect, encouraging more people to cross borders irregularly in the hope of legalising their status one day. Although this argument is reasonable, we lack enough data to clearly confirm or disconfirm it (see Finotelli & Arango, 2011). In the EU, where people can move freely across internal borders, an additional, related problem is that an increase in the stocks and flows of irregular migrants in one country is likely to translate into a similar increase in neighbouring countries.
All these concerns surfaced in 2008, when the French Council Presidency suggested banning mass regularisations altogether (Brick, 2011). However, at the insistence of countries that struggled to control their undocumented population, this proposal was eventually attenuated in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, where EU Member States agreed to resort only to case-by-case, as opposed to general, regularisation (a promise soon broken). While the practice of large-scale regularisation programmes gradually fell into disuse over the past decade, COVID-19 has added a bit of spice to the debate.
The health crisis has changed the balance between supporters and opponents of regularisation in favour of the former for at least four reasons:
Such changes are most visible in the political debate in Portugal, Italy, and Spain, the three countries that implemented some, albeit limited, regularisation measures during lockdowns (see Statewatch, 2020). In March this year,Portugalwas the first to grant foreigners with pending asylum applications the same right as permanent residents to access social services until 30 June.Italyfollowed suit in May, when it granted temporary residence permits to undocumented migrants working mainly in agriculture and domestic work. In parallel, Spain passed legislation allowing specific segments of its migrant population to renew or apply for the first time for residence and work permits. Most notably, Spain also emptied its overcrowded and precarious detention centres.These measures may seem surprising given governments’ attempts to toughen migration laws in Italy and Spain in the past years. However, we can understand their adoption against the background of the four points listed above.Any policy that could improve the condition of undocumented migrants in Italy was taboo in pre-COVID-19 times, when public attention focused almost exclusively on reducing sea arrivals.
As the pandemic reduced irregular entries and caused labour shortages, discussions on how to tackle Italy’s long-standing problems with undeclared work, and particularly with the caporalato phenomenon (the irregular recruitment of mostly migrant workers in agriculture), resumed. Regularisation was first proposed by Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova, a prominent figure in the fight against the caporalato. Left and centre-left parties endorsed her proposal for a combination of rights-based and economic reasons, whereas the anti-establishment Five Star Movement gave in more reluctantly (Pettrachin, 2020).
The political scene was not too differentin Spain, where the measures taken in support of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers during the pandemic have been touted as a success for civil society organisations (PICUM, 2020). Rights groups found fertile ground among the left-wing fringes of the ruling coalition and pressured the PSOE to address the deteriorating situation of irregular migrants (Dìez, 2020).
The ad hoc regularisation measures adopted during the pandemic in Portugal, Spain, and Italy were far from perfect. They targeted a small portion of the migrant population and only for a limited period. In Italy, for instance, a major problem was that migrants could not apply for residence and work permits on their own initiative, but rather they had to wait for their employers to initiate the process and pay a lump sum of 500 euros per application.
As the diagram below indicates, these measures eventually led to the regularisation of a relatively small number of people. The fact that domestic work is the sector where most migrants (176,848 out of around 200,000) have been regularised suggests that Italy failed to improve working and living conditions in one of its most exploitative and yet profitable sectors, agriculture.
As EU Member States flounder in the pandemic economy, thepolicymaking community argues for a move towards a new model of migration governance that combines rights-based and economic objectives in the long term(Fanjul & Dempster, 2020).
Pooling expertise and resources at EU level to support and coordinate Member States in developing balanced regularisation measures at the national level might be a step in the right direction. Time will tell whether a proposal for an EU-wide approach to regularisation will make it on the Commission’s agenda and through subsequent negotiations.

Beyond the Battlefront of the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Conversation with Ulviyya Fataliyeva,"Ulviyya Fataliyyeva, a talented 24-year-old chess player, heard Armenian missiles fall 1km from her house in Ganja, Azerbaijan. TNGO ContributorDaniela Movileanuinterviews her to uncover theHuman Storybehind the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.*
*The interview was recorded on Oct. 8, 2020.
On what seems to be a normal Sunday morning, Ulviyya is lying on the sofa in the quiet of her Ganja house. But at 10:43 AM the unexpected happens: the house shudders like in an earthquake and a deafening sound abruptly ends the quiet. “What’s going on?” she asks in her mind, rushing into the corridor. There, she hears her mom saying in an emotional voice, “Ganja is under fire”. Her mom has just seen with her own eyes two missiles streak into the city. The news sends Ulviyya’s mind reeling, unable to understand or process the information.
Her city, Ganja, the second largest city of Azerbaijan, is 60km far from the conflict zone in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous territory controlled by ethnic Armenians but internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. She knows that her grandmother’s city, Tovuz, close to the Armenian border, has been under attack since 12 July despite being outside the conflict zone. But why is her city, Ganja, being dragged into the conflict, too? She did a quick Google search but found no information.
She tells herself to stay calm. She recalls all the times she was on the point of losing everything in a game of chess but managed to control her emotions and avoid the worst. This ability helped her to become twice European Youth Champion, member of her National Team, Woman Grandmaster – one of the highest titles in chess – and much more. But no more than thirty minutes after the first attack, a second blast forces her to face the fact that her chess skills are of little use now. Under shock, she barely hears her mom urging her to go to the basement immediately. She knows it is the right thing to do, but she feels paralysed, her thoughts swirling in her mind.
Since that morning on 4 October,Ulviyya’s city has been constantly shelled.
The first attacks hit the university, no more than 1km far from her home and near her father’s workplace. One person died, more than thirty were injured. The following day, new attacks at 10AM. Then at 2:43AM and again at 2AM. Azerbaijanclaimsthat the missiles were launched from Armenian territory in order to provoke the country and trigger the pact of mutual assistance with Russia, but Armenia denies this charge.
For his part, Vagarshak Harutyunyan, chief advisor to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, confirmed his government’s intention to target civilian areas in Azerbaijan in aninterviewfor a popular Russian channel. What is sure is that Ulviyya, like many others trapped in this conflict, has barely slept since that Sunday morning, knowing that a missile could sweep away her own home at any time. As she put it, these days in Ganja you “cannot do anything, you are just waiting. In one second, in a minute, or in an hour, everything can be destroyed”.
You cannot do anything, you are just waiting. In one second, in a minute, or in an hour, everything can be destroyed.
Despite the Russian-brokeredhumanitarian ceasefireof 10 October, Armenian weapons continue to wreak havoc in several Azerbaijani cities, including Ganja, Mingachevir, Tartar, and Barda. The attacks of Sunday, 11 October, on Ganjakilled 10 civilians, injured 34, and destroyed over 100 civilian facilities, according to local statistics referred to us by Ulviyya. Based onofficial reports, at least 250 Armenians and Azerbaijanis have died since the conflict started escalating in late September, with both sides accusing each other of targeting civilians.
In this conversation with Ulviyya, TNGO writerDaniela Movileanutries to understand the experience of young Azerbaijanis like her in this long-standing conflict. The violent clashes of the 1990s, which ended with a ceasefire in 1994, are still fresh in the memories of Ulviyya’s parents and their generation. Their most painful memory is theKhojaly massacreof 26 February 1992, when Armenian forces killed as many as 613 ethic Azerbaijani civilians in the town of Khojaly in what is known as the worst atrocity in the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (see for instance the film documentaryEndless Corridor).
Butwhat about Ulviyya’s generation? What do Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey mean to young Azerbaijanis today?
TNGO is extremely grateful to Ulviyya for sharing her experience and opinions with us in a long video call despite the lack of internet connection in Azerbaijan these days. The excitement in her voice as she describes her quiet life before the conflict –  how she obtained her master’s degree in Anglo-American Studies from La Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, how she started playing the piano and spending more time with her family during the pandemic period – and then the constant fear caused by the attacks attests to her desire to let the world know what is happening in her city.
Watch the full conversation with Ulviyya to learn more about her powerful story.

[Analysis] Oil Security in Northeast Asia: Sino-Russian Drillers vs ExxonMobil,"Northeast Asia is aresource-rich regionthat has become of increasing importance in recent years due to the oil crisis affecting the Middle East. Because it is renowned that oil and natural gas are running out worldwide,Russia,China,Japan, and the two Koreas have been seeking to becomeregionally dependenton the sources of petroleum in Siberia and, in particular, on Russia’s Sakhalin Island. In fact,oil companies from Northeast Asia have become oil-drilling leadersin the region and in the world. What does this imply for oil security in Northeast Asia? And how are these countries coping with sustainability and oil consumption?
As previewed by the title of this analytical report,Sino-Russian drillers have become leaders in the oil sector. To the left, a column chart showing the capital expenditure of key companies on planned and announced projects across the oil and gas value chain between 2018 and 2025 showsRussia’s Gazprom and China’s Sinopec(China Petrochemical Corporation) as the leader developers for present and future projects. European and American firms like Shell and ExxonMobil, once the undisputed leaders in this sector, rank now 3rd and 4th according to GlobalData’s Oil & Gas Intelligence Centre. Another important contribution of these values is that, in the same chart, one can find two Russian leaders, Gazprom and Rosneft Oil, as well as two Chinese leaders, Sinopec and CNPC (China National Petroleum Corporation), which is aclear sign of the increasing importance of these countries in the oil and petroleum extraction and distributionacross the globe.
According to theRussian Oil and Technology Magazine,Gazprom and Sinopec are expected to become top spenders across the oil and gas value chain with capital expenditure (Capex) totaling up to US$ 259.1 billion by 2025. This source confirmed that, already in 2018, Gazprom led with “an estimated capex of US$170.2bn expected to be spent on 93 oil and gas projects globally. Sinopec and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (Shell) follow with capex of US$88.9bn (69 projects) and US$84.5bn (107 projects), respectively”. The Russian oil and gas agenda has so far been stressing on the building of pipelines, projects, and processing plants, therefore it is focusing on creating the needed infrastructure to facilitate the uninterrupted supply of gas in multiple markets. As expressed in the Asia Times, “Russia has the opportunity to create Canada out of Siberia,” and in recent years has indeed involved multiple international companies on Russian soil to contribute to projects. In particular, China is an appreciated guest due to the potential help it may give to infrastructure projects, as demonstrated in other whole-Chinese initiatives like the BRI.
ThePower of Siberia pipeline inaugurated by Russia and China in December 2019may be one of the most successful projects to have so far seen Russia and China cooperating in mutually benefiting initiatives. ThePower of Siberiais a 3000 kilometers-long pipeline that connects Lake Baikal in Siberia to the Chinese cities of Harbin, Jilin, and Liaoning, and has the potential to be extended to Shanghai as a multibillion-dollar project. According to the Chinese approach, economic deals such as the Power of Siberia pipeline arekey components of diplomacyand are what drives good relations with countries like Russia. This is a very different, pragmatic, and rapid approach compared to the approach preferred in Europe, where countries tend to prioritize communication, and multilateral conversations often end up in the delaying of important projects such as that of theNord Stream 2 pipeline, involving Russia and EU.
Politics and the structure of the government certainly do affect decision-making. In China, while most companies are state-owned, this does not necessarily obstacle progress. In fact,China has now five of the world’s largest crude oil companies. Other than Sinopec (China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation), one could easily list the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum, and the Sinochem Group.The supply potential both Russia and China have in Northeast Asia could not only satisfy the consumption demands of this region but possibly address those of a greater East Asia.
Considering that Northeast Asia is made ofRussia, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and China, then it is easy to understand the reasons why addressing consumption is a key concern for these countries’ leaders. Firstly,population growthis a common concern due to the over 2 billion people inhabiting these countries. Population is not only a concern for the present, but it is also a factor shaping energy security for the future. Other reasons are certainly thedistribution of the populationand theclimate. In fact, this may not only affect the import and export of oil but also the construction of advanced technology and infrastructure to allow the distribution of resources. This, however, is not only the only type of climate one has to worry about because thegeopolitical climateis also a very important feature for the successes of projects that may address public consumption in Northeast Asia. For instance, including both North Korea and South Korea in the same project may be a double-edged sword as it can certainly have positive effects on the relations between these two countries, but it can also enhance conflict and thereforedisrupt stability in the region.
This is whyoil securityis extremely important when it comes to discussing oil diplomacy between very diverse countries.  As written by expertSe Hyun Ahn in the article “Energy Security in Northeast Asia: Putin, Progress and Problems”:
“Energy security is defined as the securing of reliable and affordable energy supplies that are sufficient to support social, economic, and military needs, while at the same time being environmentally sustainable.”
The main issue identified in the region is that countries like China are extremelyhungry for all kinds of energy sourcesand these demands will only keep growing steadily, as shown in apresentation on Oil Security and Collaboration in Northeast Asia, created by the Head of the Non-Member Countries Division Asia/Pacific and Latin American countries of the International Energy Agency, Norio Ehara,the gap between oil demand and production in China will continue to riseand will become a very tough issue to resolve in 2030. In this year,Northeast Asia is also expected to consume over 20% of the world’s available oil, through dependency on mostly Siberian projects rather than Middle Eastern.
This is why it will be increasingly important for North East Asian countries toimprove policies, bureaucracy, sustainable development, and work on renewable energy.
As the former leader in the oil and gas sector, US’s companyExxonMobilhas, since the early 2000s, seen great potential in Far East Russia. As shown in the map at the very start of this article, the region of the Bering Strait, dividing Alaska from the Far East Russialeaves space for important cooperationbetween the US and Russia. In fact,ExxonMobil has taken part in significant projects like Sakhalin-1, one of the largest offshore investment projects in Russia. Theproject operator of Sakhalin-1 is Exxon Neftegas Limited, subsidiary of ExxonMobil, which holds 30% of the ownership, more than its Russian counterpart Rosneft (20% of the share), Japanese SODECO (also 30%), the Indian state-owned ONGC Videsh (20%).
But, despite the strength and value of Sakhalin-1, as shown in the table to the right,Gazprom has later largely taken over projects in the Russian Far East, replacing ExxonMobil as the world’s top energy conglomerate in 2017. In subsequent projects such asSakhalin-2andSakhalin-3, indeed, sought the advent of East Asian companies like Japanese Mitsui and Mitsubishi, and Chinese Sinopec, rather than the continuation of ExxonMobil as major driver to these energy initiatives. Additionally,the rise of Sinopec has increasingly shaped ExxonMobil’s policyof working with East Asian state-owned companies despite eventualdifferences in the institutional and bureaucratic structures, but its dominance in the region has decreased to the point that, in 2005,ExxonMobil sold its 3.7% stake in Sinopec in 2005and continued to decrease until 2020, whenExxon cut costs at Russia’s Sakhalin-1project due to the impact of COVID-19 on the job market.
Theeconomic sanctionsimposed on Russia by the US in recent years may also be a determinant for the lack of US presence and the rise of Chinese oil and gas companies in Northeast Asia. TheRace for the Arctic, however, may interestingly revolutionize these roles, as the US has interests in maintaining a dominant position along with Canada and Nordic countries in Europe.
The main conclusion to this analysis is that projectingoil security development and sustainability in the future is difficult mainly due to the durability of this resourceand the limited methods used to consume it. According to the International Energy Agency and theGlobal Energy Institute, however,economic interdependencemay be a key feature to ensure cooperation among states on energy security.
The issue that remains is that countries likeChina are among the world’s top consumers, thereforeit will be increasingly difficult to diversify the energy sources of these economies and deviate from the nuclear source. While Chinese metropoles have been increasingly prioritizing environmentally-friendly technologies and, for instance, transport has started turning electric, however, there is still much to do to address the huge demands for such a big population. On the other hand, while the role of Far East Russia is central to Northeast Asian oil security, Far East Russia, or Siberia, has an important need to develop both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of general economic growth because Siberia does not host a huge population, therefore, the economy runs differently from that of European  Russia.
While Sinopec and Gazprom, along with other Sino-Russian drillers, have been working extensively on growth and seem to have found a shared dimension and vision, in the future, it will be essential to do the same with Mongolian, Korean, and Japanese oil companies. As Ahn (2007) predicts:
“From the regional economic security perspective, Northeast Asian regional integration depends upon a certain degree of shared economic, political, and ideological interests before it can be successfully launched.”
The Arctic could expand the potential for cooperation between multilateral entities, however, this means Northeast Asia will have toset the agenda and prioritize climate-related problems, as it already finds itself suffering from on a smaller scale.Environmental degradation and climate change are pivotal to make projections on oil security policiesand decide the right path to follow both politically and economically to ensure the sustainable future of this region.

The New Domain (and Threat) of the Cyberattacks: Russia,"On September 29, 2020, for the first time, Microsoft published their annual report “Digital Defense Report”, which deals with cybersecurity tendencies of the previous year. This report has a cautious tone for the cyber future and warns of future dangers, in particularly fromRussiaagainst theUnited States.
In thereport, Microsoft examined the cyber trends of 2019 and declared “threat actors have rapidly increased in sophistication over the past year, using techniques that make them harder to spot and that threaten even the savviest targets”. In particular, Microsoft focused onnation-state actors, as they have become increasingly notable in the cyber world and have been played a more prominent role in the sphere. In the report, the organization believes that nation-states use cyber-attacks and have specific targets that match up with theirown political goals. Following the research, Microsoft listed the most prominent and influential hacker groups backed by governments in the map below.
According to the research of cyber activity between July 2019 and June 2020,Russiaparticularly stands out in the list of government-based hackers with52%, followed byIranwith 25%,Chinawith 12% and North Korea and other minor governments with 11%. Furthermore, the number one target country is theUnited Stateswith 69%, followed by theUnited Kingdomwith 19%,Canadawith 5%,South Koreawith 4%, and lastlySaudi Arabiawith 3%. In particular, Microsoft has examined specific activity groups of nation-state actors and has been analysed their impact in society. Below, the report shows the top six society sectors that have been targeted by nation-state actors, in this case especially byRussia.
Firstly, 32% if nation-state actors have been targetednon-governmental organisations, such as “advocacy groups, human rights organisations, non-profit organisations, and think tanks focused on public policy, international affairs and security”. In this sector, the Russian hacker groupSTRONTIUM, also known as Fancy Bear, have undertaken three quarters of hacker activity, especially against sporting organisations.
The second most targeted sector isprofessional servicesat 31%. In this section, the report detected that the Russian groupSTRONTIUMonce again “attempted to compromise consulting firms and government contractors, specifically U.S. defense contractors and large public affairs, corporate legal, IT, media, and physical security consultancies operating in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East”.
The third most targeted sector isgovernmental organisationswith 13%. Microsoft identified the Chinese hacker groupNICKELto have been the most aggressive hacking group here, launching attacks against several foreign ministries in eleven countries in Latin America and Europe. At second place in this category is the Russian group YTTRIUM, also known as Cozy Bear, which has infiltrated the diplomatic missions of multiple European countries.
Coming in fourth place for the society sector target lists areinternational organisationsat 10%. Here, the Iranian groupMERCURY, also known as Muddy Water, have become prominent in their activities against organisations working with refugees. The North Korean group THALLIUM, also named as Kimsuky, have attempted to infiltrate organisations working on regional developments in Africa. Lastly, the South Korean group DUBNIUM and the Iranian group PHOSPHORUS, also called Charming Kitten, have been involved in hacking global health organisations.
In the fifth place, Microsoft putinformation technology firmswith 7%. In this sector, the organisation detected the two most active groups. The first is the Chinese groupMANGANESE, also known as Keyhole Panda, which attempted to endanger IT companies based in the US. The second group is the Iranian groupMERCURY, which attacked network technology providers based in the Middle East.
The final sector to be targeted ishigher educationat 7%. In fact, Microsoft identified the groupsSTRONTIUM,PHOSPORUS,BARIUM(Chinese group under the name of Apt41),THALLIUM, andZINK(North Korean group under the name of Lazarus) as the most active in this area. These groups have hacked several universities around the world, as they “often house cutting-edge research initiatives that might be of interest to nation state actors”.
Overall, Microsoft have detected and identified various hacker groups predominantly from Russia, China, and Iran that have interfered in society and have become a more serious threat, despite Microsoft being incapable of identifying the specific objectives of the hacking activity of the nation-state actors.
In addition to this hacking information, Microsoft examined the role of these groups and their threat against major current events. As such, Microsoft have warned that groups backed mostly by Russia, as well also by China and Iran, are trying to intrude and interfere with people and groups that are linked to theUS presidential electionof 2020, from bothDonald Trump’s andJoe Biden’s campaigns. In particular, the Russian groupSTRONTIUMhas attacked around 200 political organisations, and the Chinese groupZIRCONIUMhas “attacked high-profile individuals associated with the election, including people associated with the Joe Biden for President Campaign and prominent leaders in the international affairs community.”
Lastly, the Iranian groupPHOSPHORUShas attempted to discover the identity of customers of Microsoft email accounts and has subsequently attacked 241 of them. These specific customers were linked to the US presidential campaign, officials of the US government, political reporters, as well as influential Iranian expats.
Although the new data is worrying,the Russian threat is not new. In fact, during the presidential campaign of 2016 between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Russian government allegedlyinterferedin the election. Russian hackers allegedly breached the campaign led by Hillary Clinton, as well as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and also the Democratic National Committee. Moreover, it appears that they tried to also publish fake political news on the internet, in order to damage the Clinton’s election hopes. This breach was investigated by the CIA, FBI, and the National Security Agency, whostatedthat “President Vladimir Putin ordered the effort […] with the dual aims of damaging Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and undermining the US democratic process”. Subsequently, the FBI havewarnedthat Russia are actively hindering the current US presidential election to malign Joe Biden.
Interestingly enough, the publishing of Microsoft’s report revealed thatRussia is the number one nation-state hacker against the US. This follows theannouncementof Russian President Vladimir Putin on September 25 and his willingness to collaborate with the US in the field of cyber security. In particular, President Putin would “agree on a comprehensive program of practical measures to reboot [the] relations in the field of security in the use of information and communication technologies”, as well as “to exchange […] guarantees of non-intervention into internal affairs of each other, including into electoral processes”.
Even though President Putin is aiming to establish a Russia-US cyber security collaboration, his announcement clearly clashes with Microsoft’s data, showing that Russia is the number one nation-state hacker and that most of Russia’s actions are aimed to breach US organisations. As such, given precedents and the new threats, Microsoftadvisesthat, “more federal funding is needed in the US so states can better protect their election infrastructure”, as well as “encourag[ing] state and local election authorities in the U.S. to harden their operations and prepare for potential attacks”. This has a significant warning tone, especially as the US presidential election have taken place on November 3rd.

Feminist Economics: A Deeper Look into Gender and Economics,"Over the years questions have arisen over the adequacy of economics today. This is largely due to the fact that economics has proved to be biased when it comes to gender, leading to a one-sided view of things and thus an inaccurate description and analysis of the interaction of society with economics.
Feminist economistJulie A. Nelsonargues that currently, economics is socially constructed based on gender, and the assumptions and stereotypes held about certain genders. She posits that economics is male-centric, in that it reflects societal beliefs about masculinity such as rigidity or ‘hardness’. Moreover, more often than not hard economics is preferred to soft economics because hardness is associated with strength and masculinity, and softness with femininity. Implicitly therefore,masculinity is generally viewed as being superior to femininity thus preferred in economics.
Another factor that betrays the gender bias of economics is that the methods, models, topics and pedagogy are often only in relation to male oriented activities. When it comes to pedagogy, for example, it is often the case that economics is taught in a way that reinforces the samegender biased valuesand, additionally, it is disproportionately seen as a discipline more suitably taught by men (and often even to men).
Nelson challenges these assumptions and proposes that perhaps if we changed our perspective, hardness is not necessarily a good thing as it may imply rigidity just as softness may imply desirable traits such as  flexibility and adaptability. It is therefore necessary that economics as a discipline is shifted, not into a female-centric subject but into one that isfree of gender biasso as to make it more accurate and ultimately more reliable (see alsoFinancial Control & Gender Equality – A Conversation with Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen).
The gender bias of economics is seen even more clearly when we narrow down our focus on to the specific fields of microeconomics and macroeconomics. A key microeconomics assumption is thatthe market will always dominate social relations, an idea which leads to wrong inferences about the real world. The idea of “Pareto Optimality” for example assumes that in every situation, my win is equal to your loss. However, this holdsinaccurateespecially in the case of intimate relationships between individuals or even in families where one person’s win will likely benefits other(s). Another equally inaccurate assumption is that individual preferences come from the market alone. This ignores the role of emotional motivations or relationships that may influence one’s preference; for example, it is not uncommon for one to purchase an item solely because of its sentimental value, for instance if a certain item reminds them of a loved one, or a cherished moment.
These assumptions thus reveal the biased perspective of economics when it comes to values. Economics tends to emphasize values such as individuality and independence, and promotes them as strong values. On the other hand, values such as emotional connection, sympathy and relationships tend to be ignored or to be presented as weak values despite their undeniable importance in assessing consumer behaviour and the market in general. Such bias leads to the presentation of only half the picture, and an unrealistic depiction of our society. Renowned feminist philosopher Martha C. Nussbaum supports this claim by emphasizing the importance of freedom of choice, individuality and the diversity of individuals in the market. These are proponents of flexibility and adaptability which are contrary to the traditionally rigid nature of economics.Microeconomics ignores the diversity of human nature by assuming that all individuals share a uniform trait of being inherently selfish, always prioritising self-satisfaction over the benefit of others. However, this is hugely inaccurate with a key example being mothers who often sacrifice the opportunity to earn money and advance their careers for their children and families, putting the needs of their families before their own, disproving the assumption of universal self-centeredness.
The example of the family unit also disproves another assumption made in microeconomics which is that competition always trumps cooperation. Although firms and producers in the market are often in competition, this is definitely not the case in relationships such as the family setting. Moreover, a constant state of competition among consumers suggests that all goods are scarce, which is a key assumption of microeconomics. This assumption can however be challenged when we shift our focus to the more intangible things of our world such as love and empathy which are key drivers of motivation and preference in society. These are definitely not scarce; their supply is infinite and thus competition would make no sense when it comes to these factors.
Another rigid assumption of microeconomics is thatvalues like efficiency will always be first in the list of prioritiescompared to values like creativity. Again, this shows the bias to promote rigid values over flexible ones. Although efficiency is often among the highly prioritized values, depending on the specific field, creativity may be of higher priority in fields such as writing, design, and many others.
When it comes to the field of macroeconomics, its relationship with gender highlights its equally biased nature.
To begin with, economics usually focuses on stereotypically male activities while assessing ‘work’. To measure the Gross Domestic Product,only those activities that are viewed as ‘contributing to the market’ are taken into consideration, and often the work done by women at home is excluded: for example, the exclusion of homecare and childcare shows bias in neglecting a historically female role, simply because the work is done in the home. Ironically, when these same activities: childcare, care of the aged and sick, are provided by the government, they are counted as contributing to the economy but not so when carried out at home. This in turn has a negative impact of undermining the work done by women and reinforces the stereotype that it is part of their inherent duties.
The economy can also be seen to favour men in thedistribution of resources. Disproportionately, property owners especially in parts of the developing world are men. In many African countries for instance, land ownership which is the main form of wealth, is seen as a man’s enterprise making it difficult for women to secure this form of financial stability. Moreover, in some societies some traditional cultural and religious laws exclude women and girls from land inheritance – such laws and societal norms take away from the ability of women to participate as full stakeholders in the economy.
Perhaps one of the biggest prevailing indicators of gender inequality in macroeconomics is the gender pay gap: women everywhere earn less than men. In the United States, women are said to earn seventy-nine cents for every dollar made by men. This gap is caused by a variety of factors, such as gender discrimination in the workplace, the motherhood penalty, and prevailing gender norms and socialization of women which assume that women are usually not the breadwinners and therefore should earn less than men. All these factors uncover the prevailing gender bias and its negative effects on women.
It is therefore evident beyond a shadow of a doubt that economics, as it is currently, is gender biased. It is thus time to lay “Homo Economicus” to rest and move towards a more gender inclusive and progressive economic paradigm.

Migration to Europe Faces a Continuous Threat from Slave Networks,"Since 2015, almosttwo million migrantshave arrived in Europe’s Mediterranean countries by land and sea.  This includes sub-Saharan African migration from countries like Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan. However, this is also the group most disproportionately affected by emergent slave networks along the routes to Europe. Thousands of these migrants’ journeys are derailed by criminal enterprises which force them into exploitation(Mafu, 2019).
Instead of reaching their desired destinations, migrants are subjected to a multiplicity of human rights abuses, the most extreme being slavery.Libya has become a notorious hub for slave tradingalong the course to Europe, however even countries within the continent have posed a danger to incoming migrants.Italy has also become home to criminal groups seeking out migrants to exploit.  There is therefore little contrast between European criminal enterprises and those in Libya when it comes to the mistreatment of migrants. The risks associated with each transit point between a source country and a destination country highlight the lack of security and therefore heightened vulnerability individuals experience as migrants.
Shocking news of the Libyan slave trade first received global outcry in late 2017. Asecretly filmed slave auction in Tripoliexposed the selling of sub-Saharan African migrants to anonymous buyers, who would use and exploit them for their own economic gains. Later discoveries indicated that migrants en route to Europe were being trapped in Libya, where they underwent severe dehumanizing treatment, including torture, sexual violence, and forced servitude. While male migrants tended to be sold into hard labour, female migrants were favoured for sex trafficking.
Libyabecame a crucial stop along the way for migrants moving from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe via the Central Mediterranean route. For many of them, however, their journey would end there, as smugglers promising to get them to Europe would instead sell them to Libyan criminal gangs. Smugglers conspiring with these gangs force migrants to pay the debts for their journeys by working as labourers for their ‘owners’. Volatile conditions fostered inLibya’s failed state, following the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi,meansthe country lacks the stable governance and organisationto mitigate and prevent such industries. Vulnerable migrants arriving in Libya are therefore prone to further violation. Where powerful organisations exist, they are often responsible for industries like the slave trade. From these criminal enterprises, many are militia opposition groups, associated with larger organisations like ISIS, who conspire with smugglers to capture migrants and reduce them to commodities.
While theUN-backedGovernment of National Accordis the internationally recognized governing body in Libya, the country’s continued position as a failed state means that it has little power to dismantle the slave networks. Althoughpeace plansbetween the western GNA and opposing Eastern Government have progressed within the last month, it is still uncertain whether these will ultimately succeed and lead to a government that can take control of the country’s illegal enterprises. Currently, the extent of the GNA’s ability to prevent abuse to migrants in Libya has been the initiation of rescue and repatriation operations, in cooperation with international bodies.
Following the 2017 discovery of the slave trade, international responses reflected the urgency posed by the crisis.European and African leaders coordinated repatriation effortsand launched plans to dismantle the slave trade, relocating migrants from Libya and, in many instances, returning them to their home countries. In 2018, theUnited Nations also began to sanction smugglersresponsible for aiding and operating the slave networks. TheGNA relies on this global assistance and outrage; partly due to its conviction that the international community bearssome responsibility for the illicit industry pervading Libya, but also partly because it lacks the manpower to do it on its own. This, however, indicates a bleak future for migrants passing through the country as such outrage is dying down, and with it, the initiatives aimed at rescuing rising numbers of migrants from captivity.
TheEuropean Unionhas since reinstated its hard-line approach to migration. TheUnion’s determination to limit migration from Africaespecially, spearheaded by countries like Greece, Hungary and Italy, has led to the transmission of greater power to authorities such asthe Libyan Coast Guard.  Responsible for detaining migrants in Libya and preventing them from reaching Europe, the Guard ultimately traps migrants in the volatile conditions that endanger their human rights further. Until they are returned to their source countries, migrants continue to be prone to exploitation in a lawless state. Once returned to their source countries,they are brought back to the socioeconomic conditions that drove them to leave in the first place.
Migrants who succeed in passing through the Mediterranean are still at risk of enslavement on European ground.Southern Italy has become notorious for its criminal gangs and their exploitation of migrants, particularly those arriving from Africa and the Middle East. Migrants are put to work on farms across the region, harvesting produce for very low wages and being subjected to poor working and living conditions. As in Libya,female migrants arriving in southern Italy are in danger of being sold into sex trafficking, with some forced into prostitution further across the continent. Violent and sexual abuse often accompanies these varying situations; hence, while not directly manifested in the form of slave auctions, Italy presents a danger of yet another form of slavery that preys on vulnerable migrants.
In many instances, farm labour in southern Italy is organized throughcontracted middlemen. These contractors are principally part of Italian organized crime and allow farmers to retain greater revenue by taking on the responsibility of ‘hiring’ desperate migrants. Without formal residency, migrants do not receive any worker protections and only meagre pay, but often have no choice but to accept any immediate work offered to them.Many migrants arrive in Italy already in debt, often to the smugglers that got them there.  Desperate to pay off their debts, migrants are faced with almost no way out of this bondage as recurrent instances have shown employers withholding wages and/or deducting high percentages to cover living and travel expenses. Many migrants also have their documents withheld, further hindering the possibility of escaping this exploitation. This is yet another example of theheightened vulnerabilitythat makes migrants more susceptible to the exploitation of criminal organisations, who are easily able to bypass EU and national union labour standards.
Southern Italy’s farming practices have been openly acknowledged by Italian authorities, however the recognition has often failed to fully disband the enslavement of migrants in the country. Previous attempts to further outlaw these practices have been ignored by criminal gangs. Althoughproposalsto increase the crackdown on agricultural contractors and their employment of migrants have been established in 2016, they have made little progress. Even Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte recognized the weakness of the initiative and the need to intensify the efforts.  Most recently, the government has been engaging inefforts to regularise migrantsand grant them temporary residency in Italy as a result of the strain created by Covid-19 on Italy’s agricultural sector. Although this should lead to migrants being afforded greater worker protections, they are still expected to cater as the cheaper foreign labour that the country is currently in need of. Furthermore,recent reportssuggest that regularisation efforts have done little to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on migrant farm workers, as the pandemic has led to substantially poorer working conditions.
It is not just on the road to Europe where migrants and refugees fall victim to slavery. Following the outbreak of the Syrian conflict, manySyrian refugees in neighbouring Lebanon have also been forced into slave labour. This includes child labour and is accompanied by sexual exploitation and assault. The fact that migrants are always most likely to fall into patterns of exploitation and slavery highlights the upsurge in their vulnerability as soon as they leave their source countries. The influx of migrants into Europe in the past five years has demonstrated this, as irregular migration routes and the illicit industries fostered along them continue to endanger migrants and their prospects for finding a better life.
Increasing anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe, exhibited by the growth of far-right parties and movements across the continent, contributes to the neglect of migrants and the ease with which they can be exploited(Davis, Deole, 2017). However, push factors contributing to migrants’ decisions to leave their home countries should also be considered. These factors include lack of educational and employment opportunities, as well as citizen social wellbeing and environmental issues(Asongu, Kodila-Tedika, 2018).
Therefore, while European immigration policies need to be tailored to take greater consideration of the by-products of derailed migration, investments also need to be made in source countries, where citizens can gain the opportunities they currently feel without and seek elsewhere.

Is Somebody Going to Lose on Security Cooperation?,"Brexit negotiationsare still open, although slowed by thepandemic. The deadline for the transition period is however closer than it seems, as it is set for 31 December 2020. Trade, free market, and the relationships with theRepublic of Irelandhave been discussed without any material conclusion. But, it seems there is something that has been acknowledged lesser importance: the security guaranteed within theEuropean Unionthrough cooperation in various security areas.
No Deal equals no cooperation on security. The reason for this is that the EU, throughout the years, has built a pretty effective apparatus for information and competence sharing among Member States. The United Kingdom has always played a fundamental role in the system of security cooperation, but will not anymore, if there is no agreement on the matter.
The main areas in which security cooperation at EU level has always been crucial are:terrorism,cyber-securityanddata protection, andarrest warrants.
As for terrorism, many believe that cooperation in this area will not be touched by Brexit for two main reasons.First, it is supposed to be driven also, and sometimes more effectively, by other international agreements and institutions. Second, counterterrorism is to be considered a priority not only for the internal security of EU Member States, but also for security of the whole Europe continent. On the other hand, however, the EU provides figures, such as theEU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, and astrategyadopted in 2005, and both of them direct Member States on an equal and coordinated path to fight terrorism at domestic level.
What is also relevant about security cooperation at European level isthe degree of data sharing among European Member States. This data are safeguarded through an advanced system of data protection, but any Member State can have access to the databases when security is concerned. The position of the UK in European cybersecurity still depends on the Brexit talks. There are very contrasting positions on this issue. The former EU security Commissioner, the British Julian King, has already stated thatin the event of a no-deal Brexit, British data will have to be immediately deleted from EU security system. However, the  UK hasdemanded to continue to have almost full accessto the Europol – the European police- database and data-sharing arrangements. It is the British intelligence, the MI6, that particularly recognizes that there would be a“weakening of data capability and data exchange capability and subsequently investigative capability in the EU and or in the UK,”as the former chied of MI6, John Scarlett, stated.
As well as British intelligence emphasizes on the importance of data sharing, theBritish police highlights the importance of the European Arrest Warrant security measure, that simplifies the extradition of people wanted for a criminal offence from one European Member State to another. Thanks to this security measure, the UK has sent to other EU countries 900 people wanted and had the opportunity of putting before a British judge almost 200 people in the period 2018-2019.
Both the EU and the UK will belosing a valuable partner and a significant position on security management and protection, if there is a no-deal Brexit.
The UK will lose access to EU databases and security measure, as previously explained. But, the EU will not only lose access to British data. The EU will lose the expertise of the British intelligence, which gives a focus to most of European case-work. The UK is, in fact, one of the major contributors to the Europol, in terms of intelligence collection and military capacity.
The UK is well aware of it. According to St-Pierre, the head of the Berlin firm Modern Security Consulting, advisor of European governments, the UK is using its electronic security capability as“major bargaining chip”.What are they bargaining for?Neither the EU and the UK are willing to strongly oppose the idea of security cooperation between the two. Yet, the problem is that an agreement would imply UK’s acceptance of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over data and privacy. And, of course, this poses relevant problems concerning UK’s sovereignty and Brexit itself.

What Does Biden’s Election Mean for Boris and Brexit?,"Joe Biden’s election as the46th President of the United Stateswas confirmed by TV networks across the globe on Saturday 7th November. The Democratic Party candidate succeeded overDonald Trumpby73 electoral votes and 3.3% of the popular vote. On the same day, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held ameetingwith EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, during which the two continued to discuss apost-Brexit UK-EU trade deal. Johnson, however, faced less success than Biden that weekend, as little was done to resolve the trade disagreements still lingering between the UK and EU.
The question now is: will Biden’s election aid Boris where clashes with the EU continue to occur?
Joe Biden has been clear in hispro-EU stance. As Vice President to Barack Obama, he declared theadministration’s preferencefor the UK to have remained in the EU, as well asstating that he personally would have voted ‘remain’. Ultimately respecting the decision, Biden has been particularly adamant that the UK take special care in preserving theGood Friday Agreement, sustaining peace in Northern Ireland, in Brexit proceedings. In September, he warned onTwitterthat the Agreement should not become a ‘casualty of Brexit‘: any future trade deal with the UK needs to be ‘contingent upon respect for the Agreement.’
Biden reiterated this to both Boris Johnson and Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, during hiscalls to international leadersfollowing his election. The new President elect indicated that peace in Northern Ireland was among his top priorities in future engagements with the UK, as it leaves the EU, and with Ireland.
Aside from his judgment on the Brexit decision, Joe Biden has also previously conveyed disapproval of Boris Johnson,likening him to Donald Trump. However, upon winning the presidency, Biden has confirmed he will continue to sustain the special relationship between the UK and US. His discussion with Boris Johnson, shortly after the election result, promised cooperation on mutual concerns, especially the global economic recovery following the Coronavirus outbreak and climate change. In hiscongratulatory noteto the new President, Boris Johnson expressed similar interests, but also stressed trade and security as part of the mutual priorities he hopes to collaborate with Biden on.
Joe Biden’s interests do not lie exclusively with Boris Johnson, however. As with the British Prime Minister, Biden also conversed with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, expressing similar interests to them. He has notified all three leaders of his wish to continue cooperating with the EU and has mentioned to Angela Merkel, specifically, his will to cooperate with Germany on a shared agenda with the EU.
Unlike Biden, Donald Trump has been anavid supporter of the Brexit decision, and of Boris Johnson. Joe Biden’s now predecessor has spoken highly of the UK Prime Minister,commending himon his efforts to secure the UK’s exit from the European Union, while simultaneouslycriticising the institution. Trump has been enthusiastic in developing a trade deal with the UK from the get-go, meeting with Johnson to accelerate negotiations as soon as the Prime Minister replaced Theresa May in July 2019. He has especiallyadvocated for the UK to enact a no-deal Brexit, claiming that this would allow the US and UK to trade ‘many times the numbers’ of current exchanges, and ‘certainly much bigger numbers’ than the UK traded with the EU.
Had Donald Trump remained in office and met his trade promises to Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister would have been expected to sustain and increase UK support to the US on a number of issues in return.One of these issues was the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, an accord designed to limit Iran’s nuclear activities, whichTrump claimed to be flawed. Trump’s planned reforms for the deal weredisputed by European leaders, except Boris Johnson,who was on board. Had Trump been elected for a second term, Johnson would have been expected to see through with his support, potentially clashing with other members of the international community. Trump has also brazenly challenged several international institutions, such as the2016 Paris Agreement, which he has successfully withdrawn the US from. Johnson was consequently putunder pressure by UK activists, scientists and politiciansto challenge Trump’s decision. During a period where he would need Trump’s support the most, the UK Prime Minister would be at a crossroads.
Joe Biden’s election will perhaps make it easier for Johnson to secure a trade deal with the US. The UK Prime Minister is no longer under pressure to join, or at least support, a Trump-led venture into challenging major establishments in the global political arena. Biden wishes tore-subscribe the US to the original nuclear deal with Iran, sustaining what President Obama had negotiated. The same applies to his commitment tore-instating US support for the Paris Agreement.  This therefore puts less pressure on Johnson to comply with actions that were intended by Trump but opposed by a majority of the international community.
On the other hand, Biden is an avid supporter of the European Union, and is equally eager to work with the EU as he is with the UK. If anything, he may prioritize consolidating US-EU relations over US-UK relations because of the multitude of opportunities an institution of 27 nations can offer, as opposed to what the UK can offer as a sole nation. Making it clear that a trade deal with the UK will primarily depend on the UK’s safeguarding of the Good Friday Agreement, Biden will potentially put more pressure on Johnson to negotiate carefully with the EU, so as not to damage future relations with the US. Joe Biden’s election may therefore pose some challenges to Johnson’s reliance on strong US support, initially set up by Trump, for the UK’s departure from the EU, as well as in its aftermath once the UK is fully sovereign.

Sacha Baron Cohen’s Political Cinema,"Sacha Baron Cohen’s films have proved wild and eye-opening time and time again. While creating his most prominent characters in the 1990s, the actor and comedian kickstarted his iconic filmography in 2002 with Ali G. Indahouse. Since then, Baron Cohen has written, produced and starred in films that, despite their extreme characters and plots, are all commonly laced with political commentary and satire. His latest instalment, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, is yet another comedy that explores several political issues.
This article looks at some of Sacha Baron Cohen’s most prominent work, exploring whether the political satire transgressing these films is in fact mere satire, or if it can qualify as political activism. Where Sacha assumes the role of activist, what exactly does he contribute to politics through his films?
If you are unfamiliar with some of Sacha Baron Cohen’s early skits, the first Borat film introduces the character ofKazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev, who travels to theUnited States of Americato learn about American culture. Set against the context of the US’ War inIraq, also termed the War on Terror, and shot only a few years after 9/11, the film explores American attitudes to foreigners and those perceived as not American. While Sacha Baron Cohen’s interpretation of a foreigner in the US is extreme, conceiving bizarre cultural differences and expressing the character’s own racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic views along the way, his performance successfully elicits concrete feelings and attitudes from the Americans he encounters.
Throughout the film, Borat learns how to act, speak and engage with other Americans through various experiences like comedy training, a feminist meeting, and a dinner on etiquette. However, the most significant and arguably most shocking moment of schooling took place during Borat’s visit to a rodeo in Tennessee. Here, Borat is lectured by rodeo producer Bobby Rowe on how he must appear less Muslim, or less terrorist. These labels are used interchangeably by Rower throughout the conversation. With the latter, Rowe reveals the prejudices he carries when he sees a Muslim, wondering “what kind of a bomb he’s got strapped on him”. The conversation moves swiftly to the topic of homosexuality, with the rodeo producer implying they should be killed. Later when Borat delivers a speech at the rodeo, he receives a rousing applause as he tells the crowd his country supports the War on Terror and declares that George Bush should “drink the blood of every single man, woman, and child of Iraq”.
This critical moment in the film begins toreveal the hostile attitudes held by some Americans to foreigners, or those they perceive as outsiders, particularly Muslims. Bobby Rowe’s mention of the War on Terror in his conversation with Borat, along with the crowd’s boisterous response to Borat’s speech, reveal that the hostility, and the prejudices that come with it, are upheld by the film’s context: the US’ War in Iraq. Sacha Baron Cohen highlights the prevailing narratives surrounding the US’ involvement in the War, and reveals the prejudices and widespread sense of threat stemming from such narratives. Borat ultimately shows how public opinion can be manipulated to uphold the justifications for a foreign policy action.
Centred around the character of a homosexual Austrian fashion reporter trying to attain fame in the United States, the film Brüno explores attitudes towards homosexuality in the US, and the homophobia that often stems from these attitudes. The film takes us through topics like same-sex parenthood, same-sex marriage, homosexual conversion therapy and stereotypes based on sexual orientation. Even when not directly confronted, these themes prevail in the film’s backdrop: American society. A subtle yet telling moment saw Brüno and Lutz pass a group of protestors bearing signs with the statements ‘God hates fags’ and ‘Fags are worthy of death’, among others. A more overt situation in the film occurred when Brüno and Lutz began a love scene during a cage match in Arkansas. This led to an aggressive reaction from the audience very quickly.
Similar to the nature of revelations in Borat,Brüno highlights the different levels of social reception to homosexuality, and the way this can lead to homophobia. Sacha Baron Cohen has later explained the “violent potential of homophobia” that the cage match scene in Arkansas exposes. Brüno is therefore equally powerful to Borat in its focus on the negative attitudes to sexual orientation still encased in the American culture, and the way these can often become dangerous. The more subtle moments in the film, like the appearance of the homophobic protestors, are significant in their ability to shock viewers, despite how ordinary their position in American culture may seem. It is arguable that Sacha Baron Cohen is demonstrating political activism in the inclusion of such scenes, as he is essentially asking the audience:Should this be normal?
Aside from the issues of homosexuality and homophobia, one of the more outlandish situations in the film are Brüno’s efforts to establish peace betweenIsraelandPalestine. While he’s hosting talks between Israeli ex-Mossad Chief Yossi Alpher and former Palestinian Minister Ghassan Khatib, as well as Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Avraham Sela and Palestinian Governor of Jerusalem Adnan al-Husseini, Brüno misdirects the respective discussions to irrelevant topics, to ultimately get nowhere.
Other than Sela’s affirmation that the conflict is about “gaining something for your own people”, the discussions reveal northing more from each side. The fact that Brüno urges a quick solution reveals his ignorance to the longstanding and insoluble nature of the conflict. It is fair to suggest this scene serves a comedic purpose only; the discussion does not contribute to politics in any manner. However, Sacha Baron Cohen does shine a light on the political issue, potentiallymagnifying its significance considering the bizarre storyline it is placed in.
Unlike Borat and Brüno, The Dictator is not a documentary. Hailing from fictitious Wadiya, the character of Admiral General Aladeen provides an over-the-top image of aNorth African leader as he fights to reclaim his dictatorship. The film provides many satirical political references, however, the most notable remark takes place at the end. Ahead of signing a new democracy-enabling constitution for Wadiya, Aladeen gives a speech on democracy versus dictatorship.
Firstly, he cites that bringing democracy to Wadiya would become a “licence for oil companies and foreign interests” to destroy it. This echoes a common accusation that foreign interests aiming to ‘revolutionize’ the Middle East merely create channels for further intervention and profit. As the character is compared to late Libyan leaderMuammar al-Gaddafi, so are the global efforts in the film to bring democracy to Wadiya, as real life efforts tried inLibya.
Aladeen then asks the audience to imagine America as a dictatorship, proceeding to list the elements that would constitute a dictatorship but are already found in the US. His examples include letting the top 1% retain all of the nation’s wealth; having one family control the nation’s media, which otherwise appears free; having the ability to torture foreign prisoners; and filling prisons with one particular racial group. Aladeen’s speech is laced with irony that compels the audience to question how democratic America, and other democracies, actually are. This can be taken as bordering political activism, yet still remaining in the area of political commentary.
Although Sacha Baron Cohen asks the audience to bear these elements in mind, he does not call for any direct changes as Aladeen’s speech is concluded by listing the positive aspects of democracy, settling on the idea that democracy is not perfect but still good.
The sequel to Borat changes course from the first film as it delves deeper into America’s internal politics, rather than attitudes to the outside and the other. While still exploring common themes of religion, feminism and racial issues, the film centres on its context of Trump’s America and the first months of the Coronavirus pandemic. Although the film is most recognized for a scene in which Borat’s daughter Tutar interviews Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, stirring debate on how appropriately Giuliani acted in the interview, it deserves equal attention for its exploration of American party politics and attitudes surrounding Covid-19.
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm explores the contemporary and contentious issue of fact versus fiction, focusing specifically on conspiracy theories and the role played by social media and party politics in propelling such theories. A particular scene in the film depicts an argument between Borat and Tutar over theconspiracy theorieshe has been feeding her, during which she claims to have found “a new book which only tells the truth, it’s called Facebook”. Tutar declares that Facebook teaches her facts like the Holocaust having never taken place, showing a Facebook post in which this is stated. An unscripted moment, however, occurs during Borat’s conversation with two Republican men who tell him Democrats are more dangerous than Coronavirus and claim to have heard that Hillary Clinton murders children and drinks their blood. Furthermore, when performing a song at an event for Republican supporters, Borat elicits cheers from the crowd when he sings “Corona is a liberal hoax” and that scientists should be fed to the bears.
Sacha Baron Cohen’s deliberate inclusion of the scene discussing Facebook is a clear form of political activism. It complements the comedian’s personal campaign to strengthen social media regulations surrounding free speech and the sharing of conspiracy theories. Through the film and through his personal expressions, he highlights the dangerous potential of fake news. Borat’s conversation with the two Republicans, along with the response he receives for his song, reinforce the film’s mission to ask the audience to consider how such opinions on facts and fictions are influenced, how they are consequently expressed, and the possible threat of spreading such opinions.
Sacha Baron Cohen has also lent his voice to projects like theTrial of the Chicago 7. This Aaron Sorkin film depicts the true story of the 1969 Chicago 7 Trial in which several anti-Vietnam War groups were convicted of conspiracy to incite a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. As well as being an associate producer on the film, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Abbie Hoffman, who led the Youth International Party with Jerry Rubin.
The Party played a crucial role in organising the anti-Vietnam War protest, for which the pair were convicted, alongside several other groups. The film illustrates the numerous injustices faced by the groups during the trial, and particularly the racial discrimination faced by national chairman of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale. Released in the same year as the worldwideBlack Lives Matterprotests, the film closely mirrors current political contexts. It can be taken as an accompaniment to today’s activist movements, as it brings attention to the injustices faced over 50 years ago – the same injustices prevailing today.

Defence Spending: Is The UK Developing A Foreign Policy Strategy?,"Brexit threw theUnited Kingdom’s foreign policy into dilemma. The uncertainty of its future relationship with theEuropean Unionand its members, and more recently the uncertainty of theUnited States presidential election winner, has led to a pause in the development of a clear or coherent foreign policy strategy. TheCovid-19 pandemichas also thrown another spanner in the works as every country has had to prioritise domestic governance and turn inwards, discouraging international travel.
Currently,the UK remains close to EU positions on climate change, on steps toprevent nuclear proliferation in Iranandon excluding Russia from the G7. However, it also aligns itself to the US and the Five Eyes intelligence community (Australia, Canada and New Zealand), with its harder stance on China and Hong Kong. There is currently no clear overall strategy.
With the development of a vaccine with above 90% effectiveness, the pandemic’s end is in sight. Looking forward internationally,two of the most important foreign policy relationships will be with Europe and the US. For the US,China’s economic prosperity and its fast-developing position in the world threatens its current hegemonic status. As the UK currently remains tough on China, weary of security risks such as Huawei 5G and its expansionist ambitions and growing influence over South-East Asia, it is likely to side with the US in any upcoming conflicts. Johnson’s current attitude towards the international system suggests that he is expecting conflict, as he announced on the 19thNovember that the ‘international situation is now more perilous and intensely competitive than at any time since the Cold War’. However, will the aim of this allegiance to be create a two-prong hegemony, balancing power with the US and soundly batting down China; or will it to be to work towards a global equilibrium of power in a multilateral international system?
WithBrexitfast approaching, perhaps the latter is not in pro-Brexit Johnson’s priorities, andthe announcement of a £16.5 billion increase in defence spending could be an attempt to bond withpresident-elect Biden. Unfortunately for Johnson, Biden has been clear in his pro-EU stance particularly in regards to protecting the Good Friday Agreement;Donald Trumpwas a far more enthusiastic supporter of Brexit. If positive relationships with EU member-nations and European support in combatting China are in Johnson’s priority, the current state of Brexit negotiations, with neither side currently wishing to be the first to cooperate, may suggest this strategy is failing.
However,the EU is not the only relationship the UK shares with Europe, and though it has voted to leave, it will remain an important member of other international institutions such as NATO, the United Nations and its security council. Then, it will be up to countries individually to make agreements with the UK, creating individual trade deals and bilateral agreements which, at this moment, none have done. Further negotiations have also been damaged by Johnson’s breaking of international law with the publication of the Internal Market Bill, which has left many nations distrustful of the UK’s position on honouring agreements, and as its central facet concerned Northern Ireland it will not have pleased pro-Good Friday Agreement Biden.
Covid-19 has been predicted to bring about a major recession, as has Brexit, especially in the event of a No-Deal. Johnson has used these predictions to justifycutting the UK’s foreign aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of the GDP. 0.7% of a nation’s GDP is the United Nation’s official development assistance (ODA) target, so this move would drop the UK from the current list of countries meeting that target. Johnson’s drop in international aid was one of the fears expressed when he decided to merge the Department for International Development (DfID)  and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in June 2020, and his direction would suggest international aid is not a priority of this government. The announcement to commit extra funding to the defence budget is somewhat discordant with its current line on public spending and Labour leader Kier Starmer has questioned the Prime Minister on the source of this extra spending. Johnson’s response has been topromote the new jobs created in a ‘renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK’, which he estimates at 40,000.
Johnson’s decision to commit £16.5 billion in defence spending is a clear indication of his hope for a closer relationship with the US, now under Biden, as the US consistently values a large military budget. It is also a worldwide message towards competitors, particularly towards China, thatthe UK will not be sitting down during its rise to power. It is evident that international aid and development are not prominent in Johnson’s foreign policy plans and this may lead to further strain in his relationship with EU member states, who remain some of the biggest contributors to donor countries.

Ritorno Di Fiamma Nel Sahara Occidentale,"La questione dell’indipendenza del Sahara Occidentale aveva raggiunto negli ultimi anni una preoccupante situazione di stallo, tanto da venir considerata comeuno degli ultimi casi di colonizzazione irrisolta. Lo scorso mese tuttavia, la contesa sembra aver ripreso vita.
Per capire le origini della disputa sul Sahara Occidentale è necessario risalire al1975, quando, in seguito al ritiro spagnolo dalla regione, ilMaroccoha annesso una parte dell’area, tra l’altro ricca di risorse naturali, al suo regno. In risposta, nel 1976 il Fonte Polisario, movimento indipendentista nato nel 1973, annunciava la nascita dellaRepubblica Democratica Araba dei Sahrawi (RASD), costituendo un governo in esilio inAlgeriae dando vita a una guerriglia per l’indipendenza che sarebbe durata fino al 1991. Quello stesso annole Nazioni Unitepromossero il cessate il fuoco e istituirono laMissione delle Nazioni Unite per il referendum nel Sahara Occidentale(MINURSO), incaricata di vigilare sul rispetto della fine delle ostilità e di iniziare un processo che avrebbe dovuto portare alla realizzazione di un referendum popolare sull’indipendenza del Sahara Occidentale, ad oggi mai avvenuto.
Da allorala situazione si è andata gradualmente a cristallizzare, beneficiando in particolar modo il Marocco, che appunto detiene il controllo di gran parte del territorio del Sahara Occidentale, anche grazie alla costruzione delBerm, un muro di sabbia di circa 2.720 km eretto per motivi di difesa che ha di fatto relegato la RASD ad amministrare solo una piccola parte di territorio desertico ai confini tra Algeria e Mauritania. La zona contesa, oltre ad avere un’importanza strategica a livello regionale, ospita importanti risorse economiche, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la pesca e il fosfato, e si vocifera giacimenti di petrolio, motivo per cui il Marocco non intende retrocedere, ma anzi sfruttare appieno la ricchezza della regione.
Per rafforzare la propria sovranità sul Sahara Occidentale, il Marocco ha da anni messo in campo unaccorto lavoro diplomatico che lo ha riportato al rientro ufficiale nell’Unione Africana, da cui era uscito negli anni ’80 proprio in seguito al riconoscimento da parte dell’Unione della RASD, eall’instaurazione di uno stretto legame con alcuni stati, sia arabi che africani, i quali hanno sostenuto le rivendicazioni marocchine con l’apertura simbolica di sedi consolari nelle principali città della costa saharawi. Pablo de Orellana, ricercatore specializzato sul conflitto presso il King’s College di Londra, ha affermato chela strategia marocchinadi promuovere una narrativa che inquadra il Polisario come separatisti illegittimi controllati dall’Algeria, principale alleato del popolo Saharawi,sta decisamente funzionando, aiutando il Marocco ad ottenere maggiore supporto internazionale sulla questione. Primo fra gli alleati di Re Mohamed VI è naturalmente laFrancia, che intrattiene solide relazioni economiche con Rabat e che, essendo membro permanente nel Consiglio di Sicurezza dell’ONU, ha un ruolo significativo nel tenere la situazione in stallo e nell’ostacolare l’indipendenza dei Saharawi.
In questo contesto, innegabile èl’indifferenza e l’incapacità delle Nazioni Unite di far avanzare il processo di pace. MINURSO infatti, fondata quasi 3 decenni fa, non è ancora riuscita ad attuare pienamente la sua missione e la sua prolungata inerzia non fa che deteriorare la situazione sul campo, dando un’ulteriore occasione al Marocco di cementare lo status quo e la sua sovranità sul Sahara Occidentale. Lo scorso 31 ottobre, l’ONU ha rinnovato il mandato della missione di un ulteriore anno, ma la speranza che possa realmente dare una svolta alla situazione si sta affievolendo.Il referendum per l’indipendenza saharawiè stato infatti rimandatoper l’ennesima volta, motivo a cui molti imputano la recente escalation di violenze nell’area.
Dal 21 ottobre il Fronte Polisario infatti bloccava la circolazione di merci e persone nell’area diGuerguerat, lungo la strada chiave che collega Marocco eMauritaniain segno di protesta. Così il 13 novembre, in risposta alle “provocazioni” degli indipendentisti, l’esercito marocchino è intervenuto per ripristinare la circolazione, intensificando le tensioni nel territorio contestato e minacciando una fragile tregua che dura da quasi 30 anni.
Il rischio quindi è che la questione rimanga una ferita aperta, capace di mettere in luce sempre di più l’incapacità del sistema internazionale, a partire dal suo apice, le Nazioni Unite, di trovare soluzioni praticabili e disinnescare una crisi che potrebbe avere pericolose ripercussioni in tutta la regione.

A Step Forward in Sino-Vatican Relations,"In July 2020, Recorded Future, an American cybersecurity company,produced a reportdetailing how theVaticanand several other Catholic organizations had been victims of various hacking attacks conducted bya group called RedDelta. The article, developed by Insikt Group, Recorded Future’s threat intelligence research unit, pointed out that the attacks began in May 2020 and continued until at least July 21, 2020. Moreover, it highlighted how RedDelta is allegedly sponsored by and known for engaging in cyberattacks against targets of strategic interest for the Chinese government.
The attacks were carried out through the use of a lure document whichallowed RedDelta to intrude the Vatican systems. The document in question was presented as an official Vatican letter addressed to the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China. It is still unclear if the letter was forged by the group or if it was obtained and altered in order to get an access point for the incursions.
While similar attacks included other organizations and institutions (i.e. the Indonesian Ministry of Home Affairs, the Airports Authority of India), the question of why RedDelta would choose the Vatican as one of its targets remains unanswered.
Although addressing this question is not an easy task, understanding the complex historical relations between the two countries could be the first step in finding an answer to it.
The first real breach in diplomatic relations between Beijing and the Holy Seetook place in 1951, just a few years after the foundation of the People’s Republic of China. After many attempts to pressure the Vatican, the Chinese government orchestrated a crisis with the scope of removing the apostolic mission from its territory.
The accident resulted in the execution of Antonio Riva, an Italian businessman accused of participating in a conspiracy to assassinate Mao Zedong, a life sentence for the regional apostolic prefect Tarcisio Martina and the banishment of the Vatican’s diplomatic mission from the country,under the accusation of espionage. After this event, Beijing established two conditions for the Holy See to satisfy in order to reinstate its diplomatic relations with China: to abstain from interfering in religious matters and to break any ties with the Taipei government.
While the Holy See has shown no particular reservations in fulfilling the latter request, the former remains a point of considerable contentiondue to its intrinsic vagueness. The strongest point of disagreement between the two countries concerns the appointment of bishops in China. Although Beijing has been appointing its own bishops through the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the Holy See,while recognizing the possibilityof consulting with civil authorities on the matter, states that such poweris an exclusive prerogative of the Pope.
A radical shift in the Holy See’s approach to China was seenafter the election of Pope Benedict XVIwho, in 2007,declared his opennessto engaging in a dialogue with the Chinese authorities in the attempt to mend the relations between the two international actors.
This move by the newly elected pontifex represented a considerable change in the Vatican’s diplomatic strategy when engaging with communist governments. It is well-known that Pope John Paul II played an important role in the fall of the USSR by protecting states which sought to break away from the Union and funding its opponents working behind Iron Curtain. His anti-communist stance was so crucial to him, in fact, that during the first visit ofPresident Reaganto the Vatican in 1982, the two leaders immediately developed a strong bond over their shared views on the subject.
It was only with the election of Pope John Paul II’s successor that this strategy was abandoned in favor of a softer, more conciliatory one. In recent years, actions from both Beijing and the Vatican have shown some signals ofreconciliation.The Vatican has expressed its willingnessto develop new diplomatic ties with Beijing on the condition that the Chinese government grant more freedom of religion to its citizen and abstainfrom interfering with the ecclesiastical hierarchyoperating within its borders.
Ever since 2007, when the appointment of Father Joseph Li Shan as bishop conducted by the Chinese authoritieswas tacitly accepted by the Holy See, the two countries have grown closer, and the election of Pope Francis in 2013marked an ulterior steptowards the rapprochement between them.
The milder position firstly introduced by Pope Benedict XVI has been continued to be supported by the current Pope, who has shown a strong interest in improving the Vatican’s relations with China and the goal of ameliorating the conditions of Catholics living in the country.
On September 22, 2018, Beijing and the Vaticansigned their first provisional agreementrelated to the matter of bishops’ appointment in China, which entered into function one month after its signing and initially lasted for two years. While no official diplomatic ties were formeddue to the Holy See’s recognition of Taiwan, the agreement granted the Popethe power of vetoing the bishopsproposed by Beijing, in exchange for his recognition of the seven bishopspreviously appointedwithout papal approval.
As the agreement end date was getting closer and the Vatican demonstrated interest in renewing it for two more years, the United States’ administration voiced its concerns with the decision. On September 19, 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed his opposition to the agreement’s renewal by statingthrough a tweetthat the Vatican’s decision to pursue such a diplomatic path would endanger its moral authority. The Vatican’s “silent” response arrived during the following week when, as Pompeo was visiting the state, the Pope declined any meeting with him and justified his choiceby mentioning the proximity of the U.S. election.
Despite the criticisms voiced by the U.S. Secretary of State, the Provisional Agreement was finally renewed for two more years and will remain in place until October 22, 2022. His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, has pointed out how the agreement is entirely focused on the appointment of bishops and that, although there are many other questions concerning the Catholic Church in China,it would be impossible to address all of them at once.
More than this, such a result is considered by the Holy See to be not only the destination of a long diplomatic journey conducted by the two parties involved but also the point of departure for more encompassing agreements in the future.
For now, one of the main results of this agreement is the appointment of His Excellency Antonio Yao Shun for the Diocese of Jining in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and of His Excellency Stefano Xu Hongwei for the Diocese of Hanzhong within the Shaanxi Province.

Nigeria #EndSARS Movement: Where Is It Now?,"Protests againstNigeria‘s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) erupted in October this year, when a video showing a young man being shot by the special forces emerged online. Anti-SARS sentiment has prevailed throughout Nigeria for many years now, as the policing organisation became increasingly associated with abuse, torture, and unjust killings. The viral video pushed this sentiment into the streets and acrosssocial mediaas the Nigerian people, and others across the globe, called out the police brutality occurring at the hands of SARS.
Protestors facedgovernment crackdownas a result; a nationwide curfew was put in place and organisers were targeted with such punishments like having their bank accounts frozen. The demonstrations intensified on 20th October, when members of theNigerian police force shot into crowds of protestorsin Lagos, killing at least 12 people.
Following pressure from protestors, as well as international leaders, the Nigerian government has since responded to the movement and the protests have subsequently died down. However, there is still widespreadcynicism about the official response, doubting that the promised reforms will be enough to endpolice brutalityin the country. This doubt may ignite the protests again.
International players had become particularly vocal about the Nigerian protests after the October 20th shootings.United Nations Secretary General António Guterrescalled on both sides to refrain from violence, while demanding Nigerian authorities to investigate cases of police brutality and hold the perpetrators of such brutality to account.UN human rights expertshad highlighted the fact that the shootings by security forces against protestors confirmed the movement’s concern with police brutality. Deeming the situation ‘disturbing’, the experts further outlined the security forces’ efforts to cover up their actions by turning off lights and security cameras. The UN has therefore expressed support for the movement, taking a clear stance indemanding accountability.
TheChairperson of the African Union (AU)Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, has also called on both protestors and security forces to cease the violence surrounding the protests. He emphasised the importance of mutual dialogue to develop ‘concrete and durable reforms’. Recognising the necessity of reforms reflects the Union’s support of the #EndSARS cause. However, in clarifying that the AU stands by the Nigerian Government as well as the Nigerian people, Mahamat stresses that a peaceful solution is a priority.
In response to #EndSARS protests across London, as well as an online petition demanding action, theUK Parliament has called on its Government to demand that Nigerian officials investigate the police brutalityagainst Nigerian citizens by security forces like SARS. The government has agreed to monitor the investigation and work with Nigeria to implement reforms. Parliament agreed not to impose sanctions against Nigeria, reasoning that this would hurt the Nigerian people, but it has called on the UK government to sanction those responsible for abuses against protestors. This proposition is still under consideration.
Members of Parliament have, however,  called out the UK Government for itsfunding and training of Nigerian security forces, including SARS, since 2016. The UK Minster of Africa, James Duddridge, initially disputed this claim but has since confirmed it. Concerns surround the UK’s involvement in Nigeria’s policing system, considering that knowledge of SARS’ actions has been public for at least a decade. The #EndSARS movement was very much associated with anational crisis, however has since demonstrated the significant role international players can perform in a country’s internal governance, even if the role is non-military and not conflict-associated. Unless it takes direct action, such as the imposition of sanctions, the UK’s response may be deemed hollow and hypocritical.
Like the UK, US officials have called for Nigeria to investigate abuses by its security forces. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hasstatedthat those responsible for excessive force should be held accountable under Nigerian law. He has also stressed the importance of upkeeping the right to peaceful assembly, while calling on both sides to remain calm. Equally,Joe Bidenhas expressed the need for the US to support Nigerians demonstrating for police reform. He has called on Nigerian officials to‘cease the violent crackdown’ and ‘engage in a good-faith dialogue with civil society’.

Considering that the US experiencedits own nationwide police brutality protests earlier in the year, its response to these internal demonstrations should be reflected in its approach to the Nigerian movement. #EndSARS shares significant commonalities with the Black Lives Matter movement that has originated in the US and escalated across the world. While Mike Pompeo has called for accountability and peace amid Nigeria’s protests, emphasising the right to peaceful assembly, he wascriticized in the initial weeks of the BLM protestsfor remaining silent on the issues brought forth by US demonstrators. In such cases, the weight of international input is brought to question when diplomatic statements do not entirely reflect domestic actions.
Nigeria’s President,Muhammadu Buhari, has attempted to appease protestors’ demands byannouncing the disbandment of SARSon 11th October, highlighting that this was the first step in reform. This received little praise, however. The decision to dissolve the organisation had echoed past government moves made in response to popular discontentment about the security forces.Reforms were previously announced in 2016, to address the use of excessive force by SARS units. These followed various other reform efforts, with the first proposed in 2006.
The announcements that SARS officers would be redeployed and the organisation replaced by a Special Weapons and Tactics team (SWAT) fuelled scepticism and distrust further, as this hardly qualified for a systemic overhaul. The protests persisted, running on doubt and demanding further reform. The movement’s doubts seemed to be confirmed by the October 2oth killings, in which Nigeria’s security forces exercised abuse again.
Following the killings,Vice President Yemi Osinbajowas the first official to release astatement.Osinbajo expressed his condolences for both the protestors and police officers who had lost their lives during the violent outbreak, promising justice for these victims.Despite not mentioning the shootings in his first address to the nation after they took place (an address in which he called for an end to protests and prompted a dialogue between protestors and Government),President Buharilater reiterated his promises of police reform.
Since then, Nigeria’s state governments have implementedjudicial panelsacross the country to investigate cases of police brutality and persecute those responsible for abuses. The Nigerian Police Force, however, has institutedlegal action to stop these proceedingson the basis that state governors have no right to investigate the police; only the federal government does. This legal bid is now subject to investigation itself because the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has denied permitting the lawsuit and has consequently guaranteed his support of ongoing police reforms.
The way the Nigerian Police Force’s lawsuit will proceed may be most indicative of the Government’s approach to the #EndSARS movement. If the Police Force wins its case, ending police brutality investigations,civil unrest will likely ensueas this will erase the accountability the population relied on and was promised.
However, if  the #EndSARS movement is to followthe trajectory of Black Lives Matter in the US, then it is possible that the cause for mass demonstration has fizzled out. Although the US Government has imposed changes to the policing system in an attempt to placate protestors,cases of police brutality continue to occur throughout the country. Mass protests on the scale that we saw them in May and June, however, are no longer taking place. Therefore, while the Nigerian Government’s efforts to initiate police reforms have currently shown little progress in light of the Police Force’s pushback on investigations, we may no longer see the same alarm and anger displayed in the first wave of #EndSARS protests.
Arecent terrorist attackin north-east of Nigeria has, however, emboldened the scepticism surrounding the Nigerian Government’s leadership, including its response to the #EndSARS protests.Organisations, such as the Northern Elders Forum, have re-directed criticism towards President Buhari, calling for his resignation. The Forum has accused the administration of failing to protect the security and welfare of Nigerians by neglecting the threat posed by terrorist groups in the country. Therefore, while not specifically linked to #EndSARS, national demonstrations may be kickstarted again as civilians join to express disapproval of the Government.

"The Case of Ethiopia: United We Stand, Divided We Fall","On November 4 2020, Ethiopia started a conflict that has caused a humanitarian crisis as well as major disruptions to the population and international community. Moreover, the world is shocked thatPrime Minister AbiyAhmed, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for signing the peace deal with Eritrea, started the conflict against theTigrayregion in Northern Ethiopia.
On the first day, Prime MinisterAbiystarted a military offensive against the Tigray region after some soldiers from theTigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF)launched an attack against a Government military post, taking military weaponry. Since then, the Government and the Tigray region, specifically the TPLF forces, have been fighting each other.
Despite the fact that the conflict started due to a criminal act, the real conflict circles around the concept ofethnic division. In fact, before the conflict itself, Ethiopia was already divided by ethnicity and the underlying senses of superiority between the different ethnicities. This was seen in2018, when Prime Minister Abiy, who is originally from the region of Oromia, took power and immediately targeted Tigray, launching a wave of arrests and discharging all the military officials from Tigray, which he regarded as corrupted. As a consequence of this, there have been reports that innocent civilians, who have not been taking part in this conflict, have been suffering atrocities from the two warring sides due to their ethnic background. Although, it is impossible to know the exact events as communication in Tigray has been shut down.
According to aCNNreport on November 12, it appears that 150 people “from ‘ethnically diverse‘ backgrounds have also been detained in the capitalAddis Ababaand various parts of the country, on suspicion of colluding with TPLF to incite ‘conflicts and carrying terror attacks’”. Furthermore, on November 10, it wasreportedthat hundreds of Tigrayans were killed with machetes and knives inMai Kadra, a little town in the region of Tigray. Although, again, the exact numbers remain unconfirmed due to lack of unofficial international investigation on the ground. While the culprit remains unconfirmed, due to the lack of investigation, witness reports claim the force of the Amhara region launched the attack.
This is also regarded as a crime driven by ethnic division andethnic nationalism. In fact, theAmhara region, which has had a history with Tigray over territorial disputes, might use this conflict to “recaptur[e] territories they claim were unlawfully taken by Tigray, such as Wolkait, and mov[e] closer to their dream of reinstalling national unity by eliminating the TPLF”(Allo, 2020). With this ethnic nationalism in mind, the TPLF has also been resisting and fighting back, as it launched rockets to the Amhara region on November 20.
As a consequence of this conflict, and of these ethnic divisions,more than 30,000 Tigrayans, as of November 19, have fled to Sudanto seek security from ethnic persecutions. Not able to cope with the overflow, theUN refugee camps in Sudanare concerned as they cannot assure they can provide their services to the refugees. As such, the UN has been trying to broaden the camps in order to welcome 200,000 more refugees over the following six months, as it seems the conflict will not end soon.
This situation and the subsequent humanitarian crisis is closely linked to the evolution of the conflict, which now seems will likely be prolonged. Back in Tigray, Prime MinisterAbiyhas declared the central government has secured multiple cities in the warring region, but has been pushed back by the resistance of the TPLF. After having given an ultimatum of 72 hours to surrender,Abiyhas declared on November 27 that “he is launching the ‘final phase’ of the army’s operation” in Tigray’s capital Mekelle. Already following the announcement of the ultimatum, the TPLF has declared that they will “keep fighting”.
Although the situation is still developing, given precedents and the worrying chasm between the ethnicities, theUNwarns the Prime Minister that if Mekelle were to be attacked, there will be a “potential for serious violations of international humanitarian human rights law”, as the civilians will be trapped in the city during the attack. Nevertheless, Abiy has assured they will work with the UN to protect the civilians amid the attack.
The conflict is still ongoing and evolving every minute. Nevertheless, it seems that the conflict, driven by ethnic nationalism, will likely be prolonged and the humanitarian crisis will deepen. Given their antagonism, the region of Tigray and the central government, backed up by the region of Amhara, will most likely keep fighting. From one side, this will be to gain more territory or ethnic superiority. From the other side: to keep the Tigray under the Government’s control. Even if Mekelle were to be taken by the Government’s troops,expertsare warning that the TPLF “could be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government”.

Covid-19 Vaccine: The Global Race for Production and Distribution,"TheCoronaviruspandemic has evolved into an international competition to produce and secure the doses of the first Covid-19 vaccine. Countries from each corner of the globe are racing to tackle the virus within their respective borders.The competition is two-fold, concerning both production and distribution. Some of the biggest players on the international stage are heavily investing in their national development of a vaccine.
On one hand, this is motivated by aneed to protect citizens. However, it is also driven by the promisedbenefitsof astrengthened global positionfor the first producer of an approved vaccine. Equally, the process of distribution has become a political competition amongst nations, regarding accessibility to doses.
Several countries have been working to develop the firstCoronavirus vaccine, however, five countries are now completing phase 3 of trials: the USA, UK, Germany, Russia, and China. This final phase examines the vaccine’s effectiveness in large groups of people and identifies potential side effects arising in these groups(Gavi, 2020). It is therefore safe to say thatthese are the countries leading the global race for the development of the first Covid-19 vaccine.
Russia was the first country to register a vaccinein August this year, despite the fact that the vaccine had not yet been tested in phase 3 trials and had not been submitted for international approval. Therefore,discourse surrounding the Russian vaccine has been broadly sceptical, with the primary concern being that the vaccine has not been tested on a large group of people. In November, US companyModerna filed for approvalof its vaccine following phase 3 trials,as has Chinese firm Sinopharm. The US and GermanPfizer-Biontech vaccine had also concluded phase 3 trialsin late November, and has since become the first vaccine to be approved, with theUK becoming the first country to roll it out.
The country whose vaccine is approved first will arguably earn a stronger geopolitical and economic position. With those leading the race being major global players like the US, UK, Russia, and China,the competition to receive approval has merely added to existing political and economic competition between these nations. Expectedly, the first country to produce an internationally approved vaccine will be most depended on to aid other global players in combatting the virus within their borders.Following its approval of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine, the UK has instantly announced plans for mass vaccination within the country. We can therefore expect that both the US and Germany will significantly benefit from this landmark approval, as the company is likely to secure instant orders from other nations following in the UK’s footsteps. Such an advantageous position grants the opportunity to remedy internal damages caused by COVID-19 in a country (or countries, in this case), such as ameliorating an economic crisis.
However, existing global political relations need to be considered:who sides with who?It is not guaranteed that the first producer of an approved vaccine will be the one most nations turn to. Existing alliances mean that nations have already secured preferences among each other, despite who leads the race. Although scepticism has clouded Russia’s vaccine, mainly from the West,Turkish authorities have engaged in talks with Russiato secure doses of the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute. This is a testament to Russia and Turkey’s alliance, which has served the two countries previously during the international conflict, and now during a pandemic.
Propaganda and bias have also played a significant role in vaccine-producing countries’ geopolitical credibility. Countries developing vaccines have been denouncing each other’s efforts in research and development. It is therefore not so much a matter of who is first, but who is trusted. US President Donald Trump has often called COVID-19 the ‘Chinese virus‘ and hasopenly criticized Chinaover its management of the then epidemic. The President’s National Security AdvisorRobert O’Brien has later claimed that China has attempted to steal COVID-19 vaccine researchfrom the West. Such rhetoric influences the extent to which China’s vaccine development is deemed credible by the West, primarily the US.
Despite the widespread focus on who would be the first to release an approved COVID-19 vaccine, numerous pre-purchase agreements have already been in place worldwide for doses of forthcoming vaccines.Countries across the world have secured multiple options for acquiring vaccine doses, through deals with several nations and institutions at once.This includes the countries which are working to develop a vaccine themselves, as they continue to secure additional doses for their citizens.Pfizer-Biontech is therefore not the only company that will be facing an onslaught of orders,as existing deals have already shown reliance on numerous vaccine developers.
Those who have already secured large numbers of vaccine doses throughpre-purchase agreementsare predominantly higher-income countries and are ultimately ahead in this race. TheUS, Japan, the United Kingdom and European countries have secured around a quarter of currently available doses.The disproportionate access to COVID-19 vaccines has raisedconcern.Within the initial months of a vaccine’s release, only a finite number of doses will be available. With wealthier countries buying up currently available vaccine doses, there is concern that low-income countries will get left behind, hindering their ability to tackle the virus.
Covaxwas set up as a response to these concerns. Led by the Vaccine Alliance Gavi, the World Health Organisation, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the organisation works to advance the development of COVID-19 vaccines and solve the issue posed by accessibility to vaccines. With a membership of 186 countries,Covax’s mission statement is to ensure an equitable distribution of vaccines globally.Many of Covax’s members are contributors to the organisation’s fund to distribute vaccines to low and middle-income countries in need.
However, while members of Covax are helping to supply vaccines, they continue to make independent pre-purchase agreements for vaccine doses to their own countries. TheEuropean Union has pledged 500 million euros to Covaxso far, bringing the organisation closer to its target of 2 billion doses for the 92 countries in need. The EU, however, continues to acquire separate contracts with pharmaceutical companies and hassecured at least 1 billion doses for its 27 member states so far. Although it should be noted that the EU provides the option to its members to donate their allocated doses to lower and middle-income countries.
Chinahas also introduced efforts to ensure the distribution of vaccines around the world. Coined ‘vaccine diplomacy‘, China’s initiative is a response to the issue of unequal accessibility to vaccines, as well as a response to the criticism it has received from countries like the US amid COVID-19.The country has therefore independently committed to distributing its vaccines equitably around the world and has offered to provide loans to lower-income countries to be able to purchase vaccines.

Da 100 Giorni In Bielorussia È Sempre Domenica,"Sono passati più di cento giorni dall’inizio delle proteste contro il regime corrotto diAleksandr Lukašenkoin Bielorussia. Ed ancora adesso, a dispetto della stanchezza, del sopraggiungere dell’inverno,della pandemiaedell’alta probabilità di essere malmenati o detenuti,centinaia di persone ogni domenica a Minsk scendono in piazza a protestare.
Si esce di casa senza sapere se si farà ritorno. Ci si prepara per uscire, portando con sé questa consapevolezza. Alcuni di manifestanti portano anche acqua e qualcosa da mangiare, nel caso vengano arrestati e lasciati senza cibo. Sanno bene che queste detenzioni sono frequenti e assolutamente arbitrare. A fronte del carattere pacifico delle proteste, la polizia e il personale di sicurezza sono stati infatti dispiegati in uno schema sistematico diuso non giustificato o eccessivo della forza contro manifestanti.
Iniziata il 10 agosto 2020,la protesta anti-governativa non smette e non indietreggia. Non ne ha alcuna intenzione. Il numero delle vittime della repressione sale di giorno in giorno. Ma la paura non scalfisce la determinazione di questo popolo che ha scelto di fare fronte unito per liberarsi di un regime che ha da tempo smesso di rappresentarlo. C’è una grande fiducia che un cambiamento sia alle porte: “abbiamo solo bisogno di più tempo,” diceil leader dell’opposizione Svetlana Tichanovskaja, in esilio in Lituania da dove continua a guidare il Consiglio di coordinamento, che riunisce gli oppositori al regime e gli esponenti della società civile.
La paura non ha ancora piegato il morale della gente, che si riversa numerosa per strada, chiedendo le dimissioni del presidente. Il clima delle proteste è di forte unità e di incredibile entusiasmo. Ed è proprio questo sentimento che eleva l’ideale di una “Bielorussa libera” a priorità individuale prima che collettiva. È la fotografia di un momento di irripetibile unità nazionale, di un paese che ha ritrovato coraggio, che si è emancipato dal terrore della repressione. Oggi la Bielorussia parla ad una voce sola.
L’utilizzo dellostorico vessillo biancorossoè diventato – non a caso – il simbolo della protesta, rievocando l’antico sentimento democratico, patriottico ma soprattutto anti-autoritario in tutte le forze sociali che si oppongono al governo.
“Questa è la nostra terra. Andatevene dalla nostra terra!”
gridano i manifestanti alle forze di polizia schierate contro di loro. Persone che non avevano mai protestato in tutta la loro vita; persino molti degli ex elettori di Lukašenko, riempiono oggi le file dei dimostranti. Per molti di loro il silenzio pesava come una ammissione di colpevolezza, gettava ombra sul futuro dei loro figli e sulla propria dignità. Stare a guardare implica complicità con un governo oppressivo e violento, una volta di troppo.
Il movimento di protesta in Bielorussia ha messo in scenauna delle più grandi manifestazioni antigovernative della sua storia, mobilitando disparati gruppi sociali, tra cui l’intellighenzia, la classe operaia, gli studenti, i pensionati e persino i disabili.  Il paese intero partecipa a questa “rivoluzione di velluto”. È solo questione di tempo, dicono, e il regime cadrà e tutto questo ne sarà valso la pena.

[Analysis] Is A Political Transition On The Horizon For Thailand?,"The political turmoil happening inThailandhas accompanied the news for the whole of 2020. Butwhat is happening in Thailand?Understanding the sociopolitical dynamics of the Thai nation is extremely complicated, as its history is characterized by intense and frequent political shocks that have left space for confusion and little opportunity for the growth of this country.
Thailand, a Southeast Asian unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy, is one of the many remaining developing countries in the world where the military still holds great political power. Its “popular constitution”, also referred to as the “people’s constitution” was promulgated in 1997 and was considered a landmark for its democratic articles and the public participation involved in its drafting. This constitution, however, was later abrogated, and its successor was equally annulled due to the multiple coups that succeeded in the 2000s, undermining democracy and the rights of the Thai people.
Thailand’s volatile politicshave continuously divided public opinion on domestic politics. As shown from the timeline to the side, the amount of attempted and successful coups that have occurred since 1910 have seriously challenge the peaceful transition of Thailand’s society and have created aloop of political dynamicswhich seems difficult to escape.
The rule of theroyal familyhas certainly been a constant, more or less present throughout history, but always problematic when it comes to chances of democratization for Thailand.King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world’s longest-reigning monarch, has reigned Thailand from 1946 to 2016 and was almost regarded as a religious divinity by the majority of its people. Thailand is one of the few countries in the world wherelèse-majestélawsare strict and punish those who insult royalty severely. These have allegedly been used as special and very powerful weapons to silence dissent throughout the years.
As shown from the map, support for different political factions was becoming visible already in 2011, with a significant rise of Democrat supporters. That year, however, thePheu Thai Party, led by Yingluck Shinawatra won the elections. Yingluck, however, was associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, her brother, and reportedly corrupted businessman. She campaigned promising poverty eradication, national unity, and tax reductions only to then fall into corruption just like her brother had done. Criticism sparked due to her self-interested means, which did not turn out to resemble any of the promises made during the election.  In 2013, dissatisfaction escalated in nationwide protests and culminated in the May2014 military coup.
It is clear that divisions were already running in the deepest roots of Thailand’s society and the harsh protests of 2013-2014 would have only led to greater escalations later in history. This means thatthe 2020 protests were predictable. However, what did not seem predictable is the intensity with which they are being carried out.
Images of the current protests in Thailand.Source:The Atlantic.
The rule of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former army chief who seized power in the 2014 coup, seems to have reached its final stage.Thai pro-democracy protests are now spreading across the countryand are being led by the most significant group of Thailand’s society: the youth.  Young Thai people have a key role in shaping the future of Thai politics and seem to bepushing hard for a change. More specifically, they are demanding amendments to the constitution, a new election, the end to the violence towards fellow activists fighting for the rights of Thai people, and the curbing of the royal family’s powers.
Thepro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), led by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, was formed to represent these rights and had already gained extensive support in 2019. However, in February, a loan made by Thanathorn to FFP was deemed illegal and the party wasforcedly dissolved, escalating protests. In an attempt to stop the protests and maintaining order, the Thai government has issued an emergency decree banning gatherings of large groups. Arguably, the ongoingcoronavirus pandemichas provided further justification to repress protests in the hope that negative sentiments spread among people would die down. While at the beginning of 2020, when the pandemic hit, protests did indeed decrease in numbers due to the socio-economic weakening of Thailand, protesters have recently come back stronger than ever. According to historian Thak Chaloemtiarana, this movement not only attracteduniversity studentsbut also younger students who feel the oppression and politicization of their education, suppressing individualism and praising the authoritarian government.
During the Autumn of 2020, these protests have intensified and, with them, arrests have become more common. According toAl Jazeera, only in October 2020, over 21 activists from the young movement were arrested. It is clear, therefore, these year-long protests areunlikely to stopas the youth is determined and certain about the demands made to the government. The three-finger salute shown on multiple photographs, has become the symbol of this movement. From the gallery of images published on The Atlantic and reported above, a particular photo shows Queen Suthida visibly worried gazing at protests from inside the royal motorcade.
Below, an interview withThanathorn Juangroongruangkit, shows the willingness of the former Future Forward Party to remain an active part of lives of Thailand’s youth, maintaining its goals as a social movement, if not allowed as political party.
The current political unrest in Thailand is said to have created agenerational divideand have divided the population according to age groups. This has never been the case in previous conflicts and, currently, different ideas are creating clashes inside family contexts too.
“Most of them support this government, but young people have opposite ideas.”
A story of a law student reported by the BBC, entitled “My father is blinded by his love for the monarchy” explains the generational divide enlarged by politics. Possibly, the older Thai generations not only shared support for the monarchy but have also seen protests fail in the past. Older people in Thailand have lived through violence, coups, and sudden political changes which have never given greater voice to the Thai population itself but instead have maintained or evenaugmented the power of the military and royal family. Older Thais do not believe in the current protests and may have fear for the future of their children and grandchildren participating in this movement. But, if not them, who is ever going to fight for political changes in Thailand? Questioning the past is legitimate and will be a major driver of change for the current generation of protesters.","January 21, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-is-a-political-transition-on-the-horizon-for-thailand/,The New Global Order,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
What Joe Biden’s Election Means For US Asylum and Migration Policy,"President-electJoe Bidenwill inherit from the Trump administration a limping immigration system, whichseparates childrenfrom their families and keeps migrantsstranded in Mexicowhile they await their asylum decisions. Bidenhas pledgeda sweeping overhaul of Trump’s restrictionist agenda, both domestically and internationally, but he might face many challenges along the way.
Restricting access to protection and downgrading asylum seekers’ rights in order to deter arrivals to the US has been a trademark of the Trump administration. Since 2018, Trump has graduallynarrowedthe criteria for asylum eligibility and barred people from applying for protection in the US if they did not already have a negative asylum application in one of their transit countries.
At the same time, the so-called “family separation” and “remain in Mexico” policies have, respectively, separated over 5,000 children from their accompanying adults – referred for criminal prosecution for entering the US illegally – and leftover 68,000 peoplein dangerous conditions in Mexico while they awaited the court’s verdict, which has been positive in less than 0.1% of the cases.
On the other hand, asylum seekers awaiting their asylum decisions in the US have seen their rights restricted, especially during the pandemic period. In mid-2020, for instance, Trumplimited work permitsfor asylum seekers andremoved the 30-day deadlinefor the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to authorise employment for asylum seekers, two measures which make it difficult for people to support themselves while they await the court’s verdict.
The measures which Biden has promised to take in order to reverse the country’s restrictive turn in immigration policy include:
The most visible trace of Trump’s restrictionist agenda, however, can be found at theUS-Mexico border. According tofiguresfrom October 2020, the Trump administration hasreinforced the pre-existing 654-mile (just over 1,000km) border barrierand built an additional 15-mile (24km) fence, meaning the border barrier now covers a total of 669 miles (1,076km).
The wall is part of a$15-billion planto build a barrier along the border’s entire 2000-mile (around 3,000km) length, which was the flagship of Trump’s 2016 election campaign. To secure funding for the wall in 2019, Trump decided to bypass Congress by declaring border control a national emergency and appropriating around $10 billion from the Department of Defense.
Biden has promised to end the “constitutionally dubious” national emergency that makes use of defence funding to build the border wall. He plans instead to direct national resources to screening infrastructures and “smart border enforcement” technologies. These efforts would be complemented by increased cross-agency cooperation with Mexico and Canada.
Under Trump’s nationalistic agenda, migration management has been seen as a matter of national sovereignty to be dealt with unilaterally. In 2018, for example, the US refused to commit to theGlobal Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), an international agreement approved by 152 countries and negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations to tackle multiple aspects of migration globally. The GCM, from theUS’s perspective, was “inconsistent with US immigration and refugee policies and the Trump administration’s immigration principles”.
Regionally, Trump used the threat of tariffs to coerce countries in the immediate neighbourhood of the US to cooperate on migration control. In 2019, this strategy made it possible to sign anagreementwith Mexico which reinforced the Remain in Mexico policy and bound the Mexican government to step up controls at its southern border with Guatemala. Likewise, from July to September 2019,El Salvador, Guatemala, and Hondurassigned bilateral agreements where they committed to accept some asylum seekers sent back from the US.
Biden plans to step up the US’s involvement in global migration management and restore friendly relations with neighbouring countries. He will likely increase resettlement pledges, which have reached a historical low under the Trump administration, and, according tosome experts, join the GCM. At the regional level, heintendsto restore friendly relations with neighbouring countries and end Trump’s bilateral agreements. In short, Biden can be expected to strike a fair balance between migration control and humanitarian policies.
Despite all of its good intentions, the Biden administration’s ability to pass swift reforms will depend on several factors, such as the balance of power in Congress. Asmany commentatorspoint out, if Republicans retain their majority in the Senate, they will likely block most of Biden’s proposed reforms. A further obstacle to immigration reforms is the fact that the Biden administration willprioritiseother policy areas, most notably recovery from theCOVID-19 pandemic, climate, trade, and foreign policy.
Given the far-reaching overhaul that the country’s immigration system needs and the many obstacles, it seems likely that a good number of Trump’s policies will continue to determine the fate of people seeking refuge and safety in the US in the coming years.
As we think about ways for the US to regain its leading role in the global refugee regime and build a humane domestic immigration system, it is worth considering a few questions:

Iran In Power Struggle After Assassination of Top Nuclear Scientist,"Theassassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadehbrought all eyes back to Iran as world powers await its retaliatory move. Fakhrizadeh led Iran’s Organisation for Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), otherwise regarded as Iran’s nuclear weapons program, which the scientist was seen as the main propeller of for decades. Much concern has surrounded Iran’s nuclear capability, despite the state’s assurance that the program is entirely peaceful.
Following decades of global sanctions and failed negotiations designed to impede Iran’s nuclear program, a landmark 2015 deal was implemented to ease international tensions with the state and quell its nuclear proliferation. TheIran Nuclear Deal, negotiated with France, Germany, China, Russia, the US and UK, promised to lift preliminary sanctions on the condition that Iran would limit its nuclear capability and allow outsider monitoring. However, in 2018,US President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement, deeming it inadequate, and reverted to sanctioning Iran. This move re-ignited the nuclear diplomacy struggle between Iran and the US, as well as Iran and the rest of the world, as Iran reverted to expanding its nuclear capability.
Promising‘harsh revenge’against those responsible for Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, Iranian officials believe Israeland Iranian opposition group Mujahideen-e Khalq were behind the attack. Although, considering Iran’s contentious relationship with both the US and Saudi Arabia, their involvement is also not out of the question. The incoming Biden presidency in the US, however, is potentially granting Iran an upper hand in the continuing regional and international power struggle concerning its nuclear program.
Israel continues to deny its involvement in Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, but Iran maintains its conviction that it was an Israeli attack. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly vowed that Iran’s nuclear program is dangerous and hasopposed the 2015 nuclear dealsince its inception. Netanyahu has therefore avidly supported Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the deal and subsequent sanctioning of Iran – a foreign policy move which Joe Biden promises to overturn once inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States. Israel would therefore have two primary motives to enact such an attack: disturb the progression of Iran’s nuclear program, at least in the short term, and disturb prospects for a re-negotiation between Biden and President Rouhani, given the timing of the attack. Killing Fakhrizadeh has the potential to significantly impact future Iranian engagement with Joe Biden because of the US’ allyship with Israel; the Western partner has consistently supported Israel’s foreign policy in the region.
A distrust of the US would also stem from the fact that Trump, like Netanyahu, has denounced Iran’s nuclear program, along with its missile program, and the supplementary nuclear deal. Trump reverted to sanctioning the Iranian regime, crippling the country’s economy. The US’ involvement in further plans to de-stabilize Iran is therefore also considered, especially considering Trump’s earlier executive order toassassinate Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020. So, as his presidency comes to an end, this assistance to Israel presents itself as a final opportunity for Donald Trump to further dismantle US-Iran relations and diminish prospects for future negotiations between Biden and Rouhani.
Despite presenting a more cooperative approach to Iran, Joe Biden, like Trump, has expressed disapproval of Iran attaining nuclear weapons. However, unlike Trump, he stands firmly by the belief that reviving the 2015 nuclear deal is an effective avenue to limit Iran’s nuclear capability and maintain peaceful relations. The President elect has promised to lift sanctions against Iran once he and Rouhani re-negotiate the nuclear deal and Iran will demonstrate full compliance.Biden’s conditionsfor re-instating the deal include the set up of further negotiations to extend the duration of restrictions on Iran’s production of fissile material, address Iran’s ballistic missile program, and scrutinize Iran on its activities across the Middle East via proxy groups.
Iran’s President has already rejected Biden’s conditions, declaring Iran will only accept the nuclear deal in its original form. Rouhani noted how the additional terms were discussed in the drafting of the original deal and were rejected then too. Iran’s fixed, non-negotiable position and Biden’s determination to extend the terms of the deal place the two administrations at a crossroads, limiting the scope of success for a new deal.
While there is still space for compromise, the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh is most likely fuelling Iran’s resolve on the nuclear deal. The assassination was an unlawful attack against the nuclear program in question, with the suspected perpetrator being an ally of the US. Despite needing the sanctions placed upon it to end, Iran is in a position of bargaining power by requiring Biden to prove he can be trusted in keeping the original terms of the deal. This is especially important for Iran consideringBiden has equally promisedto continue to assist Israel in defending itself against Iran. The incoming US President has admitted it will be hard to tell how much the assassination will complicate his upcoming engagements with Iran.  Rouhani’s response to his proposed terms indicates he will currently have little success achieving his objectives. Iran is therefore in a position to assert its own needs, which Biden may ultimately be forced to agree with due to his own determination to reach an agreement.Rouhani’s disclosurethat a previous attempt to extend the terms of the deal by the Obama administration also failed suggests this is will end in a similar scenario.
If Donald Trump had been re-elected for a second term of the US Presidency, the US and Israel would be in a more powerful position as Trump would most likely sustain sanctions, which Iran would continue to suffer the economic consequences of. However, knowing that Biden is willing to lift sanctions places Iran in a better position to make its own demands.
Saudi Arabia’s relations with Iran are also significant amid the assassination. Although the Kingdom has its separate conflicts with Iran, not exclusively concerning Iran’s nuclear program, it became affiliated with Fakhrizadeh’s killing oncereports resurfaced of a meetingbetween Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, Benjamin Netanyahu, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The meeting took place on 22nd November, before the 27th November assassination, in Neom. While Israeli officials confirmed the meeting between all three parties, Saudi officials denied the Prince met with Netanyahu, along withdenying involvement in the attackagainst Iran’s nuclear scientist. Although it remains in conversations surrounding Mohsen Fakhrizadeh’s assassination,  Saudi Arabia has voiced preference for the existence of a nuclear deal and hasdemanded that it be consulted, along with other Gulf states, on the terms of a revised deal.
Iran and Saudi Arabia have shared a longstanding, primarily proxy, conflict. The most recent majorattack took place in September 2019, when Houthi rebels in Yemen targeted Aramco facilities in Jeddah, severely disrupting Saudi oil output. Saudi officials maintain the attack was sponsored by Iran, because of its alignment with Houthis. A contentious relationship and regional proximity to Iran suggests Saudi Arabia would need Iranian compliance on a deal that would cap the Islamic Republic’s nuclear capabilities and stabilize regional tensions. In supporting the return of a nuclear deal, Saudi Arabia demonstrates a more multilateral approach than Israel, for example, by stressing the need for regional and international cooperation on a solution. Given the disruption Fakhrizadeh’s attack has caused to the prospect of re-instating a new nuclear agreement soon, Saudi Arabia would be acting against its own national interest if it had played a role.
As with the US, Iran has also gained a position of bargaining power with Saudi Arabia. Recognising that Saudi Arabia favours the existence of a nuclear deal gives Iran an advantage to determine the terms of such a deal as it is aware regional and international players are also better off with the deal in place.Iran has also previously noted Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to develop a nuclear weapons program. It may use this again as a method to attain Saudi compliance with its desired terms. Whatever Iran sets in place would pre-determine what a a future nuclear deal may look like for a Saudi Arabian nuclear program. Granting Iran a second opportunity to resist sanctions in favour of a deal would set up a similar path for Saudi Arabia in the future.

[Analysis] Can Google Trends be Used for Political Polling?,"Google Trends is believed to help predict everything from market movements to the most popular Halloween costumes, but what happens if we try to predict political elections with it?
Google Trends is a handy marketing tool that was launched over 14 years ago for measuring the popularity of search queries in Google’s search engine across the globe. It aged well, and managed to attract a varied pool of devotees, that includes marketers, journalists and scientists who turn to it whenever they struggle to decipher human psyche – in other words, always when on duty.
Among its die-hard practitioners isSeth Stephens-Davidowitz, a scientist whose PhD thesis was based on data from Google Trends, and who was among the first to position the tool as an alternative to traditional sociological research, which he thinks often fails to quantify human behaviours with precision. Davidowitz believes the conditions under which people search on Google – most likely on their private devices, and alone – are more suited for gathering real opinions, concerns, and sentiments of people, than traditional surveys.
He famously argued his point, in an NewYork Times articlein which he demonstrated that racial aversion played a huge role in the presidential election in the United States in 2009 and that Barack Obama, as a future president had to overcome far more adversity than anyone had expected or any election poll at the time had revealed.
He achieved that by creating a map of racially charged states using Google searches that included the word “n****r” and measured how popular such searches were across the country. The scale from the map was later correlated with the final percentage of votes Barack Obama received in each state.Controlled for a strong Democratic support in 2008, and historic data on support for John Kerry in 2004, Davidowitz also estimated the votes Obama should have got– for example he estimated Obama to control about57% of the vote in Denver and in Wheeling whereas in reality, his victory in  those two cities was much smaller – he only received 48% of the vote there.
For Davidowitz, it was clear that something was missing from the estimates. Something that was holding Obama’s popularity score at much lower rate than the one he predicted for him. He traced it back to a racial prejudice, for which evidence was piling up from Google Searches made in Colorado and Ohio. Against the claims that were popular at the time, Davidowitz went to show that prejudice was still a thing in a modern America. His NYT article made waves, and became one of the first uses of Google Trends, not so much to predict but to contradict official pooling.
A slightly different use of Google Trends to comment on the exercise of the democratic right to vote followedthe 2016 referendum on EU membership(Brexit) in the UK. In addition to reports of declines of stock prices, the British media discussed themost popular search termson Google that day, including the question “what’s the EU” which, for some, signaled indifference and a lack of recognition of the seriousness of the situation among voters.
This inherently selective use of Google data to comment on post-referendum results, as opposed to Davidowitz’s more detailed research, was perhaps anecdotal and instead fed into sensationionalism at the time. Nevertheless, it did help to create a narrative about defrauded citizens who did not know what they voted for when they voted to leave the European Union – the narrative that later became the basis for calls for a second referendum.
If people’s true feelings can be measured with a tool with near-seismographic capabilities, why not use it before the elections and not after them?Among the others who used Google Trends data to measure a candidate’s public popularity before the elections was Tom Cochran – a CEO of a public relations firm called 720 strategies that conducted a Google Trends survey in response toPete Buttgieg’s risein popularity in November 2019 Iowa’s Poll, just before the 2020 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses. A noteworthy event for a country where caucuses are deemed as an indication of how a presidential candidate will later perform in primaries.
Cochran used Google Trends to see how support for Democratic candidates has changed over time, comparing Google search data for Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren,Joe Biden, andBernie Sandersover three different timeframes (last 12 months, last 30 days and the last 7 days). He then explained how candidates dominate Google through events (favorable or not) related to apparent spikes in popularity. Lastly, Cochran compared his own results with national polls to see whether polls, such as the one in Iowa really did matter.
As of November 2019, indeed the intent demonstrated through Google searches seemed to lined up closely with official polling data. The research may not have allowed Cochran to predict who would ultimately become the Democrat candidate inthe 2020 U.S. presidential election.However, it allowed him to show that the tool, contrary to an explicit refusal by Google, could be used, if responsibly, for political polling.
Data scientists like to say that working with tempting but messy data is one of the great sins of data analysis. Incomplete data and weak proxies often lead to far-reaching and effectively wrong conclusions, that can be ruinous to the most inventive theories.
In a recent interview on using Google Trends to study the spread of Covid-19,Davidowitzreferred to one such unsuccessful project in which Jeremy Ginsberg (known from his 2008 paperOn Detecting Flu Using Google Queries) attempted to re-apply the model to map the US H1N1 swine flu epidemic.While his initial modeling to predict flu outbreaks was lauded for its accuracy, it did not produce similar results for swine flu, as it indicated an extraordinary number of cases among Americans, while actual levels were found to be much lower.
The predictions from Ginsberg’s modelling were skewed not by dishonest pollsters, as in traditional surveys, but by users’ fears and curiosity that manifested itself in searches which rose to levels greater than the actual disease.
If Google Trends data were to be used for predicting politics, it wouldn’t be exempt from similar problems.“Donald Trump”could be a groundbreaking search, not because people favour him more than John Biden, but perhaps because they want to learn more about his recent commentary or a tweet (provided Jack Dorsey lifts his ban).
For this reason, traditional researchers may find Google’s search intent to be obscured and unclear, disqualifying it as a reliable data source. But others will argue that politics is nothing like science:politics is about momentum. Cochran’s findings, in which the survey data were compared with data from Google Trends, could be helpful here, as they suggest that the intent behind Google searches shouldn’t be much of a problem, at least not on the highly polarized political scene like the one in the US.
The recent presidential election in Poland can be a good example. It was widely predicted that the election was on the brink of a knife with the incumbent Andrzej Duda (an ally of the ruling, right-wing party PiS) in a desperate need to defend his title against the liberal center-right president of Warsaw – Rafał Trzaskowski. After two rounds of voting, the incumbent remained in office, which was called by the BBC “the smallest Polish presidential victory since 1989”.
I analysed Google Trends to see if there was anything interesting that would help me understand voters behavior and filter out campaign moments that were decisive for Duda’s victory.
From a quick look at the chart  one thing is obvious: the interest in Trzaskowski (light blue line) was strangely delayed, as if the man was almost absent from the top of Polish interests until mid-May. Indeed, Trzaskowski got involved late, taking over on May 15 from former PO candidate Kidawa Błońska (the only female candidate).
Even though he was a mayor of Warsaw for almost two years at the time, interest in Trzaskowski was relatively low or certainly not as great as in the other key candidates at the start of the race. This is not a groundbreaking data point, but important when we consider that one of his opponents, Szymon Hołownia (light green), a former journalist and independent candidate who was little known to the public before the race, has attracted an enormous attention and grew in popularity in Google about a week before there were any noticeable interest in Trzaskowski.
From the day of announcing Trzaskowski’s candidacy, he followed an almost similar trajectory as Duda, with a rather short-lived domination over the incumbent. You may wonder, were these two imitating each other so well that they achieved similar trending results? Probably not, but most likely their names were searched together.
In his research using Google Trends election data, Davidowitz made an interesting discovery – a large percentage of electoral searches in polarized countries typically list both candidates.
However, this is not necessarily a sign of support, and certainly not to the person whose name is in a second place, as people are more likely to include the name of the candidate they support first. For example, during the 2016 election, more than a quarter of searches for “Clinton” (second place in a query string) also included “Trump”(first place in a query string). The almost identical trajectory for “Andrzej Duda” and “Rafał Trzaskowski” may suggest that many of these searches included the names of both candidates and it took Trzaskowski about a week to get searched separately on Google, which is a serious drawback for anyone who is a week late in running for presidency.
The mayor’s visible dominance over the remaining candidates, with the greatest difference of interests between him and the incumbent, was visible around the 4th of July. However, unlike competitors, the increase in interest in his candidacy was not motivated by a public speech or announcements of the flagship program, but only because on that day Trzaskowski was collecting signatures that must be registered in Poland in order to run in eletions. Yes, it was a signal of an improving support, but perhaps it also revealed that a fraction of Poles were ready to vote out of anger.
Another similar increase in interest occurred a few days before the first polls were opened on June 28, but once again his name was found next to another participant, far-right Polish politician Kamil Bosak, who published his version of the economic recovery plan after the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, people have been googling the mayor less frequently than Andrzej Duda, but no less than Kamil Bosak, although in the end the far-right politician obtained less than 7% of the vote. Trzaskowski was getting noticed, but not as much or not as quickly as it was needed to win the election.
From June onwards, the interest in his main opponent, reflected in Google searches, slowly increased. This is due to Duda’s election strategy to remain visible to national and international media through radical speeches and actions such as his infamous public performance in Brzeg, southwestern Poland, where he called the promotion of LGBT rights an “ideology” similar to communism. The speech was widely covered in domestic and foreign media – as planned. At the end of June, Duda once again found himself in the spotlight during his hasty visit to the White House, which was interpreted by the liberal media as a pretext for additional publicity, that lead to a defense cooperation agreement unfavourable for Poland.
In the eyes of his supporters however, this was seen as a confirmation of Poland’s strongest ties with Washington in years. Such actions, whether deplorable or not, show that Duda has certainly been advised how to revive his campaign and strengthen his image of a politician who is willing to cooperate with the West, but also distance himself from the fruits of Western liberalism.
It would now be tempting to assume that in a country with balanced political influence, a righ wing government that openly declares hostility to sexual minorities must infuriate the left, which in turn will translate to greater support for the Polish Left. However, according to Google Trends, this never happened. The search for the first openly homosexual legislator in Poland, who was the only left-wing candidate in the presidential election, grew only proportionally compared to the interests in other candidates, and nevertheless remained at a very low level.  Except for one spike of interest here and there, the lack of seaches for Robert Biedroń confirms speculations about a large part of Polish society, that it is not ready for a left-wing government and a leader alike. This is another interesting, sociliological data point that would be missed in regular polls.
Already at the very beginning of the presidential elections in Poland, it was clear that it would be a tough competition, both for the candidates and for Poles who desperately counted on a change of guard. For this reason, it would be brutal to leave readers with the conclusion that such warning signals as minimal interest in Robert Biedroń, a man whose opinion could be of importance to Duda’s sermons in Brzeg, or the lack of interest in Trzaskowski’s figure earlier in the elections provided more information than any political polls of the time.
Instead, consider the obvious benefits of using this method to measure the effectiveness of political commitment, and how we can tell if the public is sympathetic to certain programs, if at all. It can also be of great benefit to the candidates themselves as they can measure their wins and flaps in real time. Would Trzaskowski be more involved if he knew he was losing it to the incumbent because of his radical public appearances? Probably.
The above insights are just an introduction to the vast knowledge that can be learned from Google Trends. Rather than relying on the names of the candidates, we could also look at specific keywords that can tell us much more about the people who perform these searches, such as what part of the country they come from and whether they have any other associations with the candidates. But that may be a topic for another analysis.","January 26, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-can-google-trends-be-used-for-political-polling/,Kamila Koronska,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
India Farmers’ Protests: “A Human Movement”,"At the end of September 2020, the Indian Government passedthree agricultural billsthat will transform the country’s farming system. The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Act, Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and Essential Commodities Act have been introduced as initiatives to increase growth in India’s agricultural sector and benefit the country’s farmers.
Since the bills were ratified, however, millions in India kickstarted a protest demanding their reversal, declaring these bills will harm farmers rather than help them. This protest has since surpassed India’s borders and spread worldwide, becoming one of the largest social movements in history.
Kiran Dulay is a Punjabi Canadian/British Sikh living in the UK. With her family having originated in India, and within its farming industry, Kiran is close to the movement that calls for the protection of India’s farmers. In this interview, Kiran explains the cause of the movement, details actions taken by her family, as well as an entire community, and provides an international perspective, while also noting where religion fits into it all.
“These bills are a massive threat to farmers, their land, their produce, their business. It threatens their lives, their future, their children’s lives; it’s not just a current problem”, Kiran begins, explaining the impact this legislation will have on Indian farmers. “The main movement has been from Punjab to Delhi, because most of the farmers protesting are from there, but it has brought in farmers from other states. This affects farmers in Pakistan too, not just Sikh Punjabi farmers.” She talks me through each bill and what exactly it will entail.
The first bill promotes inter-state trade, promising lower transport costs. Kiran explains India does not have the infrastructure to support this, meaning the transport of goods will, in fact, be expensive. The bill also aims to expand the market for farmers, enabling them to trade outside of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and with large companies, assuring greater competition and lower prices.
Kiran explains that this will lead to thecollapse of the current Minimum Support Price (MSP), which prevents farmers from being paid low prices; “At the beginning, private buyers will pay higher than the current market, so farmers will sell to them, but then the current system will no longer be needed and MSP will not exist along with it. Private buyers will realise they have no-one to compete with for price and will drop their prices, lower than the MSP. Realistically, farmers will not be able to afford this and it could lead them into poverty.”
This bill intends to provide more opportunities for farmers to contract their produce to buyers, such as large retailers and agri-business firms, on pre-agreed prices. “This will only benefit farmers which own a lot of land. A high percentage of farmers own very little land, so there is a bigger gap in contracting opportunities for small farmers.”
Finally, the Essential Commodities Act removes certain commodities otherwise deemed as essential from the list of essential commodities. These include products like potatoes, onions and oilseeds. This bill therefore removes limits on stocks of what would be deemed essential products, meaning there will be no cap on the amount of stock large companies can retain. “This allows them to dominate the market by buying and storing limited products. It leaves little space for smaller farmers to sell their own crops.”
All three bills remove protections for farmers against private buyers; “Without this protection, big corporations will gain a large amount of power over poorer farmers.”
Having discussed the implications of these bills, I ask Kiran why there is the obligation, felt by her family, as well as an entire community, to demonstrate against this new legislation. “Our ancestors come from farming. If they did not move out of India, we would still be affected by this. We still have family in India whose main job is farming. But it’s not just about where we come from. As a human, you should help the situation; any injustices should be talked about by humans.”Kiran explains the cause for protesting through the movement’s popular slogan ‘No farmers, no food’: “Those are the people who provide us with food. It is our job to make their voices heard; they should not be left alone to do that. Even if people think it does not affect them, it does. If you add spices to your food: 70% of the world’s spices from India. If you use medicine: India is the third largest producer of pharmaceuticals in the world. If you consume any Indian imports, such as basmati rice, wheat, cane sugar, black tea, coffee, onions, oats, berries, it affects you.”
Kiran stresses this peaceful protest aims toraise awareness and change these bills, “for the Indian government to realise that, globally, no one’s going to stop talking about it. Without anyone talking about it or putting it forward, it is not getting the voice it deserves.” And to the people who say it’s not their problem: “You should care about humanity. Stop bringing up the differences between countries and just come together as a collective for human rights.”
As part of her university’s Sikh Society, Kiran is participating in discussions and debates on the topic, to spread information and raise awareness. “Students in Sikh societies across all universities are talking about this and finding ways to promote it.” Her family in California and Vancouver have also been helping to organise demonstrations, protesting to the Indian High Commission in each location. The same is done by family and friends across the UK.
“As a community, everyone is supporting each other”, even through minor acts to assist the protest; “people are in standstills in their cars for many hours, so my family are also handing out food and posters to protestors.”
Kiran is based in the UK, where the protest has gradually expanded too. “I think it is picking up here because of the young generation. They have shared it the most online.Without social media we would not have been able to come together to raise this awareness. It was not being covered by the media.”
We remain on the topic of media and the way the framing of the protest affects attitudes to the cause. “There is very little media coverage, or it is being covered in a negative way.” Kiran cites the example of responses to Birmingham’s protest, which the media largely reported as an inconvenience to local businesses, despite a number of business owners in the area voicing their support. “It has been negatively manipulated in the media by focusing on police trying to control the situation,COVID(which did not stop protests before, and everyone is being safe), or how ‘inconvenient’ it was. People need to understand how inconvenient it is for these farmers. It is a collective human rights problem, not just one country’s problem.”
We then reflect on the UK’s response to the movement, as an international voice.36 UK MPs have written a letter to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, pleading him to raise the matter with Delhi. However, the current response has been limited to supporting the Indian population’s right to protest, although cautious of any violence that may erupt from such protests. The Foreign Secretary has remained firm in keeping the UK out of matters concerning the Indian government.
“The UK can do a lot better to promote the cause. There have not been any meaningful comments on the protest from the Prime Minister.” She brings upBoris Johnson‘s confusion of the matter in the House of Commons when he referred to the issues between India and Pakistan, instead of the protest; “he did not know what he was talking about.”
On the other hand, Kiran has praised the Canadian Government: “The Prime Minister’s comments have been positive, expressing solidarity. The national farmers unions have talked about it as well, and there has been widespread media coverage.” She notes that she wants to see this response from the UK as well; “they should put forward a more positive viewpoint, put out a statement to support the protestors and support the cause. The Prime Minister of India needs to change the bills. If, internationally, everyone comes together, he is bound to change it. He cares about his international reputation.”
Is this why the protest should be international despite the issue being domestic?“Without the support of other countries, how can one country change? They need an international movement for this change. If countries continue to take a global stand for the cause and against the unjust violence protestors are facing, India will be forced to listen and abide by the constitutional rights of freedom of speech, expression and assembly.”
Referring to the violent response protestors have faced by the Indian police and army, Kiran fearsthis protest may become even more violent, despite the international attention it has received. “The Indian government has suppressed farmers and Sikhs in the past, so there is a chance the Prime Minister may order the army to shoot at protestors.” She claims international attention has not been enough to prevent repression; “protestors are still being treated badly, some are dying, are beaten, tear gassed”.
Kiran also notes the mental effects of the farmers’ fight. “The protest itself is draining, but they would rather go through that, they would rather die for the cause, than have future generations go through poverty and distress because of this. It is obvious to the farmers that this law will destroy their livelihoods.” It is because of this why a number of farmers have already committed suicide; “They can’t deal with the fact that this is going to happen to their livelihood and their future generations.”
The Indian farmers’ movement is regarded as one of the largest social movements in history, taking place within the same year as another global movement,Black Lives Matter, as well as other significant movements, such as#EndSARS protests in Nigeriaandanti-government protests in Belarus. It is also the year of COVID. We discuss the prevalent themes of fighting for lives, for rights, for livelihoods in 2020.
When asked whether this context makes the Indian farmers’ protests even more significant, Kiran added that “this year has been a year of fighting against injustice. These movements share common interests, which is a big driver.” However, Kiran also speaks on the hesitancies she has in comparing this movement to ones like Black Lives Matter. “This movement has not reached the same level as BLM. I think a lot of people jumped on BLM as it was trending. With this, not enough people are putting effort into venturing out and seeing what the cause is about. If everyone who has supported similar movements in the past came together, this would be much larger.”
Speaking of previous protest movements and their trajectories, the issue of dilution was also raised. As the movement grows outside of India, is it worrying the cause may become so big that it will be ever-present, making it easier to adjust to and ignore? While considering it a possibility, Kiran concludes:
“As a community, I don’t see people stopping before this change is made.”
If there is no risk of dilution,doubts could linger whether protests may be misdirected. The attendance of pro-Khalistan groups at protests has been viewed as distracting from the cause to promote an anti-Indian agenda instead. However, the sentiment among Kiran and her family is simple:the protest is not being misdirected. “The ultimate purpose of the movement is to repeal the three bills, but we also have to understand people’s psyche, the play between their cultural and religious being, and their place in the country of India.” Kiran’s brother-in-law, Gurvinder Singh, speaks on this issue specifically, “People continue this dialogue when they do not feel heard or free in their country. The hesitancy of the government to repeal these bills shows that it prioritizes corporations and financial investment over people’s wellbeing, which further perpetuates the idea that farmers are treated as second class citizens in their own country.”
Finally, the topic of religion, and where it fits into a protest movement for farmers, was discussed. “So many Sikhs are protesting because most of the farmers in Punjab and India are Sikhs.” While heritage is a large contributing factor to the role of religious values in the movement, political history also plays a big part: “To a certain extent, it is based on previous things that have happened to Sikhs, things they do not want happening to them again.” Kiran refers to the1984 Sikh Massacre, during which the Indian National Congress organised riots against Sikhs in the country. With religious roots, values, and lessons from history, Kiran’s community is taught “if there is any injustice, you need to put your voice forward and try to change it. Our religion drives us to make this better. Muslims and Hindus are also supporting it.”
Kiran concludes by stating that, ultimately, common humanitarian values drive the cause:
This is a human movement.

Sudan: Russia’s New Pawn On The Chessboard,"On November 16, 2020,Russian President VladimirPutinsigned an agreement to set up a naval base on the Red Sea coast inSudan. Given the strategic geographical position of Sudan,Russiahas more to gain than to lose. With thisdeal, the base will be used as a ‘supply and maintenance base for Russian warships’, where it can ‘accommodate up to four warships simultaneously, including nuclear-powered vessels, and a garrison of up to 300 military and civilian personnel’.
The naval base is set to be used for25 yearsand Russia will be allowed toimport weapons and military suppliesthrough the airports and ports in Sudanwithout any control by the local authorities. On the other side, Russia will install in Sudan ‘defense systems’ that the country will be able to use and will assist with the ‘Sudanese navy for search and rescue or ‘anti-sabotage’ missions’.
Given the nature of the agreement and geographical area, the new deal is a new way for Russia to establish itself as a major player in theRed Sea.
Before its collapse in 1991, theSoviet Unionhad during the Cold War multiple bases inEthiopia,SomaliaandYemen. As such, it seems that President Putin has been attempting (and succeeding) in restoring its power and presence outside of Russia. In order to gain more access and power in the Mediterranean region, Russia played a prominent role inSyriain 2015, when it began to help President Assad in stopping an insurgency. As such, the Syrian regime granted Russia’s demand to establish a base at the port ofTartus(Syria) and at the air base of Khmeimim in 2017. Russia could use thenaval basefor ‘warships with greater capacity or sustained and more distant operations in the Mediterranean Sea’ and the air base for ‘dozens of combat aircraft’, as well as ‘the long-range S-400 air defense system’.
In the same year, Russia signed anagreementwithEgyptto use air bases for its own combat aircrafts. In 2019, Russia and Egypt participated in a joint military training exercise of 13 days called ‘Arrow of Friendship 1’.
While playing an important role in the Mediterranean Sea, Russia has always kept an eye on the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea as well. The country’s talks withYemenin 2008, although they stopped due to the instability after the fall of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2012, are an example. In 2014, Russia held talks with the Republic ofDjibouti, although the Djibouti government disagreed with the negotiations following the US’ constant pressure. Lastly, Russian officials began negotiating withEritreain 2018, but the consultation failed. Consequently, Russia turned toSudanand former President Omar al-Bashir, and engaged in negotiations, resulting in the establishment of the naval base in the cityPort Sudan.
Russia seems to gain more than to lose with these negotiations due toseveral reasons, even when one considers the low quality of the infrastructure of the port in Sudan.
Firstly, due to its geographical proximity, Russia can use the port in Sudan ‘as a launchpad forexpanded power projection on the Mediterranean Sea‘. It improves its access to trade through the Suez Canal, as well as ‘alleviat[ing] the resupply commitments assumed by Tartus’, thus changing from a resupply establishment to a multi-function naval base. Secondly, the geographical position to the Red Sea plays a strategic and influential role in Russia’s plans. In fact, the base in Sudan would be easily used as ‘a bulwark against maritime security threats in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean‘. According to the Russian naval doctrine, there are a lot of piracy acts taking place in the Indian Ocean and in the Red Sea. The latter represents potential disruptions against Russia’s interests, its welfare, and its nationals. In 2008, the Russian warship Neustrashimy collaborated with the British HMS Cumberland in the Gulf of Aden to resist against Somali pirates; while in 2010, the pirates hijacked the Russian tanker MV Moscow University in the Gulf of Aden. In addition to that, piracy is a big threat and plays an important role in the field of oil, as Russia works with Saudi Arabia in order to secure and steady the oil prices through OPEC+ and the disruption of the transit of 4.7 million oil barrels via the Bab El-Mandeb Strait would destabilise the prices.
As such, even though the US and China have in the past actively fought piracy and secured the areas, Russia can from now on play a more active role in the fight. Thirdly, the naval base in Sudan can be used logistically to secure its investments in the country andreinforce its collaboration with Khartoum. In fact, Russia has been providing more than 80% of Sudan’s armament for more than 17 years and the Russian paramilitary Wagner Group has been on Sudan’s grounds for already 2 years with the objective to protect and secure gold mines in Sudan, although it is illegal under Russian law. Nevertheless, establishing a Russian presence in the Sudanese port’s facility will legally authorize the presence of military groups. As such, this would ‘help Russia augment the security of its gold mining assets and transit from a transactional relationship with Sudan based on arms sales to a more comprehensive security partnership’.
Russia is not the only one that has an influence and a base in the Red Sea and its presence threatens the other rival political countries and has consequences in the current geopolitical status quo.Turkeyis one of the players in this geopolitical arena. Before 2019, when President Omar al-Bashir was deposed in a coup d’état, Ankara and Khartoum had good relations. The agreement that led to Turkey’s reconstruction of theSuakin Island, viewed by many as historically crucial, is an example. Furthermore, the deal itself threatened other neighboring countries, as there were ‘allegations that Turkey was seeking to expand its military foothold in Africa, in the Gulf and the Red Sea’.
Nevertheless, following the overthrow of President al-Bashir, President Erdogan has not yet succeeded in setting up its own naval base. In the meantime, the establishment of a Russian military naval base in Sudan poses a threat to Turkey, given that there is a history of anti-Turkish attitude from Russia. It can firstly be seen in the case of Libya, where Russia sided withGeneral Khalifa Haftar, who is closely linked to countries like Egypt, theUnited Arab EmiratesandSaudi Arabiaas well, all political rivals of Turkey. The Russia naval base in the city of Port Sudan has been declared an ‘anti-Turkish step‘.
The second geopolitical player isChina. China has been focusing for a long time on Africa through the project One Belt, One Road Initiative (OBOR) especially inSudan, where the Sudanese government contributed to China’s 5% oil that they imported, while Chinese companies invested in the improvement of Sudan’s infrastructure. Although Beijing has established a military base in the Republic of Djibouti, the news of Russia’s new naval base in Port Sudan has been well received by theChinese governmentas it is regarded as a ‘sign of Khartoum’s willingness to combat ‘foreign interference’ from the US and France’.
Another prominent player is theUnited States. The US has been, in fact, very influential and powerful in the Horn of Africa and has a military base in the Republic of Djibouti. Since 1993, the US inserted Sudan on the list of state who are sponsoring terrorism, as former President al-Bashir gave shelter to militants of al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. After 27 years, on December 14, 2020,US President Donald Trumpannounced the removal of Sudan from the list, permitting the country to make new economic reforms and receive international investments. Following the announcement, Russia agreed with the Sudanese government to establish the base. Even though the US removed the country from the terrorist list, the establishment of the Russian base poses athreat, as ‘easy access to supplies, ammunition, and facilities for repair and maintenance may embolden Russian ships to harass US warships and merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden’. In addition to this, the Russian naval presence poses also a threat to NATO and the other Western countries, which possess navies in the Red Sea.

The Ambition of Gender Equality,"The achievement of gender equality in Europe is now subject to anew ambitious plan. On 25th November, the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy signed theGender Action Plan (GAP) III, to achieve the goal ofequalityandempowerment by 2025.COVID-19constituted a major obstacle, but even before it proceeded at a slow pace. EIGE (European Institute for Gender Equality) declared in its document‘Gender Equality Index 2020:  Digitalisation and the future of work’that the improvement has been slight and “at this pace – 1 point every 2 years – it will take more than 60 years to achieve gender equality in the EU”.
The Index encompasses six plus two domains (work, money, knowledge, time, health, power, as well as violence against women and intersecting inequalities) with 31 indicators per 28 countries. The domain most affected is power, which counts the highest gender inequality. The long-standing absence of women in leading positions was a constant until 2019, when Ursula von der Leyen was elected as the President of the European Commission, followed by Christine Lagarde as President of the European Central Bank. As the document released by EIGE reminds us, “gender balance in economic decision-making also forms part of the SDGs”. Goal 5.5 claims women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life. The empowerment of women and promotion of their equality will lead the EU’s external actions in 2021-2025.
Thejoint staff working document (SWD)is divided into two parts. Part I identifies 11 objectives. For every action, indicators, baselines, and targets are specified, as well as data sources and actors where possible. For instance, objective 1.4. calls for funding to women’s rights organisations and movements to contribute to gender equality. The indicator is the amount of funding; the baseline (which indicates the latest data available from the GAP II Annual Implementation Report 2019 or other sources) has to be defined; the target, for this action, would be the increase to the level of funding allocated to movements and associations working toward gender equality. The data sources used are Creditor Reporting System CRS, OECD DAC (the database signals where aid goes, what purposes it serves and what policies it aims to implement, on a comparable basis for all DAC members; data are collected on individual projects and programs (focus is on financial data but some descriptive information is also made available)) or other equivalent COM databases.
Part II indicates a menu of objectives and indicators for each of the six thematic areas of engagement; “There are also selected qualitative indicators which seek to capture the hard-to-measure changes in social norms and attitudes and transformations in gender power relations”. After identifying an overall thematic objective, it is split into further specific thematic objectives with key thematic outcome indicators. For instance, the Thematic area of engagement concerning freedom from all forms of gender-based violence encompasses eight specific objectives, which take into account: spheres of protection, gender norms, active control of own sexuality and reproductive rights, and exploitation and fragile contexts.
Lastly, the joint staff working document (SWD) complements thejoint communication to the European Parliament and the Council. It defines gender equality as a key political objective, in which the EU constitutes a global front-runner; “The EU pursues a three-pronged approach, combining gender mainstreaming, targeted actions and political dialogue”. The difference with EU gender equality strategy 2020 – 2025 is that GAP III addresses the issue globally, as stated in the joint communication. It provides a policy framework for the EU to boost its level of engagement, focusing on five pillars:
The year 2020 celebrates two finishes: the resolution 1325, the resolution adopted by Un Security Council in 2000 and concerning women, peace, and security; theBeijing Platform for Action(BPfA) adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. The resolution 1325 affirmed the centrality of women in societies, as a crucial actor and factor for sustainable and long-lasting peace. But also, it called for the protection of women in conflicts, and the adoption of gender perspectives in all United Nations peace and security efforts.
The BPfA was anunprecedented event for the number of participants involved(17.000 participants, 30.000 activists, 189 governments represented) and for the new perspective adopted. It identified 12 critical areas of concern, imaging gender equality in every field. It still constitutes an inspiration for the insiders and not. Nevertheless, in March 2020 the President of the European Commission stated that:
“Gender equality is acore principleof the European Union, but it isnotyeta reality.”
Also, the same joint staff working document claimed that “there is, however, not a single country in the world that is close to achieving by 2030 gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls.”
Thus, the GAP III  is ambitious because it sets goals and indicators (quantitative and qualitative) imagining a broad global action. Its action will be developed combining gender mainstreaming, targeted actions and political dialogue. The ambition resides in its multidimensional approach: from the eradication of the root causes of inequality to the engagement at country, regional and multilateral levels, to setting objectives and action in thematic policy areas. Because “challenges also bring opportunities”, to shine and thrive.

Brexit: What Now for the UK and Eastern Europe?,"The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 December 2020. TheEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreementdetails the framework for cooperation between the UK and EU post-Brexit. The three pillars of the Agreement cover Trade, Security, and Governance. The new Free Trade Agreement focuses on economy, transport, institutional and environmental protections, fishing, and energy. It also pinpoints social security coordination for the rights of EU nationals in the UK and vice versa. The Security aspect focuses on cooperation in criminal and civil law matters, including terrorism. Finally, the Governance section entails the implementation of the Agreement itself by assuring clarity for businesses, consumers, and citizens, and establishing mechanisms to resolve potential disputes concerning the Agreement.
Overall, the Agreement characterizes the UK’s future relations with the EU as a whole, but it also raises interest as to what future cooperation may specifically exist between the UK and Eastern Europe. These regions were primarily linked through their mutual membership of the EU and, consequently, by migration from the East as a spill-over effect of this membership.Can the UK and Eastern Europe still sustain a link, or will ties between theminevitably loosen?Regardless of whether future cooperation will exist or not, there is potential for Brexit to benefit Eastern Europe politically and economically.
Eastern European migration to the UK after 2004 created, perhaps, the biggest link between the two regions. AlthoughEU nationals account for approximately 5.5% of the UK population, the new membership of countries like Poland, Romania, and Hungary to the EU has forged extensive social, political, and economic ties between the UK and Eastern Europe. However, since the 2016 Brexit referendum, net migration to the UK  by EU8 citizens (Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Estonia) hasdropped.
Throughout theearly 2016 negotiationsto implement EU reforms proposed by UK Prime Minister David Cameron, disagreements persisted between the UK and Eastern European countries over EU migrants in the UK. In fact, the majority of the latter came from Eastern Europe. These points of disagreement included the length of the ’emergency brake’ for in-work benefits for new EU workers in the UK, as well as restrictions on child benefit payments to EU migrants.
Eastern European migration to the UK became a focal point surrounding the Brexit vote.Rhetoric about migration became blurred and negative attitudes towards the surrounding (non-EU) refugee crisis were also ascribed to EU migrants. This merely added to existing negative political attitudes towards EU migrants in the UK and soon became akey contributing factorto the decisive ‘Leave’ vote in the Brexit referendum.
Former UK Prime MinisterTheresa Maydescribed rising EU migration as “unsustainable” and associated immigration with the poor economy, depleting public services, and declining social cohesion. CurrentPrime Minister Boris Johnsonhas regarded migrants as individuals taking advantage of the UK and treating it “as though it’s part of their own country”. He used this statement to emphasize the need for a points-based immigration system. Government statements like this helped reinforce an ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ approach among British nationals and EU migrants.
Much of Eastern European sentiments on migration, in light of the 2016 negotiations and the subsequent Brexit proceedings, were of caution and defense. In response to David Cameron’s proposals to curb migrant benefits,Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbándeclared that Hungarian migrants in the UK “belong to the world of the fair working people”; they were not “parasites”. Despite that, he laterexpressed contentmentwith the UK and EU’s initial Withdrawal Agreement (2018), for the protection it afforded to migrants in the UK.Slovakia’s Prime Ministerat the time of the Brexit vote, Robert Fico, asserted that Britain would not be allowed to make “second-class citizens” out of EU workers in the UK.
Polandhas displayed a particularly cautious approach, urging Polish migrants in the UK to secure their residencies and pressing the UK Government to protect their rights. However, the Polish Government has also encouraged its citizens to return to Poland which extends from Poland’s need to boost its domestic economy with higher employment. In this sense, Brexit is arguably an opportunity to drive more Polish citizens back to their source country. Nevertheless, the annualIntergovernmental Consultationsbetween the UK and Poland will support an independent relationship between the two. Much of these consultations are focused on shared security and economic priorities, signifying some elements of continuity of their former EU membership.
The UK has now implemented a new points-basedimmigration system, designed to bring in skilled workers with preliminary job offers. The Government maintains that the system will treat EU and non-EU citizens equally. EU migrants living in the UK before 31 December 2020 can apply to have ‘settled status’, allowing them to stay.Although the new system poses greater obstacles to new migrants arriving from the EU, including Eastern Europe, it maintains protections for EU migrants already living in the UK.Those were, after all, the people that source countries’ governments were primarily concerned about, hence the regions remain linked via migration. However, migration is no longer facilitated under an open and communal ‘free movement’ framework.
The UK and the majority of Eastern European countries are still connected through theirmutual membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is a military alliance with a political focus on ensuring security for its members and resolving conflict. Through principles such ascollective defense, its members are unified in facing international conflict.
Much of this alliance is in place to counter Russia, a neighbor of the EU’s and NATO’s Eastern European members. Ongoing disputes between NATO and Russia concern the respective parties’ activities throughout bordering regions. In November 2020, aNATO exercise in Romanialaunched missiles into the Black Sea, near the Crimean Peninsula. The Crimean Parliament saw this as preparation for an “armed invasion” of Russia’s territory.
Such activities near Russia’s border, deemed as aggressions, will require close and continued cooperation between the UK and NATO’s Eastern European members. This is especially important in asserting the principle of defence, as Eastern Europe will be the first to receive retaliations. Ahead of the UK’s official leave from the EU,Boris Johnsonre-emphasised NATO’s mission statement of “peace and security for 29 countries”, promising to “come to one another’s defence”.
TheUK has been an active NATO contributorin maintaining defense against Russia on Eastern European territory. Therefore,while cooperation under the EU framework will cease to exist, NATO will preserve a security alliance between the UK and Eastern Europe.Nonetheless, NATO is strictly a military organization, hence it will do little to make up for the loss of much broader political and economic partnerships previously ensured by EU membership.
Economically, Eastern Europe will still make gains where the UK made losses following Brexit, even if ties between the two become weaker.The East’s manufacturing industries boomed as the UK’s declined. For example, the UK car industry declined by 80% as automobile manufacturers began relocating to Eastern Europe. Areporthighlighting the effects of Brexit on Japanese companies in the UK revealed that one company moved all of its manufacturing to Poland, while another moved some of its manufacturing to Hungary. Other companies also considered relocation to Eastern European countries, such as Romania. British companyJaguar Land Roverestablished a factory in Slovakia in 2016.
Firms have moved their manufacturing to mainland Europe due to a fear of rising import and export costs, as well as increased business regulations as a result of Brexit. With a continuing membership of the EU and the single market, Eastern European countries allow companies to avoid these costs, in addition to the lower labor and processing costs that the region provides.Director of Germany’s Center for Automotive Research Ferdinand Dudenhoefferhas stated that Eastern Europe, along with Turkey, is “significantly more cost-effective” for automobile production.
The UK’s departure from the EU has also created space for stronger relations within the Union. EU enlargement since 2004 defined a new framework of cooperation and shared values between the EU and its new members; namely those in Eastern Europe. However,enlargement also highlighted gapsbetween the ‘old’ and ‘new’ members (the UK being a part of the EU’s ‘old’ members).
Economically, Eastern Europe has been perceived as lagging behind Western Europe, but, at the same time, it was also being exploited for the benefit of the West. Politically, obstacles to establishing a common European vision have also lingered. The political systems and priorities of Eastern European nations are typically at odds with those of Western Europe, including areas such as non-EU migration and democratization.
However,Brexit will likely harmonize relations within the EU, including relations between ‘old’ and ‘new’ member states, as well as relations between the ‘new’ member states and the institutional center. Those differences previously at the forefront of intra-EU relations are likely to be scaled down following Brexit.
A strengthened manufacturing hub in the East will contribute to a reduced economic gap between Western and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the UK’s leave will also foster new harmony among the 27 members; defining new common political values and underlining the priority to remain within a union of states.
Ultimately, the greatest link between the UK and Eastern Europe continues to be migration.NATO preserves a security partnership between the regions, but it lacks the political and economic relationship previously provided by mutual EU membership. Through social relations and mutual economic benefits, the link of migration is currently the strongest factor sustaining this political and economic relationship.Nevertheless, Eastern Europe has been able to reap independent economic and political benefits as a result of Brexit.This can arguably level the playing field between Eastern Europe and the UK in a way not previously capacitated by the EU.

[Analysis] Capitol Hill Is Under Siege,"Over the decades and the centuries, America has been regarded (or perhaps, narrated) as thebeacon for Democracyand hope in the Western world, as the shining city upon a hill which symbolizes what is righteous and virtuous in the world. The ideals of a manifest destiny, of the United States being a nation chosen by God and meant to spread democracy around the world, have guided American people and leaders to act as the symbol and protectors of Western democracy, as the representation of the importance and power of freedom. On January 6th, 2021,the shining city upon a hill has been sieged, and the symbol of American democracy has been violated on world live television.
At the bottom of the mayhem at Capitol Hill are a series of events that led to this insurgent attack against American democracy. Some might argue that this all startedon November 7th,when the votes for the US Presidential Elections were rightfully counted, and Joseph R. Biden wasnominated President Elected of the United Statesas he won his race against Donald Trump. The failure to lock a second term sparked controversy on behalf of the sitting President and many of his Republican enclave, who built up a narrative of the 2020 presidential election being fraudulent. The account built by the Trump Administration portrayed the Democratic Party stealing the election fromthe self-proclaimed ‘rightful winners,’and prompted Trump loyalists to disregard the electoral outcomes under the slogan#StopTheSteal. Little impact had the plethora of judges and courts thatdebunked any possible allegation of fraudulent behavioursduring the elections.
The deceiving and unfounded notions of a ‘stolen election‘ that President Trump fed to his electoral base reportedly ignited a sense of resentment and rejection of the once-worshippedlaw and order, as Trump and his followers deemed every news media or lawful trial fake and corruptedwhile increasingly relying on conspiracy theories(QAnon above all). The degree to which Donald Trump managed to shift voters’ loyalty from the Grand Old Party (G.O.P.) onto himself would seem to characterize a personalistic cult rather than a political faction.
I am your president of law and order.
After months of building onconspiracy theories, baseless claims, and divisive narratives to polarize American voters, President Trump unleashed the destructive potential of such a partisan tension on January 6th. During his ‘Save America’ rally in front of the White House, Trump reiterated his unfounded claims of fraudulent election, andurged the thousands of people rallied in Washington to march towards Capitol Hillto demonstrate their malcontent and frustration, where at the time the Electoral Count was taking place to officialize Biden’s victory as Trump ended his speech:
All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they’re doing and stolen by the fake news media. That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing.We will never give up. We will never concede.
What followed was the demonstration of all the destructive potential of the hate and resentment lurking among the American people. In what expertsdescribed as asiegerather than a ‘coup’(the protesters were armed but seemingly lacked a central paramilitary nucleus), Trump supporters breached through the poorly organized law enforcement officials deployed on the site and stormed Capitol Hill through broken windows and forced entry points. It is also worthy of notice the dissimilarities in police response in Washington D.C. between the Capitol Hill siege andthe Black Lives Matter proteststhat took place in the summer of 2020, where not only was the National Guard promptly called to intervene, but also cases ofexcessive force by police and federal officerswere reported. As chaos surged, Trump’s insurgents broke through the halls of the American Senate – symbolically violating a central landmark of democracy worldwide that had been left unscathed since the British attack in 1814 during the War of 1812, when the Queen’s troops set fire to the Capitol.
On Thursday, local authorities secured adeath toll of 4 and 50 injured police officersas a result of the pro-Trump mobilization. The storming of Capitol Hill did not prevent however the joint Chambers of the Congress from returning to the building and confirmingformer Senator Biden’s nomination as 46th President Of The United States. It was the sitting President himself to call off the siege through a 1-minute video posted through his social media, although the message addressed to his supporters did not fall short of sparking further controversy as passages of support for the mob featured in Trump’s plea for “peace.” In the – now removed – tweet, President Trump urged revolters to “go home” without condemning the violent acts undertaken by his supporters, and rather adding“we love you, you’re special”after repeating groundless claims of electoral fraud. A longer, more official message ensued on the POTUS’ twitter account, in which outgoing President Trump condemned the siege stating that “demonstrators who infiltrated the capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy.”

Noticeably, Trump’s rhetoric did not feature references to ‘stolen elections’ and instead broached the first formal acknowledgement of an orderly transition of power despite the strong belief that “we must reform our election laws:”
A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring asmooth,orderlyandseamless transition of power
G.O.P. lawmakers’ trend of bandwagoning on the President’s dangerously violent words and narratives have have ultimately come to a head. “Trump,” writesElaine Godfrey for The Atlantic, “has been a blunt instrument they can use to retain power, appoint conservative judges, and pass tax cuts.” “Today, these Republicans finally confronted the monster they’ve created,”she adds. The events of Wednesday mark a neat and outspoken break between Trumpism and a significant section of the Conservative Party, with only a handful of G.O.P. senators and representatives notably keeping up their unconditional support for the POTUS. Among the latter group was also Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whocertified the objection of 60 G.O.P. Representatives to the tally of the Electoral Collegein a last, desperate attempt to slow down the inevitable officialization of Senator Biden’s election as 46th President of the US.
Along with the deconsolidation of the Republican front,talks of removal from officefor President Trump are intensifying from both aisles of Congress. While several G.O.P. Senators have officially denounced the pro-Trump rioters in Washington D.C., some have responded to the President fanning the flames bypublicly withdrawing from the objection against the Electoral Tally in Congress. A first option for removal from office was introduced by soon-to-be Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, joined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who prompted Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment, which regulates presidential succession in case of resignation, death, illness or temporary incapacitation of the sitting president. The Amendment would require the Vice President and a majority of the Trump cabinet – i.e., the leading officials from federal agencies – todeclare President Trump “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”under the disability clause, with a two-thirds majority vote required in both chambers of Congress to ratify the procedure. The amendment enshrined a multistage process that is arguably less attainable than a second impeachment procedure as “the authors of the 25th Amendment intended it to be a difficult process that would make it exceedingly rare,”NYT White House correspondent Michael Shearwrites.
Moreover, as the option was presented on the table,a long list of resignations from Trump’s cabinet ensued, including key figures like Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, Transportation Secretary (and G.O.P. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s spouse)Elaine Chao, and Special Envoy to Northern Ireland and Former Chief of StaffMick Mulvaney. Although these resignations carry a mere symbolic value as cabinet members will terminate their employ under the Trump Administration on January 20, political commentators believe that the exodus of Trump officials may respond also to the need toescape external political pressures to vote in favor of the Amendment XXV procedure and esautorate Trump once and for all, should VP Pence invoke it.
Sources close to the Vice Presidentindicate that, however, Pence’s leadership in single-handedly invoking the 25th Amendment is unlikely. A second option, theimpeachmentprocedure (not a first for Donald Trump), was therefore presented by Speaker Pelosi in the aftermath of the siege on Thursday as a last resort in case of the Vice President’s failure to take action. As Senate G.O.P. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed to have definitely distanced himself from the POTUS aftercondemning Republican objections to the Electoral Tally on Wednesday, hopes for a success in impeaching the sitting president would seem less grim than before. Assistant House Speaker Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts confirmedon Twitterthat Democratic House members are “actively working to determine the timeline and the quickest path to hold Trump accountable.” The articles of Impeachment cannot be introduced sooner thanon January 11, when the House is first scheduled to reconvene, and the little time available (less than 14 days) to reach a simple majority in the House and a supermajority in the Senate before Biden’s inauguration renders an impeachment trial beyond challenging. Yet, the determination and anger lingering in Congress following the humiliation of rioters interrupting the sacred rituals of presidential transition could be a strong enough galvanizer of consensus among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
It would an extremely dangerous understatement to say that all of this was just the results of the aftermath of the election, nor just a consequence of the 4-years Trump’s presidency. These sentiments of violence and frustration have been lurking among the American people for a long time, andPresident Trump is both the product and the enabler of this environment. In 2016, Trump had been able to rally people towards the G.O.P., by building his campaign around a strong and aggressive economic and anti-migration rhetoric, which convinced the American voters, after themistakes committed by the Obama administration, that they needed a new way to put “America First.” And, this tactic proved to be effective, as he managed tobuild on the already strong party basewhich had previously voted for Mitt Romney,while also appealing to white-collar Democratic voters. During his 4-years presidency, his vision forAmerica Firstis exactly what he enacted, by fostering aggressive foreign policies (such asthe mercantilist war with China, and the withdrawal from the Transpacific Partnership), and by cutting down many welfare programs such as MediCare and MedicAid, and reducing individual taxation with the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017.
However, over these four years, through the many controversies and critiques from both the Democrats and the Republicans, Trump’s political grip started loosening.Hence, as he started loosing faith of the more moderate voters – as also theexit polls of the 2020 election show–Trump started to appeal to the more extremist fringes of his voters, as they were the only one who still held faith and trust in him despite the many controversies. All this came to a head with theCovid-19 crisis, which President Trump dangerously failed to handle, and led to thedeath of more than 300.000 Americansand to the realization for many previous Trump voters that this President was not fit to guide the Nation during such a crisis. With the presidential elections in sight, the Trump campaign consequently convened toappeal to the far-right fringes of the POTUS’ supporters ever more, as they remained the stronghold of his electoral base. Therefore, President Trump is arguably culpable for having given a voice to fringes of the population and of the political spectrum, which however were already existing, waiting for the moment to rise to the surface.
This ambivalence within the Republican party between Conservatives and Far-Right extremismshas always existed; yet, with President Trump it has been brought to the mainstream, as he hasgiven voice and legitimacy to sycophantic entities. The siege of Capitol Hill is the culmination of a decades-long process of decay of American politics, which started with the 2009 economic crisis and the shortcomings of the Obama administration, and the results of ideals and conspiracy theories which have been growing in the background out of sight, waiting for the right moment – or better,the right leader– to unleash them to the world.
And, what is even more concerning, is that during the coverage of the siege, as well as within several comments from prominent figures and former statesmen such as theformer presidents Obamaand Bush, a common narrative was that this act was not the American Way. Nonetheless,the polarization of the American electorateandthe incitation of far-right, arm-bearing fringesamong the G.O.P. voters against the ordinary processes of democracy and the sanctity of the rule of law is an entirely domestic phenomenon. This event, sadly,is the American way,or at least part of it. The attack on Capitol Hill is the quintessential manifestation of a part of America which is there: a bigot, violent, and seemingly erratic part for sure, but still a portion of the American people that needs to be re-enfranchised, and most importantlyrepresented.
Trump’s rhetoric is centered around fuelingthe lack of faith in the systemand thedisinformationin his supporters. Throughout his mandate, he was able to manipulate their disinformation to the point ofdisillusionand complete detachment from the complex journalistic and political environment that contributes to what is referred to as “political truth” – a system of checks and balances between lawmakers’ rhetoric and narratives and journalists’ criticisms and fact-checking. De facto, Trump’s leadership has materialized in thedisenfranchisement of a wide section of Republican electoral base. The utter distrust against governmental institutions and processes, the total detachment from political reality, and the sense of victimhood perpetuated and bolstered by conspiracy theories that the President himself endorsed all converged onto the separation of American voters from the Chambers of House and Senate as a source of law, order, and government.
If you are a conservative, this is the most offensive concept in the world: thata single person could disenfranchise 155 million people.
A representation of the mob that sieged Capitol Hill as a mere extremism would benefit neither the American people nor President-Elect Biden and Vice President-ElectHarris’ arduous undertaking of unifying once again the country after four years of unprecedented societal cleavages. Rioters’ ideals and actions represent the sentiments of a significant part of the American people,a portion of the society which is ready to strike againunder the right pressure and leadership. By continuing to purposely sweep under the rug these fringes, and by perpetrating the utopia of America as the beacon of hope and democracy in the world, reconciliating such vast a portion of the American population with the political democratic establishment of the Republic could prove too arduous a task. Only by reintegrating this section of the people under the realm of politics and reason, information and science can the Biden administration possibly uphold its mission toheal the soul of America.
The city upon a hill is burning. The siege at Capitol Hill represents not only one of the darkest moment of American history, but also a direct attack to democracy. And, by continuing to belittle it as just an extremism, as an unwarranted act of violence, American democracy is in peril of weakening more than it already has.

Jozef Chovanec’s Slaughter Investigated By Belgium And Slovakia,"Jozef Chovanec was a Slovak national, arrested by the Belgian airport police at Brussels’ Charleroi Airport in February 2018. He was detained due to, allegedly, forcing his way onto a plane after being unable to produce his boarding pass. Chovanec’s wife, Henrieta Chovancova, releasedvideo footageshowing him in his holding cell, repeatedly hitting his head against the door until covered in blood. Later, several police officers enter the cell and pin him down for 16 minutes.
During this time, one of the officers performs a Nazi salute while laughing with her colleagues. Near the end of the video, paramedics arrive at the cell while the police is still pinning Chovanec down, who appears unconscious. This element fed into the belief that the officers were trying to suffocate him. As the police leave the cell, the paramedics attempt to resuscitate Chovanec, before taking him away. The next day, Jozef Chovanec was reported as having died of cardiac arrest in hospital.
The investigation into the mistreatment and subsequent death of Jozef Chovanec will soon reach its third anniversary. The case regained widespread attention among Slovak social media users in June 2020, asBlack Lives Matter protests broke out in the USA. Amid theglobal movement against police brutality, Henrieta Chovancova decided to release the cell footage of her husband while apprehended by the Belgian police. The aim was to highlight it as another case of unjustified police violence.
The new footage was accompanied byChovancova’s frustration with the ongoing inquiry, which, in her view, was losing traction and was failing to shed light on the events and thus ensure accountability. In response, Slovak authorities re-emphasised the case internationally and have since tried to gain external support in speeding up the inquiry, although with limited success. Despite retaining doubts about the Belgian authorities’ handling of the case,Slovakiais now partaking in aninternational cooperative effort withBelgiumto unearth the details of the incident.
Since 2018, the investigation into Chovanec’s death has beenin the hands of Belgian prosecutors. Charleroi’s public prosecutor’s office has reported that all police officers involved in the incident were interviewed; however, further proceedings were claimed to be delayed due to COVID-19. Meanwhile, Mons’ public prosecutor’s office stated that there was no plan to charge the officers with any crimes at the moment. In fact, at the present time,all officers are still in service.
Following the release of the full cell footage,Belgium’s director-general of federal police, André Desenfants, announced he would temporarily step down from his position. Desenfants described the incident as shocking. He further expressed his outrage at not being “made aware of facts of such seriousness”. Aseparate investigationby the Belgian’s police oversight body, Committee P, confirmed this affirmation. The investigation has concluded thatseveral members of the airport police had seen the footage at the time of the incident, but had failed to notify a higher authority.
Around the same time,the lawyer of the police officer who performed the Nazi salute released a statement. The policewoman claimed the action was a humorous response to supposed accusatory remarks by Chovanec to the officers. The statement, however, did little to alleviate the outrage towards this particular moment in the video. On social media, the widespread conviction was that the use of a Nazi symbol by a Belgian officer was sufficient to classify the treatment of Chovanec as xenophobic.
Despite these marginal developments, the handling of the inquiry thus far has been criticized.Henrieta Chovancova has been particularly vocal on her distrust of the Belgian prosecutors. She shared her view that the prosecutors, along with then-Interior Minister Jan Jambon, were involved in a cover-up of the incident, prioritized with protecting the police.Jan Jambon has publicly declared the situation as “inadmissible”, while stating his general respect for the job of the police. In addition, Chovancova stated her conviction that her husband died in his cell, at the hands of the police officers. According to her, the ruling of his death as a cardiac arrest was part of the cover-up.
Slovakia’s President,Zuzana Čaputová, has also spoken on the issue. She has labelled ita matter of police brutality, with the aggravating circumstance that it has not been properly investigated.
Since the airing of increased scepticism,Belgium’s High Council of Justice has opened an investigationinto the Mons public prosecutor’s office, addressing the issues with its handling of the inquiry. However,it has since concludedthere was no attempt by investigators to withhold information from the case.
In September of 2020,Slovak MEPs sent a letter to the President of the European Parliament David Sassoli. The letter demanded that the Parliament helps bring to justice the perpetrators of Jozef Chovanec’s killing. In the letter, the MEPs stated:
“The European Parliament, as an institutiondefending human rights worldwide, must take astrongandunequivocal positionon the inappropriate action by Belgian law enforcement authorities”.
The writing also highlighted the extremist nature of the police approach, as shown in the cell footage. It pointed out to the President how such actions directly conflict with EU values.
Additionally, the Slovak Parliamentpassed a resolution, urging its Government to request thatEU Justice CommissionerDidierReyndersleads the investigation. It deemed the case entailed police brutality, and that Belgian prosecutors were dealing with it inadequately. Similarly to the letter sent by MEPs, the Parliament called for EU intervention, based on the belief that this would accelerate the inquiry. The objective was to provide a more thorough investigation than the one carried out since 2018. Reynders’ input was specifically requested as he was the Belgian Foreign Minister at the time of Chovanec’s death. He would have been in a position to establish a close cooperation with the Slovak Government.
We support the demand for a full investigation into the case of Jozef Chovanec, who died after being held in custody at Charleroi airport. Respect for human rights and the rule of law is fundamental. The@Europarl_ENis following the case closely.https://t.co/If6hA7RdyJpic.twitter.com/GnaKHNCkUu
David Sassoli made a symbolic call on Belgium to provide clarity on the case. However,EU representatives promptly declinedthe plea for direct intervention, on the grounds that the EU does not have authority to interfere in member states’ domestic affairs. In short, Slovak and Belgian authorities should solve the issue alone. Considering that the Slovak request for EU input centered precisely on the distrust towards Belgium’s handling of the investigation, this put Slovakia back to square one.
Notwithstanding the setback to Slovakia’s hope for EU engagement, Belgian and Slovak authorities have renewed their willingness to cooperate. TheSlovak Parliament has remained firmin its demand that its Belgian counterpart holds the culpable officers accountable.As the cooperation resumed in 2020,Belgium’s Prime Minister, Sophie Wilmès, expressed to Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovičher intention to bring those responsible for Chovanec’s death to justice. Unfortunately, Alexander de Croo replaced her recently, and he has not yet spoken out on the matter.
Cooperation efforts will continue underEurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation.The first coordination meeting between then-Deputy Prosecutor General of Slovakia, Viera Kovacikova, and Belgian Prosecutor General, Ignacio de la Serna, set up the forthcoming partnership. Additionally, all mutual legal assistance will take place on Slovak territory.
From the investigation, Slovakia seekstransparencyandaccountabilitysurrounding Jozef Chovanec’s death. Meanwhile, both the Slovak and Belgian people anticipate that the concluding report will answer for the police brutality, as well as the suspected xenophobia and extremism, depicted in the video footage. This is not surprising, since the case regained momentum in the context of a global movement against police brutality. Its transparent execution will be significant in its contribution to inflamed public discourse on policing procedures and their ensuing violence.
The extent to which Belgium and Slovakia will successfully cooperate to bring the investigation to a just end willdetermine the future trajectory of similar cases; especially, cases which bring international scope to domestic affairs. This incident is not a singular police brutality case. It is, however, one of few which raises a domestic issue of this nature to the international level. The forthcoming cross-border examination of a national police force will reflect new boundaries for international input into domestic mechanisms. This will involve debate on thelevel of scrutinythat Slovakia can subject Belgium’s police to.
Finally, it is true theEuropean Unionhas removed itself from the inquiry. However, Belgium and Slovakia’s cooperation will still be meaningful for the pillar of political partnership. If the investigation proceeds swiftly, it will demonstrate the significance of mutual EU membership. It may affirm that this membership is more enhanced than standard international cooperation between states.

Air Confrontation Between Four Countries Distresses East Asia,"While the world is still dealing with the impacts of the pandemic, Russian and Chinese militaries seem to be growing closer than ever. On December 22nd, 2020, Russian and Chinese bombers flew a joint patrol mission over an area of the Western Pacific dangerously close to the disputed territories between China, South Korea, and Japan. This mission, proudly announced by the Russian Ministry of Defence on media platforms like Twitter, succeeds an initial one in 2019 which had already shaken up peace in East Asia.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Sino-Russian joint patrol flight was “carried out to deepen and develop the Russian-Chinese relations of the comprehensive partnership, further increase the level of interaction between the armed forces of the two countries, improve their capabilities to conduct joint action, and strengthen global strategic stability.”  This statement meets the agreement of theMinistry of Defence of the PRC, which states such a partnership is essential for improving the joint operational capabilities of the two air forces and ultimately levelling up the military.
While joint partnerships between the militaries and air forces of different countries are not unusual, it is instead the current global situation that has Japan and South Korea worried of a Sino-Russian military alliance. In fact, Japan and South Korea share a common partner –the US– currently weakened by its intra-national political instability and domestic health dilemma. The recent2021 military mobilization prospectsannounced by China’s military on the official website of China’s Ministry of Defence are soon to become a regional and international concern.
In July 2019, two Russian Tu-95 bombers, an unarmed Russian A-50 command and control plane, and two Chinese H-6 bombers led a military exercise as part of a joint patrol over the Western Pacific. Particularly, this occurred in the air zone above the Dokdo Islands (so-called Takeshima Islands in Japan), which Japan and South Korea both claim as their own.
As an areaalready disputedbetween these countries, the presence of Russian and Chinese air forces was deemed problematic. South Korea’s military sent out 30 warnings to the Russian A-50 without receiving response. It later teamed up with Tokyo scrambling fighter jets to intercept the Sino-Russian patrol, ending up with South Korean warplanes firing “360 warning shots ahead of the Russian aircraft, 80 during the first violation and 280 during the second, using 20mm weapons”, as reported by CNN.
This incident was later denied by the Kremlin in a series of statements and created diplomatic turmoil between the Sino-Russian and Japan-South Korean factions. Japan withholds important data that would prove the Russian military at fault, however, the conclusion of this incident remains blurred in history.

The blurred ending to the 2019 mission is what could have allowed this to happen once again in December 22nd 2020.Reutersreported that four Chinese warplanes and 15 Russian aircraft entered the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ), according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
This time, the South Korean militarypromptly dispatchedair force fighters as a strategic measure but also confirmed that the Chinese military had informed South Korea that its planes were carrying out routine training prior to their entrance into the KADIZ. Nevertheless, the Foreign Ministry of South Korea also contacted China and Russia to warn them these shall not become recurrent exercises in the area.
This 2nd joint aerial strategic patrol was confirmed in anofficial announcementreleased by the Ministry of National Defence of the PRC and the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. According to the announcement, four H-6K Chinese bombers and (only) two Tu-95 Russian bombers had conducted joint patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, but that they observed “the relevant provisions of international law and did not enter the airspace of other countries”. The announcement also stated that China and Russia are aiming to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership and enhance the level of coordination and joint operational capabilities of their militaries.
Furthermore, the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed themission was part of an annual recurrencebetween China and Russia and was not meant to be of an alarming nature to third parties.
One question, then, remains:Why are Sino-Russian joint patrols repeatedly taking the same routes knowing this would anger their neighbours?
Analysing data is a useful method in understanding the military power of both China and Russia, which may be the most important factor concerning Japan and South Korea.
According to SIPRI’s data,Russia and China are among the top 5 military spenders in the world. As of 2019, China ranked 2nd, just below the United States, while Russia ranked 4th on the list of global military powers.
A table on the right has gathered data from different sources concerning these countries’ defence budget and military details. However, it is important to mention that it remains difficult to verify this data as most sources report them in different ways. BothCSISandSIPRItend to argue that there may be a gap between the actual versus the officially reported data.
Indeed, official sources including Chinese sources state that theNational Defence Budget for China in 2020 was US$178.2 billion. As shown in the column chart below, however, SIPRI estimates the actual budget goes beyond US$ 200 billion. This number is not unusual considering the amount of personnel employed by Chinese military authorities.
CSISbelieves that, over the past year, the impact of COVID-19 may have amended the resources employed in military spending. Studies show that inflation does play a role when looking at the overall trends of defence spending, which makes seriously question the probability of SIPRI’s estimated values for 2020.
Nonetheless, it is true that President Xi Jinping remains committed to his vision of modernizing the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by2035. In fact, these mid-air incidents prove COVID-19 did not stop China or Russia pursuing their military reform plans. If, by any chance, the current pandemic did impact their budget, then these powers may be simply halving costs by working together through joint missions and exercises.
What may be worrying Japan and South Korea is that a stronger military partnership may also imply stronger nuclear cooperation. With the unresolved situation in North Korea, and China not necessarily taking a pro or con stance on Pyongyang, a united Sino-Russian front might make neighbours feel endangered by any upcoming nuclear threat. Russia brings with it a heavy bag of nuclear knowledge after the Cold War and nowadays, the Russians store a total number of 6490 warheads and 1600 deployed warheads, more than the US. Also, it was the Soviet Union who created the Tsar Bomba, the biggest bomb in the world with a blast yield of 50 megatons of TNT. China is also building solid nuclear bases and has already been engaged in testing atomic and hydrogen devices since 1964. Data regarding China’s stock of accumulated and deployed warheads is uncertain.
As “cold” conflicts continue, having become the most common means of war (e.g. US-China Trade War), however we cannot overlook other areas in which Russia and China are certainly affirming themselves as lead powers. Among these includes research on outer space and Antarctica, which will inevitably become increasingly relevant for the future of international politics and mankind alike.
In the meantime, China’s military growth is continuing in 2021 with the latest reforms.
President of China and Chairman of the Military Commission of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping, has signed the “Central Military Commission Order No. 1 of 2021” on January 4th. The order invites the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the People’s Armed Police Force (PAPF) to uphold the mission of building a strong Chinese military with relevant training and more focus on combat preparedness for the new year.
The2021 Military Training and Mobilization Orderencourages:
The media believes that these decisions may be related to the Taiwan situation and that they have been set to contain possible major incidents related to Taiwan’s strive for independence. Particularly, this comes as a preparation for eventual emergencies resulting from a change of US leadership andmodus operandithrough which the US may approach the Taiwan issue in the near future. The US would be allegedly violating the “One China” principle with the upcoming “U.S.-Taiwan Political and Military Dialogue“.
The alleged lack of transparency is nourishing concerns from both the Japanese and South Korean sides, especially because of their difficulty to understand other powers’ need to conduct frequent joint patrols in the Sea of Japan. These countries, like others in East Asia, are questioning the rationale behind the growing Sino-Russian military partnership in a moment where the world is weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic and where even the thought of war should be non-existent.
Minor powers in East Asia feel endangered by the very firm stance held by China and Russia against issues that will become heated again in 2021. Among these, Hong Kong and Taiwan are key concerns, as Hong Kongers keep being welcomed as eligible nationals in the UK and as new President of the United States Joe Biden pursues communication with Taiwan.
Cold diplomatic ties could indeed be in the horizon, and the military involvement of China and Russia implies that other big powers in the Westmay prepare to balance militarily speaking. Ultimately, silence among states and a lack of clear communication remains the root cause of potential conflict and war yet in 2021.
A few questions, then, remain unanswered:

"[Analysis] China’s Energy Sustainability, the 2060 Vision, and the EU","ThePeople’s Republic of Chinahas become one of the most prominent geopolitical leaders worldwide, with a booming economy, growing domestic consumption, and a skyrocketing rise of global financial influence through world-renowned investment projects such as the infamous Belt and Road initiative. Such a rise has deeply affected itsenergy consumption, requiring a prevalently coal-driven energetic production to keep up with its ramping economic growth.
At the same time, growing concerns for sustainability have strengthened foreign and internal pressures on Chinese policymakers to increase the country’s commitments to greener energy production and consumption vis-à-vis the PRC’s carbon abatement objectives announced in multilateral fora. In particular, theEuropean Unionhas earmarked a substantial amount of resources to the Chinese energy transition as the latter has been perceived as one of the most arduous challenges of climate diplomacy of the XXI century due to a wealth of factors.
As concerns over environmental-related issues have globally increased, the attention has shifted to the world’s second-largest economy, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and the role played in responding to such problems over the last decades. This is because one ofChina’s most apparent paradoxes is to be bothone of the world’s most polluted regionsand theworld’s largest investor in renewable energy.
On the one hand, as one of the world’s most polluted countries,China is responsible for almost 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is mainly due to its heavy reliance on coal as a fuel.Coal consumptionis currently accounting fornearly 58% of China’s energy mix. However, the need to boost the economy has led the government in the past to prefer this energy source over others to swiftly support the country’s economic growth momentum. The central government has engaged in preventing energy from becoming an obstacle undermining economic and social stability by making energy security the premise to achieve the country’s strategic goal of quadrupling its gross domestic product (GDP) from 2000 to 2020.
On the other hand, China is also the world’slargest investor in renewable energyand a key exporter of clean energy technology in the world. Its boost in the use of renewable energy has started since the world’s financial crisis and from that moment on renewables were to be considered a strategically important industry for the country.
The share of renewable energy in China’s energy mix has gradually increased over the last decade: from 13% in 2010 to almost 16% in 2020. China currently has the world’s largest installed capacity of hydro, solar, and wind power: in 2019,renewable sources provided 26% of its electricity generation, with solar and wind combined having more capacity than hydropower, but with most of the remainder provided by coal power plants.
Chinese concerns over energy security have affected both the national economy and the environmentdue to the heavy reliance on coal and oil imports and, in the view of protecting national interests, they have inevitably influenced international relations and the creation of alliances. However, with the increasing use of renewables and the consequent diversification of domestic supply, countries like China have more opportunities of achieving energy independence thus having greater energy security and more power in energy-related decision-making.
It’s significantthe role of the international community in China’s transition to a low-carbon economy: over the years, with pressuring demands, it has urged the country to engage in both domestic and international greener initiatives, as, since the early 2000s, the international community accused China of not taking more responsibility for climate change considering its fast-growing economy but also of impeding the achievement of an improved global agreement. The turning point wasthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change adopted in 2015which is evidence of China’s evolving role in the global collaboration to find a common solution, in which it has become an active participant and contributor.
During the COP21, China submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), in which promised to peak CO2 emissions by 2030, reduce the emissions of CO2 per unit of GDP by 60%-65% based on 2005 level by 2030 and increase the energy consumption of non-fossil fuels to approximately 20%. Addressing climate change internationally by reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and increasing the share of clean and renewable energy is in line with Chinese domestic concerns over environmental protection and public health.
The13th Five Year Plan(FYP) sets the goal ofreducing the CO2 emission per unit of GDP by 18%compared to the level of 2015 by 2020, thus committing to reducing CO2 intensity per unit of GDP by at least 40% from its 2005 level, as stated in China’s pledge at COP21 to lower carbon emissions by 60- 65% per unit of GDP compared to 2005 level and peak its carbon emissions by 2030. By 2020, China had cut carbon intensity by 18.4% compared with 2015 and by more than 45% compared with 2005, putting it on course to meet its target as well as its Paris pledge.
However, the temporary stall in the country’s economy caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in the first quarter of the year led China to “dirty” industries and investments to revive its economy, whose outputs may have risen the amount of CO2 produced per unit of GDP growth over the rest of the year. During the Climate Ambition Summit, China announced its latest goal in climate action by pledging to reachcarbon neutrality by 2060, which could be a tipping point in the global fight against climate change.
Nonetheless, with the current energy mix and development model, China may have no problem in capping its carbon emission by 2030 but its efforts may not be enough to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, as stated by Jiang Xuefeng, vice direct at China National Petroleum Corp’s (CNPC) research institute.
The next Five-Year Plan will be critical for anaccelerated energy transitionin which renewables may be set to lead. China will have to change its economic and energy structure as soon and as intensely as possible.
In the meantime, in the global scene,the European Union has been spearheading the world race to sustainability in the three decades. Fully cognizant that – especially in the energy market – promoting sustainability through domestic policy acts is not per se sufficient, European policymakers have been strongly and consistently engaging their Chinese counterparts as one of the most arduous challenges to establish EU’s leadership in the global transition to green energy. Nonetheless, only modest and partial results have ensued from European efforts.
The noteworthy carbon footprint from a still largely carbon-fueled Chinese energy sector has unquestionably flagged the country’s unmatched burden on the global climate as a monumental challenge to be addressed multilaterally. It does not come as a surprise that the EU, which has been developing aleadership-by-examplemodel of climate policy since the Kyoto Protocol, has consequently been intensifying its ties with Xi Jinping’s establishment, earmarking substantial diplomatic and financial resources to influence Chinese energy policies both domestically and extra-jurisdictionally. However, unlike other traditionally ‘climate reluctant’ countries such as the United States, China has arguably representedthe single most challengingpiece de resistancefor EU’s environmental stewardshipin the global panorama for three main reasons.
First, the European Union hasnever been a historical energypartner to China. Numerous among EU’s foreign climate policies historically used to shift extra-European policy preferences closer to the Union’s position are indeed reliant on strong economic ties between the parties. De facto, the lack of Sino-European energetic relations has  preempted the Union from exerting any type of financial leverage on their Asiatic counterpart to pressure a move towards greener energy and away from fossil fuels.
Moreover, the Union has oftentimes relied on its own ambitious domestic policies to induce imitation within other jurisdictions throughpioneering leadership. In multilateral fora like the Conferences of the Parties (COP), European credibility in the field of energy sustainability has been based on an enviable internal record of forward-looking policies of energy efficiency and renewable energy growth (see for instance theEnergy Efficiency Directiveand theRenewable Energy Directive). The vacuum of energetic trade relations between the two global superpowers has drastically hindered the efficacy of EU’s leadership-based persuasion of its Asian counterpart.
Second, the PRC hashigh ‘climate power.‘ In other words, the Chinese present and future carbon emissions deriving from the energetic sector are leading global greenhouse gas emissions and are expected to continue on this trend unless large-scale, rapidly-deployed, and targeted investments into Renewable Energy occur. Therefore, China’s energy policy preferences posses the power to make or break worldwide aspirations for climate mitigation for the century, factor that automatically renders the country a top-tiered target for European foreign environmental policies given its impact compared to other climate reluctant countries.
Last, China haslow ‘climate interest.’ This value is usually defined in function of factors such as GDP per capita, vulnerability to the effects of global warming, and presence of a democratic system. Although booming, the Chinese economy is indeedstill largely considered to be ‘developing,’and sustainability concerns might not feature before economic or social amelioration in Xi’s agenda for the development of his country. Moreover, according to theGlobal Climate Risk indicator, China has not featured among the top 30 countries for exposition to the effects of global warming since 1990. Domestic incentives to tackle climate change by reducing energy-related carbon emissions in order to preserve national security are therefore minimal. Finally,The Economic Intelligence Unit’s 2020 Democracy Indexindicates that Chinese authoritarianism has alarmingly strengthened in the past few years, scoring a record low of institutional democracy in 2019 (see figure below). This entails that, although the global public opinion has become more sensitive to topics such as climate change and energy sustainability, the likelihood that such change of preferences in Chinese constituents actually engenders policy changes remains low.
Some might then wonder which prospects of success to promote greener energy production and consumption in the Asian superpower can the European Union possibly have. The simplest answer is that such prospects are nothing short of significant, based on the fact that China hashigh ‘climate capabilities.’ That is, unlike other environmentally inefficient economies with a sizeable carbon footprint such as India, the PRC’s economy has been steadily growing skyrocketing in the past three decades, hundreds of millions Chinese citizens have escaped poverty, and the country has experienced unprecedented levels of economic and financial expansion. Energy policy scholars Demetriou and Hadjistassou indeed claim thatChina today possesses the financial resources and technological know-how to scale down its coal-reliant energy production and transition to a low-carbon economic model.
The question is:can the European Union spark Chinese policymakers’ interest in complying with international agreementsandboost domestic political consensus behind a transition to low- or zero-carbon economy in the PRC?
The answer includes a record of mixed results.
The Union’s success in this endeavor through multilateral agreement has only been indirect. Leading agenda-setting activities in numerousmultilateral forafrom the Kyoto Protocol (KP) negotiations to the Paris Agreement, the EU has significantly contributed to shift initial position as a developing country with nonbinding Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to climate mitigation objectives in Kyoto to its first binding carbon abatement goals in Paris. Furthermore,in the Marrakesh Declaration, the Union brokered the inclusion to the KP of two paramount flexible mechanisms – namelyInternational Emissions Tradingand theClean Development Mechanism(CDM) – that shaped China’s aspirations and realization of carbon emissions reduction. Institutional commitments to carbon abatement have moreoverstabilized the market for decarbonized energy and power, decreasing the risk associated with these investments and increasing its large-scale accessibility. Increased accessibility also ensued from theEU-supported domestic carbon trading mechanism, which was developed thanks to a strong Sino-European bilateral dialogue born in 2016.
Sino-Europeanbilateral cooperationhas played a critical role in decarbonizing Chinese energy as well. On the one hand, the launch of bilateral dialogue platforms like theEU-China Energy Cooperation Platform(ECECP), know-how sharing partnership especially in the photovoltaic sector, and the integration of international carbon markets have contributed to the11,000-fold increase of green, photovoltaic powerto the Chinese electricity mix in the period 1990-2020. The ECECP objectives are ambitious, and aim to “reduc[e] costs [of green energy] by improving competition” (Clause 1.A) and creating alevel playing field for clean power enterprisesin both markets (Clause 16.4). In energy policy scholarXiaohua’s analysis, it would seem that this cooperation has indeed paid off as Chinese energy decarbonization has been reportedly driven by foreign investments, and mainly by  “the strong support policies of the EU member states” aimed at reducing energy accessibility barriers. By making clean energy more accessible and affordable, the European Union has undoubtedly contributed to the PRC’s climate neutrality aspirations.
On top of that, early data on the impact of European support toChina’s domestic Emission Trading System(ETS) are promising. Thanks to the European capacity-building resources devoted to its energy partner, China’s ETS isexpected“to expand to seven other sectors” in addition to coal-fueled power generation, hence becoming “theworld’s largest [ETS] by far, covering one-seventh of global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion.” Paired with increasing inwardForeign Direct Investmentsin European clean energy enterprises from Chinese investors, the ETS has strongly affected the perceived importance of energy decarbonization in the PRC, and is on track to influence China’s long-term carbon footprint.
Finally, European policymakers also played a pivotal role in shaping thepublic debateon energy sustainability aspirations. In September 2020, European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyenstressed how a commitment tocarbon neutralityfrom the Chinese side would be essentialto maintain a level-field reciprocity in trade and energy partnerships in light of EU’s 2030 projections. In addition, EU officialshave disclosed that the European Union would have resorted to punitive carbon tariffslevied on Chinese imports, should China have not committed to discontinue financing to new coal-fueled power plants. Unexpected to many in Brussels, on September 22, 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping in factannounced the county’s commitment to achieve carbon neutralityby 2060. Needless to say, the expected consequences of this 2060 vision are unprecedented, and bound to influence Chinese energy policy for years to come.
For China, achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 reflects several ambitions. China’s greener initiatives provide opportunities to accelerate technology innovation and industrial upgrading, further strengthening its economy. With the aim of elevating people’s living standards, reducing emissions and pollution, avoiding natural disasters, and increasing energy independence are strongly related to secure health, quality of life, and well-being of its people. Thismight work towards solidifyingits leadership position among major countries as Chinawould seem to be pursuing a leadership-by-example modelin parallel to the EU. Following the PRC’s lead, Japan and Korea committed to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) goals, putting additional pressure on other large carbon emitters.
The 2060 goal is thelast of a series of long-term commitmentsthat China has intended to fulfil for the decarbonization of its economy. According to its pledge of capping its emissions by 2030, it is expected that China’s carbon emissions will reach a peak in 2025 and then enter a five-year plateau before starting to decline.
By 2035, the PRC’s per-capita GDP is meant to reach “moderately developed nations” standards. Chinese experts have interpreted moderately developed nations as having a per-capita GDP of US$20,000 to $40,000. China’s per-capita GDP was US$10,000 in 2019, meaning that the country will need to maintain steady real growth over the coming 15 years. Although the CO2 reduction potential in industry is enormous in China, energy-related carbon emissions are expected to continue increasing due to the growing energy demand drive by urbanization and industrialization,research shows. Moreover,early analyseson the topic indicate that theperceived tradeoff between the achievement of environmental targets and domestic economic welfarecritically reduces the willingness to buy decarbonized or low-carbon power in the country. Both national and international actors will be likely called to shape differently the public debate on energy sustainability in order to pursue the 2060 vision.
In this context, Sino-European relations can boost the domestic momentum towards energy sustainability by increasing bilateral cooperation in order to signal market confidence for private financing in the cleantech sector. In addition, the Union could invest in job creation within the clean energy industry with the goal of both debunking the aforementioned ‘welfare-sustainability tradeoff’ in the country and make clean energy and power more affordable for domestic consumers  – hence enticing a demand-driven energy decarbonization.
Provided acts will follow word, the announcement that China wants to be carbon neutral by 2060 could become a tipping point in the fight against climate change.
China’s 2060 pledge moves the international community closer to achieving the Paris Agreement goal of holding global warming to below 2°C. However,the countryhas not yet disclosed a detailed plan for reaching this incredible milestone by 2060. Clarifications are expected to be included in China’s updated NDC ahead of the COP26 in November 2021, in the 14thFYP, and in the 2035 vision document that the government is also currently drafting.
China is more likely to be at the beginning of a policy process, as the lack of detail emerged from other significant political documents, in the communique following the fifth plenum of the Communist Party’s 19th Central Committee, issued in late October 2020.
However, what emerges is that “greening” the economy may not be among China’s urgent priorities, but more “innovating” and “securing” the domestic welfare. In particular, the PRC’s sustainability drive of the past years responds also to non-sustainability strategic priorities, such as the need to overcome structural weaknesses ofindigenous energy availabilityandenergy reliance.
Nonetheless, China has successfully proved in the past to be able to fulfil essential sustainable commitmentsthough large-scale mobilization of financial resources,an example of which being the goal to resolve extreme poverty. This worldwide problem was addressed in the domestic boundaries through targeted poverty alleviation efforts.
While being provided with adequate financial resources and geopolitical partnerships, the People’s Republic of China might encounter structural and domestic challenges to the transition of a low-carbon economy ranging from economic welfare concerns to technological know-how shortages. The next decade will therefore prove crucial in shaping China’s future of energy sustainability.","January 22, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-chinas-energy-sustainability-the-2060-vision-and-the-eu/,Maria Paola Violi,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
[Analysis] EU-China Agreement on Investment: Impact on the Western Balkans,"The European Union shares with the Western Balkans countries a long-term relationship. A partnership that is expected to eventually culminate in the accession of the “Western Balkans 6” to the EU. Meanwhile, the EU seemed to perceive the growingChinese activism in the Balkans – Europe’s backyard – as a challenge. Therefore, the news of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in December 2020 may come as a surprise. Even more so since, in March 2019, the EU published astrategic outlook paperlabelling China a “systemic rival”.
And yet, on December 30, 2020, the EU and China signed abilateral agreement on investments, after 7-year long negotiations. This raises two questions. Firstly, what prompted the EU to overcome its hesitancy to engage with China? Secondly, is this Agreement potentially good news for the Western Balkans? In order to answer these questions, let’s consider how this threefold-relation started.
The European Union and the Western Balkans betrothed themselves since the 2003 Thessaloniki Summit. In thedeclaration, the “Western Balkans 6” were officially recognized as potential candidates for EU accession. The region that had beena pillar of Euro-Atlantic securitysince the ’50s, and that caused so many headaches in Brussels in the ’90s, was now bound to full membership.
Since then, the European Union has become theprimary investor in the Western Balkans. Starting from 2007 the EU has supplied technical and financial support to the region through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance. In the 2007-2020 period,the EU has supplied some €23 billionto the region for political and economic reforms.
In February 2020, the EU reiterated its commitment to enlargement through apublic announcementof the Commission. And the feeling appears to be mutual, according to anInternational Republican Institutes’ poll in summer2020. When asked what would they vote if a referendum to join the European Union were to be held today, a vast majority of interviewees said yes.
But the truth is that European accession comes with strings attached. Candidate-members must show full adherence to EU standards, rules, and values at the institutional, economic, and administrative level. Furthermore, in order to foster governance reform, European financing is heavily conditional. Finally, it may be true that the EU is the leading trade partner for the Western Balkans. In fact, it accounts for almost 70% of the region’s total trade. Butthe Western Balkans’ share of overall EU trade is only 1.4%.
This is where China came into play, dressed in a suit, shining shoes, and carrying a suitcase full of dollars. And these dollars, in the form of state-to-state loans, do not demand transparency, accountability nor market orientation. It appears clear that China does not intend to play gooseberry. Quite on the contrary, it has its own agenda when it comes to the Western Balkans. An agenda that, as it is widely known, takes primarily the form of the Belt & Road Initiative.
In the past few years, China has invested heavily in the region. The most widely-known example is the 1.3 billion$ investment in theBar-Boljare Motorway, in Montenegro. But China has also ramped up its foreign direct investments in Serbia. As of 2018, it wasthe second-largest investor in the country. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, China has granted a1.1 billion$ loan for two coal plants. The Western Balkans countries, for their part, readily accepted the Chinese generosity. After all, they are developing economies that crave foreign investments.
But this should not lead to the conclusion that China has an overwhelming interest in the Western Balkans as such. On the contrary, it seems thatChina’s interest in the Western Balkans relates primarily to its proximity to the EU. It would thus appear that Beijing has individuated in Eastern European countries its bridgehead to Western Europe and its markets.
As expected, Europe did not receive well this perceived intrusion. In her State of the Union speech, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen included a weighty remark. She affirmed that “the Western Balkans are part of Europe – and not just a stopover on the Silk Road“. An emotional way of saying that the EU is well aware of theChinese growing competition in the Balkans.
It appears clear that the EU and China were at loggerheads over the Western Balkans. More generally,the EU had toughened up its stance on China. The reasons for contrast were manifold. A major reason for concern was increasing authoritarianism under Xi Jinping, of course. But under the economic perspective, the perceived asymmetric openness and transparency towards China was even more worrisome.
The suspicion towards China even caused some attrition between the EU Member States. When, in March 2019, Italy signed a Memorandum of Understanding,the Guardiancalled the deal “controversial”.The US immediately warned Italy against China. Both German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron confirmed that they would only deal with Chinathrough EU institutions.
Yet, the EU-China negotiations – started 7 years ago – gained momentum since 2019, whenMacron met Xi Jinping to strengthen ties. Ten meetings were held in 2020 alone. The question is: what was the EU trying to accomplish by abandoning its tough posture towards China? The answers are essentially two.
First of all, business is business. According to anISPI analysis, in the first 10 months of 2020, the volume of EU-China exchanges was €477 billion. Two times the GDP of Greece, or equal to that of Argentina. And it has raised by 2.2% in the past year. But theEU trade deficit towards Chinawas €164 billion in 2019. In addition to that,Western investors do not feel treated fairly in the Chinese market. Both issues need to be addressed.
But this does not diminish the relevance of the second, more strategic, explanation. In fact, the EU is also, and above all, a union of values. It can be argued that EU leaders figured that engaging with China is a better way to get a say in its governance, rather than marginalising it. In other words, it’s more likely to get China to commit to EU standards with a carrot than a stick.
So, what does the EU-China Agreement entail?
First of all, it will allow unprecedented access to the Chinese market for European investors. In particular, quantitative restrictions, equity caps, or joint venture requirements will be eliminated. Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, tweeted: “This deal will give European businesses a major boost in one of the world’s biggest and fastest growing markets“. This should help rebalance the trade relationship between the EU and China.
Secondly, and possibly most importantly, is the so-called “level playing field” pillar. It measures and guarantees the safeguard of free and fair competition. In fact, under the Agreement’s provisions,China will no longer be able to prohibit access or introduce discriminatory practices. The accord also lays down clear rules on Chinese state-owned enterprises and transparency of subsidies. Furthermore, it prohibits forced technology transfers and other distortive practices.
Thirdly, the Agreement binds the parties into a values-based investment relationship, underpinned by sustainable development principles. This is a great accomplishment, considering howChina has discarded environmental issuesin the past. Beijing has committed to effectively implement the Paris agreement and toban forced labour. Plus, it has announced the intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
The final novelty is that the Agreement includes an enforcement mechanism. Effective implementation of the provisions will be monitored at the level of Executive Vice President of the EU, and Vice Premier of China.
To be sure, the European Union and China represent two completely different models. The first made the rule of law, human rights and macro-economic stability its core values. The other finds in economic and geopolitical expansion its reason of being but lacks transparency and accountability. But their interests over the Western Balkans do not necessarily have to overlap, nor collide.
First of all, a recentClingendael reporthas pointed out that “the Chinese business-first approach, revolving mainly around objectives of economic investment and development, can by no means be compared to the scope, depth, and level of ambition of what the EU seeks to accomplish in the region”. Furthermore,increased connectivity with Europeis one of the core strategic motives of Chinese activism in the Western Balkans. Therefore, it would not be reasonable to think that China would intentionally derail their process of EU integration.
Secondly, the ongoing pandemic crisis isan occasion for Europe to put its China policy on a more open, accountable, and values-based footing. Thestatementby the European Commission President von der Leyen after the Agreement was signed confirms that this is, in fact, the core idea. She said: “Today‘s agreement is an important landmark in our relationship with China and for our values-based trade agenda. […] It will commit China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency, and non-discrimination”.
Standing firm on European values is the only way to achieve more than financial gains from cooperating with China. Getting Beijing “to behave” is the only way to not disrupt the European path of the Balkans.
As stated above, China and the EU have radically different interests in the Western Balkans. The EU is seeking fellow democracies to include as full-fledged members of a supranational project. China, instead, is merely committed to the Balkans from an economic perspective. The region, in fact, craves two things that Beijing can easily produce:infrastructural modernization (through the BRI) and foreign capitals.
Stemming from this realization, the EU and China can agree on limiting their respective role in the Balkans. As noted by anIISS observer: “the European Development Banks […] face a difficult decision. They do not want to lend for projects that they judge unaffordable, but neither do they want Western Balkan governments to finance these projects with Chinese loans.”
The reason for this dilemma what that China would not only impose a heavy financial burden. The Chinese model of investment would also involveanti-competitive procurement, heighten the risk of corruption, and facilitate the transfer of wealth from Europe to China.
But, as stated before, through the Agreement Europe can put in place mechanisms to control Chinese economic practices. The EU could exploit this advantage to oversee the respect of transparency and accountability in its prospective members. Meanwhile, it could focus its energies and resources on giving momentum to the political reforms necessary for accession,especially democracy-wise.
Apart from fostering corruption, Chinese investment in the Balkans was problematic also from the perspective of sustainable development.
From the environmental point of view, the construction of a BRI-related highway has disrupted the Tara river, Montenegro. AnNGOand aUNESCO missionhave found that the natural site might be ruined beyond repair.
From the energy perspective, as remarked above, China is financing coal plants in the region. As Western Balkans countries are bound to theEnergy Community Treaty, they must reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. An EU-funded report has already defined the coal plants as “unacceptable from a climate point of view“.
Better coordination, and the respect of EU values in the Balkans, is the highroad for avoiding these issues. Once again, the EU-China Agreement comes into relevance. In fact, it creates a working group to follow the implementation of sustainable development-related matters.","February 09, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/eu-china-agreement-on-investment/,Shary Mitidieri,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"Portugal Takes Leadership of the EU Council, and the EU in New Directions","Portugalentered 2021 by taking its turn of Presidency of the Council of theEuropean Union. This marks the fourth time that Portugal leads the Council – the last time was in 2007. Upon this new term, Portugal is in a unique position; its Presidency arrives at a crucial time for the European Union. Entering a new post-Brexit phase, Portugal will help navigate the EU in a more enhanced multilateral direction. Furthermore, Portugal accompanies the EU as it enters a new phase inCOVID-19management, where cross-national vaccine rollout becomes a priority.
With its newpresidential programme, Portugal vows its commitment to ensure the EU’s ability to accommodate new circumstances posed by areas of health, development, and international relations. This is marked by the motto:
‘Time to deliver: for a fair, green and digital recovery’
Underpinning Portugal’s agenda for its six-month term leading the EU Council are three initiatives. The first concernseconomic recovery, focusing on climate and digital transitions. This principally entails the restoration of Europe’s economy, hit hard by COVID-19. Such restoration will be accompanied by digitalization. This includes the venture into a digital economy, digital development, and devolved digitalization to national and municipal governments. The focus on digitalization is pre-empted by a focus on sustainability. Initiatives for economic recovery are underpinned bythe need for a decarbonised economic model. With this, Portugal promises to actuate theEuropean Green Deal– a plan of action that aims to make the EU climate neutral by 2050.
Portugal’s second priority lies in implementing the above-mentioned climate and digital transitions through theEuropean Pillar of Social Rights. ThePillarfocuses on delivering equality and social protections across the EU’s 27 member states. While, delivering economic recovery and climate action, Portugal will maintain a social model that ensures no one gets left behind. Its policy of social equality therefore includes supporting the creation of aEuropean Health Union; an initiative to ensure healthcare in Europe is responsive, accessible and innovative. As its term only lasts until June, Portugal’s role in the development of the Health Union will centre on fast and accessible COVID-19 vaccination across the EU and beyond.
Finally,Portugal‘s Presidency promises to lead the European Union into becominga global player with strategic autonomy.Portugal hopes to enact the EU’s established plans for enhanced global relations. This will include expanding into regions such as Latin America, Africa and Asia, as well as renewing relations with partners like theUSandUK. Feeding into the goal of European economic recovery, Portugal will accompany the development of the EU’s various global trade agreements and investments. Such arrangements will be made with respect to the newly emphasised European goal of strategic autonomy in the international arena. Following the UK’s departure, as well as weakened relations with the US underDonald Trump, the EU is adopting a position of command in the world.
First and foremost isthe need for economic recovery. At apress conferencewith Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Prime Minister António Costa explained Portugal’s plans to execute thearrangementsfor economic recovery overseen by the previous Presidency, i.e.Germany. The focus is now on distributing national funds for EU member-states to repair impediments, caused by COVID-19, to their economies. This involves the implementation of the2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework(MFF), including the EU Next Generation Instrument.€1824.3 billionis available for programmes including ‘single market, innovation and digital’ and ‘cohesion, resilience and values’. The mechanisms therefore intend to achieve COVID-19 recovery, whilst focusing onto climate and digital initiatives to strengthen the economy against future challenges.
Significant attention is placed on digital transformations – in businesses, the financial sector, and climate solutions. Digital transformations in climate solutions are tied to the Council’s mission statement of a sustainable, carbon neutral economy. Each initiative therefore contributes to European ambitions of global leadership in managing the digital sector and climate change. This is significant in an era of increasing reliance on digital technology and global governments’ acceleration in tackling climate change. This entails a longer-term transition than the urgency posed by COVID-19 and instant shift in EU membership following Brexit. However, Portugal’s involvement in boosting digital and climate strategies will associate it with a landmark transition in EU capacity.
While Portugal’s priorities lie in promoting digitalization to restore Europe’s economy, it also stresses digital regulation. Controls on large technology companies based and operating in Europe are relevant on the presidential agenda. Portugal vowed to accelerate negotiations for both theDigital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Between them, the Acts will create greater protections for users of technology platforms, such as Google and Amazon. They will also increase competition in the technology market. The Digital Markets Act is reflective ofPortugal’s own rise in technology businesses. The government has made numerous investments available to smaller technology companies, allowing them to break into the technology market.
It should be noted that Portugal is still recovering from its 2010-2014 national financial crisis. COVID-19 has slowed down this recovery. Its influence in managing European economic recovery will therefore accompany its own economic needs. This includes domestic needs, as well as those needs and issues that arise from its relative small size and limited strength, therefore also being an example for similar countries. Although the unique circumstances posed by COVID-19 mean that the majority of EU nations currently share common economic needs, the latter still vary. One example is Portugal’s need to sustain its tourist industry.
Portugal has recently experienced a national surge in COVID-19 cases. The country is now in lockdown as its health system struggles. Its economy has also been negatively impacted. Therefore, in discussions surrounding COVID-19 management, Portugal has also made its own national interests clear, one of which isthe need to recover tourism. In 2018, tourism accounted for8% of Portugal’s GVA. As one of the countries which thrives on tourism more than others, Portugal has expressed greater considerations of vaccine certification, to ensure increased, yet safe, travel. This moves such considerations further up the EU agenda to restore the European tourist industry – a key step in alleviating the dire circumstances posed by the pandemic.
The EUCOVID-19 vaccination strategyoutlines the necessity to ensure ‘equitable and affordable’ access to vaccines. Portugal’s recognition, in its programme, of cross-national differentiation in resources and capacities mean its involvement in this phase of COVID-19 management will be beneficial to small and medium sized EU members like itself. Upholding the social awareness pillar, Portugal is prioritized with ensuring vaccine accessibility for all members. This, in turn, will contribute to socio-economic recovery in all member-states. The vaccination strategy, underlined with a rhetoric of social fairness, will be Portugal’s primary contribution to the development of the European Health Union – a mission to improve future responses to similar public health threats.
Portugal’s programme for leadership of the Council lists the global EU partnerships it hopes to accelerate. During its term, the emphasis is on deepening relations with the East. At the introductory press conference, Prime Minister Costa noted the EU’sComprehensive Agreement on Investment with China. The Agreement aims to open up China’s market, granting equal access to European companies and setting “a new basis” for the EU’s relationship with China. This is also intends to “inspire a relationship with India”. Currently, the focus is on the upcomingEU-India Summitin May. The Summit aims to further the EU’s trade and investment with India.
Portuguese representatives have highlighted the significance of forthcoming EU relations with India. Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silver highlighted that EU relations with India will create a“geopolitical equilibrium”, a statement which complementsEU ambitions of fair global trade. Portugal’s colonial historic ties to India, may still hold significance in how Portugal conducts European trade policies. In this particular instance, it will be up to Portugal to approach India from a position of equilibrium.
Attention is also brought to the EU’s impending relations with the US under Joe Biden. These have been regarded asrestoration effortstoward a dampened relationship caused by Donald Trump. The EU has made clear its mission to re-start cooperative relations with the US in several areas. With Portugal helping to oversee this renewed cooperation, it is presented with the opportunity to stress its own national priorities, such as securinggreater export trade to the US.
Overall, Portugal will help expand the EU’s global presence as it enters its new phase of strategic autonomy. The EU is regarded as a coherent international actor, with many of its foreign policy functions delegated by member states to its core instruments, one of which is the Council (Aggestam, 2012). Portugal’s responsibility, as leader of the Council, will be to: a) maintain this internal coherence, and b) ensure it translates to the world stage, where Portugal recognizes the need for the EU’s position to remain strong.
A six-month term is a short period for Portugal to spearhead the implementation of several developments intended to advance European health, economy and international standing. Many of the initiatives in its programme will have medium to long-term implications. This is especially true for the Council’s international aspirations, however domestic security matters are compelling as well. Portugal has vowed to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination, notwithstanding, the dispersion and responsiveness of this process will show comprehensive effects on European health and economy much later than June. Nonetheless, its participation in such developments will cast it positively, as a nation who helped navigate landmark EU initiatives, like the European Health Union.
EU initiatives concerning health and economy, especially where common environmental circumstances are considered, entail multilateral governance. This governance will formally require the consensus of all members. Portugal’s Presidency of the Council is therefore fitting at this point, as a country with diplomatic strength, able to maintain political cohesion(Dias, 2021). Other member states like Cyprus havevoiced their confidencein Portugal; its relative size and strength mean it will appease all member-states, instead of advancing a hidden agenda.
The contribution Portugal can provide to this cross-national governance will also demonstrate its loyalty to the EU framework. This is important in light of renewed discourse on EU membership.Portugal itself has exhibited Euroscepticism amid the European debt crisis. However, it has demonstrated a strengthened position during its inauguration period in the Council Presidency.Referring to Portugal’s trio-presidency with Germany and Slovenia, Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva stated that the trio’s priorities “match perfectly” and they “see the European project in a very similar fashion”. In line with this sentiment, Portugal’s leadership of the Council, as the EU turns a page following the UK’s departure, ultimately strengthens its relation to the Union.

President Biden’s Environmental Policy: Promising or Pitiful?,"In the wake of a catastrophic year, nations and individuals have been forced to reassess where their priorities lie in lifestyle and policy. Having to sit at home has made many of us reconsider our previous direction, contemplating how much we can consider the fast-paced action of international, globalised life as progress. Some of these 21stcentury tensions erupted over the course of last year, in particular in theUnited States, this including theBlack Lives Matterprotests, thevoting out of President Trump, and the election of Joseph R. Biden as 46th President of the United States.
Against the backdrop of these human concerns, 2020 also brought on an onslaught of environmental disasters: with wildfires engulfing large parts of Australia and Los Angeles and heavier rainfall causing thousands of deaths via monsoons, typhoons and flash floods in Russia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, China, the Philippines, Myanmar, Nepal, and, unfortunately, many more (a complete list of environmental disasters over 2020 can be foundhere). Many are frustrated with the lack of environmental concern in current US politics, which was exacerbated by the election of Trump in 2016 and his immediate departure from the 2014 Paris Climate Agreement.With the end of Trump’s administration, how willPresident Bidendiffer from his predecessor?
Biden’s first day in office has alreadypromised a momentous change of tide: the administration plans to re-join the Paris Climate Accords and revoke the permit for theKeystone XL Pipeline, a proposed oil pipeline which would have ran from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. He has promised to support federal government scientists who have previously been side-lined by a political atmosphere of climate change denial, regulate methane emissions and join the global movement to end the use of warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
These immediate changes, though they are significant in the shadow of Trump’s environmental neglect, largely replicate President Obama’s environmental efforts. Newer policy changes include theGreen New Deal, which Biden has declared his support for on his official website, and a promise to achieve100% clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.These economic policies have the potential to change the landscape of the USA’s employment, industrial and economic landscape, however, despite theirbipartisan support from the public, conservative lawmakers and legislators will likely serve as a significant barrier to Biden’s plans. If the proposed plans are successful, however, Bill Hare, a member of theClimate Action Tracker(a monitor of the world’s carbon cutting efforts) has said:
“With Biden’s election, China, the USA , EU, Japan, South Korea – two thirds of the world economy and over 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions – would have [commitments toward reaching] net zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century”.
Much of this progress is dependent on Biden’s ability and motivation to continue this climate agenda. Political appointments such as Michael Regan, a graduate of environmental and earth science with a dedicated employment history in the field, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that there is an undeniable change in priority, socially and politically, for the US. This is a vital change asthe US is historically the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, responsible for 27% of global warming,more than any other country in the world. This is according to the World Resources Institute analysis, which found that from 1850 to 2011, the US emitted more carbon dioxide than all other countries: all of the nations of the European Union combined fell at 26% total, andChina produced 11%.
Though the country is responsible for a salient chunk of the current climate landscape, Biden’s priorities are also being affected by thenational situationhe has inherited from Trump. Biden’s preference for science, whilst it is vitally applicable to the environmental crisis, is also essential for cutting down the US’ Covid-19 cases. Biden has tied theCovid-19recovery to the economy:
“If we act now our economy will be stronger in both the short- and long-run,” he said. “That’s what economists left, right and centre are telling us.”
The central facet of Biden’s plan to address the Covid-19 recovery is a $1.9tn relief package called theAmerican Rescue Plan, which includes $1,400 direct payments, more generous unemployment benefits and billions for a national vaccination program.He has outlined not just a pro-science stance, but also a pro-union oneas he pushes towards the restoration of collective bargaining powers and a $15 hourly minimum wage. This economic recovery push is also substantiated by an extension on the federal pause on evictions, as well as a Covid-19 food programme targeting children and families who would have previously been eligible for free school meals.
All of these executive orders show an administration full of action and eager to invest into economy-boosting state-funded programmes. Combined with a epistemologically-minded agenda, Biden’s current plans show significant promise for a progressive climate plan. However, any more radical advances are clearly being saved for after the pandemic so, looking forward from 2021, the US looks like it will change its tune on climate change demoralisation. Though there is a mountain of progress to be made, Biden’s administration appears to be pointing in the right direction. Watch this space.

Israel: Startling Success to the Detriment of Palestinians,"During crises, already existing issues tend to exacerbate. Covid-19 exposed how flawed our societies are: “the poor” became poorer and the “rich” became richer.In this context of inequality, it is not surprising that millions of Palestinians are willfully exposed to severe infection risks. In fact,Israelis reportedly denying them access to the vaccines.
Currently, only the Palestinians who live in Jerusalem are part of the Israeli vaccine distribution plan.The five million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank are excluded from the distribution program.Notwithstanding the fact that, in the West Bank, the Israeli settlers will instead receive the vaccine. This exposes, once again, what Amnesty International defines as the “institutionalised discrimination” perpetrated by the Israeli government.
Israel justifies this decision claiming that thePalestinian Authority (PA)did not formally nor informally request to be provided with vaccines. But even when it was the World Health Organisation (WHO) to informally demand the Israeli government to provide Palestinian health workers with vaccines,the response was negative. Pressures from human rights organisations led Israel to approve the shipment of 5.000 doses of vaccine to Palestinian health workers in February. An underwhelming quantity of vaccines, considering that there are five million Palestinians living in the occupied territories.
On one hand, the Israelis claim that, according to the Oslo accords of 1995, the distribution of vaccines in the West Bank and Gaza is a responsibility of the Palestinian Authority.
Former Israeli prime ministerYitzhak Rabinand Palestine Liberation Organisation ChairmanYasser Arafatsigned theOslo accords. The contended lands were divided into area “A”, “B”, and “C”. They also recognised a Palestinian interim government.The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was the representative of Palestinians and the PLO recognised the state of Israel. This should have been a five-year transition period towards the recognition of a Palestinian state. However, the diplomatic relationship between the two partiesdegraded throughout time. The creation of a Palestinian state did not take place as planned, and the land distribution has significantly changed.
It is therefore farfetched to use the Oslo accords as a justification of Israel’s choices. Not only because Israel itself did not respect them, but also because the current Prime Minister Netanyahu, in 2001, expressed his disagreement with the accords. In a leaked video, he in fact stated:“I de facto put an end to the Oslo Accords.”
TheFourth Geneva conventionis one of the four treaties of the Geneva Conventions. It aims at assuring humanitarian aid to civilian in war zones and occupied territories.
Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that
“To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty ofensuring and maintaining, […]public health and hygienein the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics”.
Israel signed and ratified the treaty in 1951.Israel has, therefore, legally committed to provide the inhabitants of the occupied territories Gaza and West Bank with vaccines.
The treaties of the Geneva conventions are peremptory  laws (jus cogens). As peremptory law is imperative, no derogation is possible. In the case of a conflict with another treaty, the latter becomes void and terminates. This further confirms that, even if the Oslo accords were still valid as written and signed in 1995, they would not be legally enforceable anymore, because of the presence of the Geneva conventions.
TheCOVAX programme, lead by the WHO, will provide two million doses of vaccines. The Palestinian Authority confirmed the purchase of two million doses of the Oxford\AstraZeneca vaccine, which will arrive between late February and early March.But they will only be enough to inoculate one million people.As two doses of the vaccine need to be inoculated for it to be effective, two million doses are still needed to reach herd immunity.
Israel received global attention and praise for the speed at which it distributed the vaccines. It vaccinated more than20 percentof its citizens and plans to vaccine every citizen over sixteen by late March. This suggests that Israel has all the means to “ensure and maintain public health in the occupied territories”.
This also suggests that is deliberately excluding Palestinians from the process. For sure, the Palestinian Authority is working to provide Palestinians with vaccines.But this should not exempt Israel from its duty, descending from international law.

US Sanctions on the ICC: A Symptomatic Approach Towards International Law,"On September 2, 2020, former US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced US economic sanctions on the International Criminal Court’s Prosecutor, the Gambian lawyer Ms. Fatou Bensouda, and its official Phakiso Mochochoko. These measures are due to the US’s objection to the Prosecutor’s intention to start a proceeding concerningpotential crimes perpetrated by American officialsinAfghanistan.
The failure to recognize the international criminal jurisdiction highlighted by these economic measures was a part ofTrump’s approach to international relations,standing back from multilateralism in favour of a unilateral approach. However, this attitude towards the ICC only embodies the extreme version of a relationship that has always been controversial since the set up of the Court.
The reality of international political interests has always represented a sizeable hurdle in theforgingofa rule-based international criminal jurisdiction, which, however, remains bound to the willingness of states.
TheUS Government’s decision to impose sanctions on the Hague-based Court’s officials, wasnot unexpected. In fact, they came after the previous13928 Executive Orderissued in June 2020 authorizing other economic sanctions on ICC officials, aimed at persuading the Court to refrain from opening an investigation on alleged crimes committed by American officials during the Afghan War.
Former Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has called this aserious violation to American sovereignty, opposing on the grounds that there is no legitimacy to indict or investigate a non-member state, since the US did not ratify the Rome Statute setting up the Court in 1998. However, the ICC condemned the American measures, considering them an attempt to interfere with its independent jurisdiction and its right to address grave human rights violations as its Statutes set out.
Furthermore, the Court reaffirmed itsright to prosecute Afghanistan due to its membership of the ICC since 2003, which gives it the authority to investigate on its territory despite the nationality of the suspects. The unilateral measures of the Trump’s Administration were strongly condemned by theUnited Nations, especially by ICC Member States, including those very allies to Washington. As a result, a joint statement of 74 Members of the Hague-based Court, led byGermany, in support of the Court was unveiled on the occasion of the ICC Report to the General Assembly, this last November. The statement expressed:
“unwavering support for the Court as an independent and impartial judicial institution” and recalled “that the ICC is a court of last resort, which anchors a system of justice for serious international crimes rooted in national courts. National authorities have the primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute Rome Statute crimes. The ICC only steps in when States are unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out national proceedings”.
In the final remarks, they also noted:
“that sanctions are a tool to be used against those responsible for the most serious crimes,not against those seeking justice. Any attempt to undermine the independence of the Court should not be tolerated”.
The ICC’s Prosecutor, who was banned from entering the US’s territory, except when travelling to the UN’s Headquarter in New York, and whose American bank account has been frozen, also responded by saying that “We are a court of law, we do not do politics” and “We have no agenda other thanto honourably fulfil our mandate”.
Since the beginning, the American Government has encountered many hardships whilst deciding whether to commit itself or not to the Court.
FormerPresident Clintondecided to sign the Rome Statute in 1998 after tough negotiations. However, his successor,President Bush, withdrew the signature since their negotiated reservations to the treaty, claiming the exemption from the Court’s jurisdiction, were not accepted. A turnaround was registered during theObama Administration, which was characterized by a more cooperative approach towards the Hague-based Court. Evidence of this tendency was shown by the decision to vote in favour of the 2011 UN’s Resolution authorising an investigation intoLibya’s mass violations of human rights, and it cooperated in the arrest of a Congolese militia leader who was afterwards convicted for war crimes.
Nevertheless, this cooperation was ceased when Trump arrived in the White House, and his shift to a rather more unilateral approach to international relations at the expense of multilateralism. On the other hand, the ICC, since its constitution, also seemed to be trying to refrain from being involved in any investigation concerning great powers, and because of this, it has been strongly criticized by African countries which argued the extreme speed in handling African cases and blaming the Court for being overly focused on that region.
On his very first day as President of the United States of America,Joe Bidensigned 17 executive ordersincluding onesaimed at re-joining the Paris Agreementand the WHO, as promised during his electoral campaign. This suggests a willingness to undertake a new course towards multilateral actions in tackling global issues. As a result, it seems likely that sanctions on the ICC officials will be lifted. However, President Biden has not said much on the ICC yet.
Thus, it is important to recall thatthe International Criminal Court has long been considered a political threatby both the Democrats and the Republicans. Considering the political consequences that an investigation on American officials would have, it suggests a possibly cautious reconciliation. A shifting approach in the international jurisdiction would probably entail a long process and for now, other key priorities seem to be on Biden’s Agenda.","February 18, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/us-sanctions-on-the-icc-a-symptomatic-approach-towards-international-law/,Arianna Muro Pes,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
China ‘Re-Education’ Camps: Where Is The World?,"Discoveries of‘re-education’ campsfor Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang in China have been increasingly publicised in recent years.  The existence of these camps first gained widespread attention in 2017 when reports by media outlets and organisations, such asHuman Rights Watch, began exposing details surrounding these education camps, calling out China’s ruling Communist Party for alleged human rights abuses.
Since then, expanding witness accounts, undercover reports, and unearthed documents have contributed to growing evidence that mass human rights violations are indeed taking place in Xinjiang.The camps are, therefore, being alternatively labeled as concentration camps. As the evidence grows, so does the international political recognition of it. However, despite few, relatively minor, developments in international responses,world powers are generally turning a blind eye.
Brain-washing, sterilizations, abuse, torture, and even suspected killingsare among the experiences that former detainees of re-education camps in Xinjiang claim are taking place within the walls of confinement. Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang are subjected to this treatment, primarily Uyghur Muslims. The existence of these camps has been defended by Chinese officials, who maintain thatthey are designed to re-educate Muslims by taking them away from their supposed extremist ideals, and instead, re-align them with the views of Chinese Communist society. Witness accounts, however, indicate that these camps are centers of abuse.Recent reportsclaim that detainees are also being used for COVID-19 vaccine testing, organ harvesting, and biological weapon testing, while others are sent away to undertake forced labor.
There are two primary reasons why Muslim minorities are being persecuted in Xinjiang:1) They are perceived as extremists and deemed a terrorist threat.2) They are accused of having too many children and, therefore, not complying with China’s strict birth policies.
Both of these reasons are linked to one another. Muslims in Xinjiang having what is defined by national policy to be ‘too many’ children isassociated with breeding religious extremism. The regional context shows how previous conflicts between Muslim minorities and the Han Chinese majority have led to Xinjiang Muslims being framed as extremists, separatists, and terrorists – an overall threat to the dominant ideals of the Chinese Communist Party. Combined with rising evidence that it is primarily Muslim minorities who are persecuted for violations of the national birth policy, it is clear that the Party is cracking down on Muslims through birth regulations to prevent them from procreating. Even those who have not violated any national policies are forcibly removed from cities across Xinjiang and placed in the camps.There are extensive efforts in place to reduce, or at least dilute, the Xinjiang minority populations, and, therefore, reduce the supposed extremist threat.
These efforts are not exclusive to China’s borders. Numerous cases have shown that Uyghurs who have been living abroad but had to return to China for reasons such as retrieving documents to establish residency elsewhere have also been forcibly detained once on Chinese territory. This is not enough to classify the issue as international, although it does extend beyond the boundaries of China’s efforts to reduce the Uyghur ethnicity.Such efforts have also been classified as prevention mechanisms to stop Uyghurs outside of China from revealing Xinjiang’s practices.
The UN definesgenocideas actions taken to destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group through killing, inflicting harm, and preventing births within the group.Many of the testimonies made by former detainees, as well as information provided by insider sources, categorizes the practices of China’s re-education camps as genocide.
Alegal claim was presented to the International Criminal Courtin 2020, positing that China was committing “crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity”. The claim was underpinned by “principles of command and superior responsibility”, highlighting China’s non-compliance with international law and calling for an international investigation. However, theICC has since rejected calls for an investigationon the grounds that China did not sign the Courts’Rome Statute, so the ICC, therefore, does not have jurisdiction to prosecute China for crimes enacted on its territory. The Office of the Prosecutor also responded to cases involving Uyghurs who were living abroad but brought back to China to be detained, ruling that these cases also do not qualify as crimes against humanity for deportation.
AUN human rights panelrevealed in 2018 that it had received reports that an estimated two million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities were held in internment camps in China whichconfirmed that the UN had prior knowledge that China was detaining minorities in Xinjiang and treating them as enemies of the state. Recently,39 countries at the UN’s human rights committeereiterated concern with China’s violation of human rights, calling for the re-education camps to be closed.Aninterview given by UN human rights lawyer Emma Reillydisclosed that the UN had known about the development of China’s re-education camps since 2013. Reilly went on to declare that UN officials were handing over the information of Uyghur dissidents who had spoken of the details of the persecutions to the UN Human Rights Council to China. As a consequence, Chinese officials would harass and detain the families of these dissidents who were still in Xinjiang. She alleged that in response to an internal case against the UN, she was tolda political relationship with China held priority over human rights principles. Reilly summarised this as UN compliance in what she deemed to be genocide. Currently, no further UN action has been taken against China.
The extent to which international organizations can enact theirResponsibility to Protect(R2P) is dependent on their definition of China’s practices. R2P establishes an international commitment by UN member states to end severe forms of violence and persecution, including genocide, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.Although the existence of re-education camps, and the vast accounts that come from them, already fulfill the criteria of genocide, it has not yet been internationally defined as such.
The decision to enact R2P complements the debate surrounding humanitarian intervention and sovereignty.Do international forces have grounds to interfere in China’s domestic affairs where violations of human rights are concerned, or would this violate China’s sovereignty?
The current UN and ICC responses suggest a reluctance to attach the label of ‘genocide’ so as to avoid the need to enact R2P. Based on Emma Reilly’s statements, the UN appears to consistently prioritize preserving stable political relations with China,and violating China’s sovereignty by undertaking extensive action to end its program against Xinjiang minorities would potentially destroy these relations.
Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming has statedthatWestern accusations that China is violating human rights are a “new cold war on China”. Such a statement serves as a wall of defense put up by China against Western interference in its domestic affairs. This interference is framed as the West cracking down on China’s alternative practices without just cause, ultimately serving to assert China’s dominance. AChina Daily article, written to debunk the alleged myths created by the West about Chinese practices in Xinjiang, points to the US as propelling these myths in order to realize “its ulterior political purpose”. The authors reiterate that human rights are used as an “excuse to wantonly interfere in China’s internal affairs”.
Even if a decision was made by the UN to intervene, there is little prospect that it would successfully cease the human rights violations taking place in Xinjiang.As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has the right to veto any Resolution taken against themand obstruct anyUN human rights mechanismsused against it, as it did in the past.

Remembering the Persecution of Homosexuals During the Nazi and Fascist Regimes,"Disclaimer:The intended purpose of thefollowing article is toraise awareness of the systematic persecution and execution of homosexuals during WWII. It is not the intention of the author or the organization to diminish the pain of other social groups affected by the Holocaust.
January 27th is the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a day dedicated to commemorating all the social groups that were murdered, persecuted, and stripped of any type of dignity. The group that was most notably targeted was the Jewish community – which lost two-thirds of its population- with an estimated death toll of 6 million people. Other targeted groups included Roma people, political opponents, people with disabilities, and homosexuals, amongst others. The death toll of the aforementioned groupscombined is 11 million.
In the last few decades, more attention has been given to theother social groupsthat were deported to concentration camps and then murdered. One particular group coined a new word to express the persecution and systematic extermination of its community during the Holocaust, the word is “Homocaust”. The expression is a combination of the terms “homosexual” and “holocaust”, and its use is sometimes controversial. Male homosexuals were the main target as sexual acts between two men were considered unlawful and depraved.Paragraph 175 of the German CriminalCode clearly stated that acts of “unnatural indecency” between men are grounds for imprisonment.What is peculiar about Paragraph 175 is that it came into force following the German Reunification in 1871. This means that within Germany, hostility against sexual minorities was not a new trendhowever,in 1935 Hitler decided toimproveparagraph 175, extending the grounds for imprisonment.
Although there were discussions about theintroduction of a law openly condemning homosexuality or homosexual actsin Italy, the decision was made to not include any reference to homosexuality in the “Codice Rocco” (the Italian Criminal Code).Having a law clearly referencing homosexuality meant acknowledging the existence of homosexuals in Italy. When deliberating for the exclusion of any clause condemning homosexual acts, the commission in charge of the redaction of the Codice Roccostated that “with luck and pride”, homosexuality was not common enough to justify the existence of such a law. Despite the lack of legislation, homosexuality was not condoned in Italy, but homosexuals were considered to be “instigators of public indecency”, and many were incarcerated for it.
Just like otherunwantedandundesiredgroups, homosexuals were sent to concentration camps. In the camps, the inmates had different patches that would categorize them.Male homosexuals were forced to wear a pink badge in the shape of a triangle. Lesbians were categorized as “asocial” and had to wear black badges. Further, pseudo-scientific experiments were carried out at the expense of homosexuals. The majority of these experiments were psychological and hormonal tests, designed to attempt to find acure for homosexuality.
The remembrance of this specific category is very different when exploring the two main countries responsible for the Holocaust. An important element to keep in mind is that homosexuality was not decriminalized at the end of the third Reich, nor ten years later, nor twenty. Paragraph 175 was reformed in Western Germany in 1969, but it was only voided after the reunification of East and West Germany in 1994. After 1945, various “communities of memory” were involved in the ever-growing process of commemorating a social memory. In the ‘70sand ‘80s, after the decriminalisation of homosexuality, queer movements in Germany started reclaiming their space in history.Only in the ‘90s did the Bundestag decide to recognise and invest in the creation of monuments remembering this forgotten group.
In Germany, from Frankfurt to Berlin, many visible monuments to remember the persecution of homosexuals during the Nazi regime can be found. However, the most well-known monument is in the country’s capital, Berlin, in Tiergarten park.
The memorial is a large, cubic-shaped, and imposing monument made of concrete. On one side, there is a small window that allows visitors to see a clip of a gay couple forever locked in a kiss.The contrast between the imposing geometrical structure and the intimate and tender film that can be seen on the inside is what makes this memorial so unique and well-thought-out.According to the creators of the monument, Elmgreen and Dragset, the memorial symbolizes the “character of a living organism subject to dynamic change rather than a static and final statement”.
In Frankfurt, another important monument dedicated to the remembrance of homosexuals persecuted during the Nazi regime can be found: theFrankfurter Engel(Angel of Frankfurt). This statue was the first memorial of its kind and is situated in the center of Klaus Mann’s square.
On the southern side of the Alps in Italy, the remembrance of the persecution of homosexuals is slightly different than in Germany. As previously mentioned, in Italy there was no law explicitly condemning homosexuality, however, three measures were taken. The first measure was apublic warning, demanding a stop to the unlawful acts, otherwise, serious measures would be taken. The second measure was theadmonition, which was similar to a house arrest, with a duration of up to two years. The third measure wasconfinement, which was internal exile. Usually, homosexuals wereexiled to the Tremiti Islands.
Despite the active participation of the fascist regime in the persecution of homosexuals,in Italy, the remembrance of these persecuted homosexuals is not particularly honored. The memorials for the persecutions are few and far between and the ones that do exist are not as elaborate as their German counterparts. In some cities like Bologna and Trieste, plaques with pink triangles have been installed either in cobblestone or outside institutional offices.
Arcigay is the main organization in Italy that is, and has been, fighting to shed light on the “homocaust”.The realization of the commemorative plaques is the result of their active advocacy with political institutions over the years.
Remembering the horrors of the Holocaust, in all of its facets, is a moral imperative and civic duty that must be carried out whether through an imposing monument, a plaque, or an online article.
The difference in remembering the persecution of homosexuals during the Nazi and Fascist regimes raises the following questions:

Navalny: Harbinger of Democracy or Flash in the Pan?,"The arrest ofAlexey Navalnyupon his return to Russia has triggered widespread protests. For many, they represent the first step towards democratization. This article, though, argues that things are more complicated. The first problem is that Navalny is a much more controversial figure than he seems. In fact, his idea of democracy might be very different from the Western concept of democracy. The second problem is less idiosyncratic and more strategic. Namely, the Russia regime seems willing to lock up Navalny for quite some time. And this alone, could leave protestors without a leader and without purpose.
DuringPresident Biden‘s inauguration, poet Amanda Gorman said that her country is “not broken, but simply unfinished“. The underlying meaning of that verse is that democracy is not a state; it is a process, and a lengthy one. For many, the pro-Navalny, pro-democracy protests in Russia are the first step in that process. The Guardian described the upheaval, triggered by Navalny’s detention, as a “tidal wave of contempt and disgust” towards a repressive regime.
In addition to that, it compared “courageous, charismatic, highly intelligent, witty and politically savvy” Navalny to the “charmless” Putin. The New York Times went even further, painting the picture of heroic protesters “braving bitter cold and attempts at intimidation“. In truth, these protests, which involved a large number of young people, do signal an increasing discomfort with the government. Without a doubt, it does take courage to facepolice violence and even, possibly, detention.
But are these marches the first domino falling? Are they the first sign that Putin’s grip on power is faltering, or mere “disorder” that will be repressed? At least two reasons, though, cast doubt on the possibility that democracy will prevail.
The first problem is thetepid reaction of Western leaders. For sure,the United States condemned the “harsh tactics”used against protesters, and Joe Biden’s incoming National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan,calledfor Navalny’s immediate release. The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyenstatedthat “detention of political opponents is against Russia’s international commitments”. But, reading between the lines, they were merely condemning police violence and arbitrary detentions.No leader questioned the legitimacy of the Russian regime itself.
On this basis,Bellingcat‘s Andrew Higgins said that the reaction to Navalny’s arrest was “utterly toothless”. Plus, he added that Russia does not care about sanctions. As a matter of fact, Putin seems less than impressed with the magnitude of the protests. The Kremlin Press Secretary, Dmitri Peskov, claimed thatthe size of demonstrations was largely overstated. Indeed, the40.000 protesters in Moscowpale in the face of a population of 12 million. In other words, the protests still seem far away from constituting a true mass movement.
Certainly, this is not the first time that Western actors seem paralyzed when confronted with baffling Russian behavior. After all, in “realpolitik” terms, this makes sense. Democracies are bound to theprinciple of non-interferencein the domestic affairs of foreign countries. Furthermore, Russia has significant economic and political ties with several European actors. Thus, as sanctions do not seem to work and overt support is off the table, the West has its hands tied.
A second issue could bethe figure of Alexei Navalny himself. For now, the global press seems to appreciate him. He has been called the “best hope for liberalization in Russia”. Charming, tall, good-looking and capable of using social media, Alexei Navalny has all it takes to appeal a vast public. And his poisoning in August 2020 made himmore popular than ever. In fact, a Levada poll showed that, in 2013,only 1% of interviewees would have voted for him. Now,20% of responders approve of him.
Despite this, his xenophobic, far-right sympathies could come back to haunt him. Navalny started his political career in the Russian United Democratic Party, Yabloko. In 2007,the Party expelled him due to his nationalist activities. He then went on to found the nationalist-oriented movement “The People”. In 2011, he founded the “Anti-Corruption Foundation“, mixing people of different backgrounds, including the far-right. He has indulged several times in the use of racial slurs.
In 2013, he participated in the Russian March, a parade uniting Russian nationalist groups.He has also endorsed a nationalist-led campaign called Stop “Feeding the Caucasus”. In addition to that,he supported the 2008 war against Georgiaand the annexation of Crimea in 2015. So, it may be true that Navalny has been breathing on the regime’s neck when it comes to corruption. But it seems that the prospected legal, lawful Russia should be for Russians only. Further, Navalny is a hound when it comes to unmasking the regime’s hypocrisy but, so far,lacks an organic political outlook. In short, it remainsunpredictablewhat the quality of a democracy represented by him would entail.
It may be predictable that in countries with no democratic history or culture of human rights, the “people’s choice” can often be a populistic choice. After all, in 2013,27% of the Russian people declared a deep concern about immigration. Thus, Navalny’s take on the issue is not that unpopular. But in a fragmented, complex, stratified society such as Russia’s, this comes at a price. As Navalny’s popularity grows, so do his critics. As of September 2020,50% of Levada interviewees declared that they disapprove of him.
Navalny may face some time in prison; three years and five months, at least. Will he become another Khodorkovsky? And, if so, how does he plan to maintain his political activity and visibility? Even for his supporters, a jailed leader may not constitute a winning horse. Sure, his arrest triggered protests all over the country. But, as stated above, their magnitude was not overly impressive. Furthermore, how long will it be before people go back to “business as usual”, in the face of repression?
Finally, the fact that the protests intersect democratic and pro-Navalny stances may discourage international support. The US or the EU may call for his release, but would they back him as a presidential candidate?It is not a given that they would perceive him as a better alternative to Putin in light of his nationalistic stance. Plus, active Western intervention would be a double-edged sword. Were they to pressure Russia, Putin may play the card of depicting Navalny as a Western “stooge“, a kind of rhetoric that still works on loyalists, and may further undermine Navalny’s popularity.
Without a doubt, none of what is stated above represents a justification for Navalny’s arrest or for the institutional harassment he suffered in the past. For example, in 2014, Navalny was sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement andRussia’s supreme court had to come into play to overturn the sentence. The European Court of Human Rights declared the case “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable“.
However, his opposition to Putin’s regime has come back to haunt him, time and time again. Since then, Russian authorities have launched three other legal cases against Navalny and in August 2020, he was poisoned with a nerve agent called Novichok. Unsurprisingly, Putin dismissed the accusations that he himself was to blame, even though only state-owned military laboratories can develop Novichok and it cannot be obtained by private individuals.This stronglyimplies that Russian authorities were behind the attack.
Apparently, this was still not enough. Navalny received treatment for the poisoning in Germany, and the moment he came back to Russia, the police arrested him. In fact, the Russian prison authority accused him ofbreaching the terms of the suspended sentence handed to him in 2014. Ironically, he would not need to leave the country if had he not been poisoned.
The outrage of the Russian people is more than understandable. Corruption, oppression, abuse of power, and even assassinations are all too common in Putin’s Russia. Butcan Navalny be the face of a renewed, democratic Russian Federation?For now, it seems unlikely, but still possible.

Child Marriage as a Contemporary Form of Slavery,"According to theUnited Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR), child marriage is any marriage whereby at least one of the parties is under 18 years of age. Most child marriages are forced marriages in which one or both of the parties have not expressed their free or full consent to enter the union. Child marriage is undisputedly a human rights violation and it disproportionately affects girls who are often married off to older men, sometimes as part of culture and tradition.
The causes of child marriage are as varied and multifarious as there are countries and cultures in the world. Some of the most common causes are poverty, conflict, lack of education, traditional patriarchal norms, and legal pluralism, among others. TheUnited Nationsreports that one in five girls is married before the age of 18 worldwide. This figure doubles in some of the world’s developing countries, where 40% of girls are married before age 18 and 12% before age 15.
Kenya’s Samburu communityis one example of where slavery and child marriage intersect. In the community, a beading ceremony is the main driver of child, early, and forced marriages. This ceremony is an abhorrent practice during which young, uncircumcised girls, as young as six, are given beads by an older, male ‘warrior’ suitor as a temporary engagement. This gives the man license to have sexual intercourse with the girl, as long as he keeps bringing gifts to the girl’s parents. Essentially, the man pays to rape the young girl, who becomes his sex slave, while her consent in the matter is never considered. As the man appeases the girl’s family, they build him a hut in the homestead, where he can access the girl whenever he desires.
Uncircumcised girls are still considered immature. Therefore, they are not allowed to get pregnant during this ‘engagement’ period despite the culture banning the use of any form of contraception. In the likely event that pregnancy does occur, the young girls are forced to go through traditional abortions or infanticides – both are physically and psychologically detrimental.
Article 1 of the 1926 Slavery Conventiondefines slavery as:
“[T]he status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to theright of ownershipare exercised”.
By definition,child marriages are considered forced marriages, i.e. they lack the consent of one of the parties. Asillustrated by the UN, “forced marriages are marriages in which one and/or both parties have not personally expressed their full and free consent to the union.A child marriage is considered to be a form of forced marriage, given that one and/or both parties have not expressed full, free and informed consent”.
Child marriages in many countries are often carried outwithout the genuine consent of the child. The major perpetrators of child marriage do not consider existing legislation or the limited exceptions usually provided for, which include special permission granted by the responsible legal authority or official written consent. Even with allegations of consent, children as young as 12 are too immature to give genuine, informed consent, disproving any claims to that effect.
From the onset of child marriages, there is aclear power difference between the non-consenting child and the much older adult party. In most cases, girl brides lose their right to self-actualization and are under the full ownership and control of their male partners. These girls are dominated and abused in multiple ways, such as physical violence from their husband and his relatives, sexual violence and rape, and excessive domestic labor, which, in some cases, amounts to servitude. Child marriage, therefore, encompasses a violation of numerous human rights, including the right to education, the right to enter marriage with free and full consent, freedom from servitude, and freedom of thought and expression.
The fact that most children have no say in entering or leaving these marriages freely has led contemporary slavery scholars to conclude that, in many cases, forced child marriage amounts to a contemporary form of slavery.Catherine Turnerof Anti-Slavery International provides three criteria to determine if child marriage amounts to slavery:
These criteria are often met in cases where the girls are younger than 16 and married off to someone significantly older, sometimes as old as 80. As highlighted by Kenya’s Samburu beading ceremony, the girl could be as young as six when the rights to her body are given to older men.
To illustrate a documented case in which child marriage could be described as slavery,VICE News interviewed a young child brideand her older husband in the Central African Republic. Twelve-year-old Benecia is married to 46-year-old Tchari Koibe. She has to take care of him and his ten-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.
In the video, Benicia explicitly admits she is in the marriage outside her volition and consent;
“I couldn’t refuse, I had to obey.I don’t want to stay here.”
Benicia has to undertake domestic chores, such as cooking, cleaning, and selling in the market each night. She expresses wanting to leave but not being able to, which could potentially lead to a lifetime of servitude and rape under Koibe’s domination.
Repugnantly, Koibe acknowledges that he hastotal control and ownership over Benicia, implied by his statement:
“When you marry a young woman, you can educate her in your own way”.
This statement illustrates not only his control over Benicia but also his awareness of that control. While watching the video, it is impossible to discount how child marriage could be regarded as a contemporary form of slavery, as defined by Catherine Turner’s three criteria. Unfortunately,Benicia is only one of the thousands of girls trapped in slavery in her country and all over the world.
Although this area of study is relatively novel, it is impossible to disregard the relationship between child, early, and forced marriages, and contemporary slavery.
Child marriage can no longer be treated lightly or simply discounted as being part of a given culture. Child marriage violates the human rights of the children involved and, as seen in the highlighted case, breaches one of the key, non-derogable international law norms: theprohibition of slavery.

"Russian Protest: Anti-Corruption, Pro-Navalny, and Violent","On Saturday 23 January, from Moscow to Sakhalin, tens of thousands of Russians went to the streets to show their support for Russia’s opposition leader, Aleksei Navalny, and to protest his unlawful detention. As a result, more than 3,000 demonstrators were arrested with almost one-third of the detainees being held in the capital. According to Reuters, almost 40,000 people took part in the demonstration in Moscow alone, although governmental figures only counted 4,000 demonstrators.
If Reuters’s numbers are confirmed, it would bethe biggest protest in Russian history. Daria Kozlova, a local activist, commented to TNGO that the support shown to Navalny should not be understood as being “pro-Navalny” as not everyone is a fan of the journalist and politician, but instead, “[they] are fighting for free speech, for democracy, [and] for fair and transparent trials”.
Navalny recently went back to his home countryafter being hospitalised in Germany for many months due to Novichok poisoning. One theory holds that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) tried to poison Navalny, although the everlasting president of the Kremlin,Vladimir Putin, has denied the allegations.
It isnot the first time Navalny has been hospitalised due to induced health complications. In 2019, he was poisoned while in jail, and in 2017 his sight was damaged because an attacker threw liquid antiseptic at him.  When asked about why he decided to return to Russia, Navalny said that he did not leave Russia by choice, but because he had to be flown to Germany for medical attention. He continued by saying that it would not be right for him to “call for a revolution from Berlin”.
Once he arrived in Moscow, Navalny was arrested by the police and has hadhis internationally-covered hearingonFebruary 2. The judicial hearing carried a dire sentence for the Russian politician, who now facesmore than two years in prison. The day after his detention, Navalny’s team released an investigative report describing a secret palace on the Black Sea built for the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
The investigation is very thorough and includes financial details, floor plans, and photos of the area and the various people involved. The main objective of the investigation was toreveal financial manipulation and the schemes put in place by Putinto protect himself and his closest circle. The report can be found invideo formaton YouTube and inwritten formaton an FBK-owned website, which includes photos and other documents. The report on the website is in Russian, and so is the video on YouTube, however, the almost-two-hour long video has English subtitles for international listeners.
The crowd of protesters was mainly composed ofyounger Russians, a generation that hopes for a democratic and equal Russia.
The Kremlin is obviously aware that the majority of the protesters are young adults, which is why some preventive measures were put in place to avoid the large gathering of youths in the streets. One of the main strategies was a joint action with some universities, which scheduled mandatory classes on January 23rd for all of their students. Furthermore, some universities have threatened to expel students caught protesting.
Emphasising the threat of the youth to Russian authorities, police went as far as todetain children. Russia’s Commissioner for Children’s Rights,Anna Kuznetsova, confirmed thatat least 300 minors were detained across Russia on Jan. 23.The majority of them had not been directly participating in the protests, yet were still taken and questioned by the police.
OVD-Info, a Russian pro-democracy organisation, reported that3,435 people were detainedat rallies across the country on January 23rd. This is on top of activists who were detained due to their association with Navalny, including his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, as well as his aide Lyubov Sobol and his lawyer Vladlen Los.Amnesty Internationaldubbed these arrests as preventive detention: arresting individuals on bogus charges because they aredeemed a political threat. Daria Kozlova explains that once detained, protesters were held for an excessive amount of time, with lack of food and water, and some were even assaulted and tortured while locked up.
Protesters have also been subjected to aseries of violent police tacticsat demonstrations. Countless amounts of video footage across social media shows protesters being beaten, dragged, and deliberately knocked over by police. Several cases have shown protesters being suddenly abducted by people in police vans and unmarked vehicles. Some people’s injuries required medical attention and a handful ofprotesters had to be hospitalised. Journalists present at the protests also faced violence from the police and were detained, despite being marked as press.
Russian authorities had announced prior to the protests that they would be declared illegal, warning of a tough crackdown. However, organisations and different nations have stated that this hardly justifies the extent of repression faced by peaceful protesters who were not inciting violence. Daria points out that internal state and media channels largely failed to clarify that several protest organisers had attempted to get permits for the rallies in order to legalise them, yet their requests were denied.
Police violence during the protests demonstrates anextensive violation of organisational procedures, summarises Daria. As several human rights organisations have outlined as well, these breaches indicate clear attempts to suppress free speech and the right to peaceful assembly. Hence, they have merely energised the protests which are also demanding stronger democracy. Internally, the government and state media have framed protesters as violent provocateurs.State prosecutorshave already opened criminal cases against protesters for violence toward the police.St. Petersburg prosecutors, however, are investigating the violence used by police against protesters.
Police violence has been a common denominator of most protests that have occurred in Russia, andacross the world, over the past year. While causes and national contexts have differed, the repressive tactics used by Russian police closely resemble the repressive tactics used by police forces in theUS,Belarus, andNigeriain 2020. However, we have seen from Russia’s protests that international cases have failed to deter internal movement. Russian protesters most likely expected violence, yet this did not stop them. Police brutality is, therefore, losing its effectiveness as a mechanism to suppress assembly and free speech.
Over recent days, the international community has beencalling on the Kremlin to release Mr. Navalny, but to no avail. The answer foreign affairs officers who contacted the Kremlin would get was to “mind their own business”. In a Facebook post, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the international community should “respect international law…not encroach on national legislation of sovereign states, and address problems in [their] own country”.
In an official press statement, the US State Department condemned the use of violence by police against journalists and demonstrators, adding that prior to Saturday’s events “the Russian government sought to suppress the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression by harassing protest organisers, threatening social media platforms, and pre-emptively arresting potential participants. This follows years of tightening restrictions on and repressive actions against civil society, independent media, and the political opposition”.
Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs,commented on Twitteron Jan. 23 stating
“I deplore widespread detentions, disproportionate use of force, cutting down internet and phone connections”.
The meeting held on Jan. 25 with EU Foreign Affairs Ministers was inclusive asit did not reach a unanimous decision on the sanctions against Russia.

The Italian House of Cards: Reviewing the Reasons for the Political Crisis in Italy,"“Power is a lot like real estate. It is all about location, location, location. The closer you are to the source, the higher your property value.”
These words, uttered by Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) in theNetflixseries “House of Cards,” express the very cynical and power-oriented nature of politics. The series, a political fiction set in the US Congress’ meanders, portrays the career of an ambitious politician whose cynical strategies and deception will eventually grant him the keys to the White House.
When Senator Matteo Renzi, leader of minority partyItalia Viva, opened up the political crisis inItaly, many political analysts (and Italians) struggled to find logic and a clear explanation for such an expected, perilous decision. Thus, some conspiracy theories inevitably popped out. Although Senator Renzi officially avowed that his choice was triggered byPresident Conte‘s veto on the European Stability Mechanism, the peculiar timing of the crisis, right at the peak of the pandemic, sheds some doubts on its real motives.
Is the controversial adoption of the ESM the real reason behind the crisis? Or is Senator Renzi pursuing a “House of Cards”-style political strategy? If yes, what is his real objective? In order to understand the Italian political crisis, it is worth investigating and singling out the hidden, alleged goals behind Senator Renzi’s decision.
The first theory holds that Mr. Renzi would be using leverage on the government togain more relevant positions within the executive itself. In other words,Italia Vivawould be using its bargaining power (its percentage, albeit little, is imperative to maintain the majority in the Senate) to obtain the leadership of strategic Ministries. Before its withdrawal,Italia Vivaonly controlled the Ministries of Agriculture and the Politics for the Family. Per this theory, anew high-profile Ministrywould be the ultimate objective of Senator Renzi, confident thatthe COVID-19 pandemicwould deter other options like voting.
Nonetheless, Senator Renzi’s words seem to push back against this theory:
“I was the mayor of Florence and the Prime Minister of Italy, I achieved everything I could.”
Also,polls showthathis consensus is unlikely to increase, and the dramatic end of his government in 2016 impliedly stonewall his political aspirations.
However, obtaining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Defense would still be of great value for Senator Renzi. A fascinating, highly-recommendedpieceby the Italian newspaperDomaniportrays Senator Renzi running for the Secretariat of NATO. Senator Renzi would count on theAmerican President Joe Biden‘s andFrench President Emmanuel Macron‘s endorsement,Domaniwriter Daniele Erler reports. Mr. Erler’s analysis also highlights that Mr. Renzi, Prime Minister in 2016, was pivotal to the success of Jens Stoltenberg’s nomination – current NATO Secretary, strongly supported by then-President Obama – by vetoing Franco Frattini, the Italian candidate in 2016. Hence, Renzi would now “redeem his voucher” and pretend an Italian Secretary as the leader of NATO, and his friendship with President Biden would ease his climb. A high-profile position in the Italian government would thus strengthen his ties and power in the international arena. Is Mr. Renzi exploiting the crisis as alaunchpad for an international career?
The second hypothesis offers a moreindividualistic perspective, and a sense of hostility toward Mr. Conte would be the real reason behind Mr. Renzi’s move. Although Senator Renzipublicly denied any form of animosity toward the Prime Minister, an article byIl Fatto Quotidianosheds light on the obscure meanders of their relationship. According to Marco Lillo’s article “Il Primo Pranzo Renzi-Conte con La Regia Della Boschi,” Matteo Renzi, during his mandate as PM, did not appreciate Professor Conte’s increasing entente with Maria Elena Boschi, one of Renzi’s proteges.
Moreover, scholars like Gianfranco Pasquino, professor emeritus of Political Science at the University of Bologna, claim that Prime Minister’s Conte charisma and increasing ties with Bruxelles’ political elite was anathema to Renzi, whose silent envy has been witnessed by many of his colleagues. In other words, Renzi would be orchestrating his vendetta, and his ultimate desire would beConte’s fall. Furthermore, polls show that Conte’s approval rate has increased during his mandate, whereas the public opinion remains skeptical toward Renzi’s party.
However, some could rightfully questionwhy Senator Renzi would initially endorse Prime Minister Conte’s executive from the very outset. As Mr. Lillo points out, Renzi could have voted against Conte’s mandate in the Senate from the beginning, but Renzi’smembership to the Democratic Partyhampered his veto. In 2018, as a member of the pro-Conte Democratic Party, Renzi would not have been reelected if he had voted against the executive and thus be responsible for new elections in 2019. (As of now, the political parties’ leader appoints the candidates to be elected by the people).
As Mr. Renzi seceded and createdItalia Vivaand the pandemic deters new elections, he might now use the crisis’s controversial management as a pretext to implement his plan at last.
What if Renzi is sincere about his intensions? After all, he might have triggered the crisis because he was truly and honestly concerned about the government’s paralysis in such crucial times. As a matter of fact, in the past few months, Renzirepeatedly denouncedin the Parliament his exclusion in the executive’s decisions, despite his role in the majority.
Nonetheless,circumstantial evidence still supports the first hypothesis. Whereas Mr. Conte has increased his consensus over time, the 5 Star-Movement, the most voted party in 2018, has not. The controversial policies during the pandemic, the failed alliance with theLega, and several miscarried promises have hindered the consensus of the 5-star movement. The outcome of the regional elections in 2020 corroborates this point. Thus, as the 5-Star movement would fear new, unforeseen elections, their reluctance to terminate their mandate in advance wouldincrease the bargaining power of Mr. Renzi, with the 5-Star movement compelled to accommodate Italia Viva’s requests.
Nevertheless, polls projecting that Matteo Renzi’s political career is doomed to decline would seem to strengthen the likelihood of the latter hypothesis, with Senator Renzi putting his little consensus and public image at risk for the “public good”. In fact, the Senator argues thatthe ESM implementation would be highly beneficial and convenient for the Italian health systembecause of its low-interest rate and the drastic situation of the Italian health system. The 5-Star movement has hitherto failed to provide a substantial and factual critique of the ESM itself, the veto of which is reportedly more ideological than logical. Perhaps, aware of his little consensus but pivotal role in the majority, Mr. Renzi might have politically sacrificed himself to underline the 5-Star controversial governance. In Senator Renzi’s words:
“We will not partake in the biggest waste of money in the history of the Italian Republic.”
The ultimate evolution of the crisis will debunk or confirm the abovementioned reasons behind Mr. Renzi’s choice, withseveral likely scenarios still possiblefor the Italian executive. If (as of today former) PM Conte will negotiate with Mr. Renzi and grant the Senator prestigious Ministries in return for his trust, hypothesis one will come true. If another Prime Minister takes office with Renzi’s endorsement, hypothesis two will be strengthened. If Prime Minister Conte regains his mandate by subverting his stance on the ESM, hypothesis three holds out.
The next days will prove crucial to shape the future of the executive, and in turn of the country’s leadership.

"The Geopolitical, Economic, and Environmental Impacts of TurkStream","On January 1, 2021, at a televised event held near Novi Sad, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic attendedthe opening ceremonyfor the Serbian section of the Balkan Stream natural-gas pipeline, part of a larger project known as TurkStream which delivers Russian gas to Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary. The progression of these two pipelines comes at a pivotal moment in US politics asJoe Bidenstarts his first term andDonald Trumpcompletes his presidency. Beyond the obvious implications on energy distribution and US-EU-Russia relations, TurkStream will also have impacts on regional power distribution in the Balkans and the natural environment of the Black Sea.
To fully understand the significance of theNord Stream 2 and TurkStream projects, it is important to understand their motives, or at least what each major power involved formally and informally states them to be.
According to the Kremlin and the countries which are importing Russian gas, there isstrong economic reasoningfor Russia to cheaply distribute its natural gas to neighboring markets. This is not an issue that unites EU member states, withGermany outwardly in supportof importing increasing amounts of cheap, Russian gas, whileothers remain in stark opposition. The US and some EU countries argue that the motive of these projects is instead tobypass Ukrainein the distribution of energy to astrategically important region.
Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014,sanctionsled primarily by the US temporarily halted pipeline projects and were followed byadditional sanctionsfrom the West in 2019, which halted Nord Stream 2 construction altogether. There have beenfurther sanctionsagainst Russia by the Trump Administration as of January 18, 2021, following Germany’s approval of continuing Nord Stream 2 construction. Kremlin officials went as far as to deem these sanctions to be a form of ‘hybridwarfare‘.
The Kremlin believes that US opposition to the Nord Stream project which has been opposed to different degrees both by the Trump administration and former VP Biden during his time with the Obama administration is simplyWashington trying to promoteits own liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales in Europe. The symbolic strength of these projects is indeed a significant motivator, which can easily be observed in the Russian television channel Russian Insight outwardly describing TurkStream asproof of Russian strengthin the European energy market. Moreover, despite the economic justifications that could be made for these projects by supporters, both the US and Russia understand these pipeline projects to also bepillars of regional control, specifically in the Former Soviet Union.
When it comes to TurkStream, the Balkan section ofthe project is hardly justifiable. The Balkans are already being supplied by the TransBalkan pipeline and EU member Hungary was previously completely supplied by Ukraine’s pipeline, butwill now switchto be supplied by the Serbian one. With this in mind, one can begin to question the advantages and disadvantages of TurkStream for its main actors.
TurkStream creates direct Russian access to the Turkish market, while also positioning Turkey to directly supply gas to the EU, theoretically granting thempolitical and economic leverageover both Europe and Russia. And while it may seem disadvantageous for Balkan nations, especially Serbia, to be monopolized by Gazprom, there aredistinct benefitsincluding profits from transit fees, job creation, investment (both foreign and domestic), and other economic perks.
Beyond monetary implications, there are also political ones, which include thestrategic positioning of Serbia. Russia’s “special relationship” with Serbia was distinctly projected at a meeting involving Putin and Vucic in Sochi on December 4, wherePutin blamed Bulgariafor deliberately delaying the project, as the legality conflicted with EU antitrust legislation. Moreover, in Serbia, the pipeline is owned bya joint venturewhere Gazprom controls 51% of the shares and the state-owned utility Srbijagas controls 49%. Because Serbia does not comply with EU regulations, this type of deal will ultimately move it further away fromEU ascension, which, at this point in time, seems to only be a symbolic goal of the leading political parties, rather than a legitimate aspiration.
The lack of a coherent Western policy approachis further magnified in the recentWashington Agreement, signed between Kosovo and Serbia, mediated by the US, on September 4, 2020. The glaring omission of EU representation in the agreement, however, begs the question of whether this agreement will continue to be considered under the new Biden administration. The agreement was, at least on paper,economic in nature, invigorating a regional trade zone or “mini-Schengen” as it has been referred to, between Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, and North Macedonia and increasing economic interconnectivity between the two. However, there were also several non-binding agreements around topics likeenergy security, among others. Moreover, Serbia’s decision to move forward with TurkStream goes directly against the US’s wishes expressed and agreed to in the Washington Agreement. Since then,Kosovo has expressed hesitationand desire to renegotiate the deal with the new administration.
Beyond geopolitics,environmental impactis also an important factor to consider when looking at the long-term effects of TurkStream. The Black Sea is already heavily polluted, overfished, and overdeveloped. This is, in part, due to itsgeo-economic significanceas a major transit route which makes it particularly susceptible to oil spills and other accidental pollution. Previous exploitation during the Soviet era, in addition to modern-day unsustainable fishing practices and runoff pollution, means that the Black Sea could become the first major waterway in the worldcompletely devoid of life. The construction and operation of TurkStream have the potential to push this environment to the brink.
The EU has beendirectly involvedin the environmental integrity of the Black Sea since the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Looking at Nord Stream 2, one can observe that the way Europeans approach pipeline construction on their own territory iscompletely differentfrom how the Russians approach theirs.
In Germany, micro tunneling, a process that is considered “clean” due to the fact fewer materials enter and exit the construction site, is used for pipeline placement. In the highly valuable Kurgalsky reserve in Russia, however, normal construction involving an 85-meter open trench has already hadmajor negative implications on wildlife. Further, because the majority of Russian gas is exported, the amount of gas available to the Russian people has become insufficient. As a result, 30 percent of Russians live in non-gasified homes and instead are fueled by coal, which, in turn, can have a “black sky effect” on local communities due to the “dirty” nature of coal emissions.
Therefore, theEU Third Energy Packagewhich governs natural gas pipeline construction from Russia to the EU can arguably be understood as agreen-washing mechanism. Upon further study, it becomes increasingly difficult to observe this legislation as part of a transition to a green energy future when it relies on gas from a production process thatdestroys natural habitats.
Namely, there remains an issue with justifying LNG as a feasibly sustainable energy source when the market monopoly belongs to Russia. Beyond the reasons previously listed, one can consider the extremely detrimental practice ofgas-flaring,a type of gas combustion used to dispose of waste or unusable gas. This practice emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, particularly methane and sulfur dioxide which are known carcinogens. Russia leads in world statistics of gas flaring.
Environmental hazards can also pose a significantthreat to vulnerable communities. The source of gas for Nord Stream 2 is primarilythe Yamal Peninsula, home to various tribal nations whose rights are being violated in order to produce cheap gas. The impacts on these communities and the endangered species they coexist with are not covered in any way, shape, or form in theenvironmental impact assessmentthat Gazprom released meaning that they are not taken into account when being considered for EU consumption.
The long-term political and environmental implications of TurkStream are still unknown. However, Nord Stream 2 provides a case study that can allow for reasonable predictions. With all of this information in mind one may ask the following questions:

The Forgotten Land: A Look at Northern England,"The debate between the North and South has long been a contentious topic in England, much like it has in countries across the globe. Thedivide across the countryis one that permeates through England’s history, and as much as this divide carries salient social considerations, it also offers economic, health, transport, and educational discrepancies, which have led to theUK Office for National Statisticsreporting an18.6-year difference in life expectancybetween the two regions (71.9 years in Richmond-Upon-Thames compared to 53.3 years in Blackpool, 2016-18).
The predominant reason for the North’s current depreciation is itsindustrial roots, which, during the Industrial Revolution, made it the primary powerhouse of the UK, with factories and smog lining its cities and countryside. A return to these more prosperous days has been used as political fodder by many including Former UK Chancellor and Conservative MPGeorge Osborne, whose constituency Tatton is in North-West England, promising of northern powerhouse under the coalition government.
These plans, however, seem to have stagnated, andthe North has remained mostly unchanged. There are also areas within the South that have seen the same decline since their industrial days, especially in mining and industrial centres in the South-West. All of these areas, however, remain a world away from the glitz and glamour of the South-East, which is home to London and its luxuries.
Whilst the stereotype of smog juxtaposed against the glitz of the Ritz seems centuries old, it is, in fact, only relevantsince the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Pre-1760, the common people of the North functioned much like their counterparts across the rest of the country, primarily garnering a living fromagriculturein the countryside, with towns being focal points for artisan crafts. Living conditions were far lower, and life was not stable; income from pre-industrialised agriculture was at the whim of good weather, and annual plagues and illnesses stagnated population growth.
However, the economic layout of the country was very different from today’s layout. Towns such as Nottingham, Norwich, and many others were important landmarks, colonised by the Anglo Saxons, then occupied by Norman Kings. Cloth and textile production (possible because of England’s abundance of sheep) allowed Tudor monarchs to secure trade deals with far wealthier European nations such as the Netherlands. While London has always been more populous than other towns in England and served as a centre for mercantile and commercial operations due to the fact that it houses the Crown,the inequality we see today between the capital and the North is far more recent.
Due to the explosion of wealth in England during the days of the British Empire, the UK is now a prominent player on the international stage.Industrialisationandcolonialism, whilst leading the UK to this position, also led to the UK’sincreasing centralisation, which worsened the economic fallout from the decline of post-revolution industrial work.
Industrialisation revolutionised the world, starting with the UK, and the transition to mechanised production across industries and manufacturing led to a period of unprecedented sustained growth in average income and population. This unparalleled growth lasted an entire century, and the industrial landscape transformed from agricultural to factories, assembly lines, dedicated to primary, e.g. mining, and manufacturing, e.g. textile, industries.The North was home to a great number of these industrieswith regional economies and job markets becoming dependent on one factory, mine, or other public service.
However, beginning in the 1980s, the UK entered a period ofdeindustrialisationwith severe declines in its primary and manufacturing industries due to the abundance of affordable alternatives overseas, combined with cheaper transportation costs leading to mass outsourcing.Jobs in these industries disappeared overnight as demand fell, whilst demand for services grew, a sector mainly based in the South and in particular in London.
It was cheaper to outsource primary and manufacturing industries, however the loss of these industries was not replaced by new jobs for the hundreds of thousands they had previously supported, and this was most hard hit in the North.Manufacturingandmining industries, as well as the UK economy, underwent another revolution: where they had previously contributed 40% of the UK’s GDP in 1979, this fell to just 34% in 1990 – and has since fallen more dramatically still to just under 22%. This was coupled with an unemployment rate of 11.9% in 1984, and as suchincome inequality increased: where the poorest 10% had a weekly income of £151 in 1979, this increased by only 4.6% to £158 in 1990.
For the top 10%,a weekly income was £472.98 in 1979 and £694.83 in 1990. In 2019,the average high-wage earners earned £1448 a week, whilst the lowest-paid earn £306.
With the industrial, public-service focused nature of its past, the North has long been abeacon of left-wing politics,socialism, andunionism, proving to be fertile ground for the Labour party garnering a reputation of being ‘the red wall’. In recent years, however, this red wall has started to crumble, and in 2019, it turned blue when, across Northern England, there was an overwhelming amount of votes for Conservatives for the first time in over 100 years.
Many believed that after years of neglect, this event would finallyprompt the North to be properly recognised by the government in Westminster, especially with the Conservative MPs loyal to the government. However, the North was once again the victim of neglect and ignorance.
This division is clearer than ever when exploring the government’s response to theCOVID-19 outbreak. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK undertook a national approach in which the whole of England went into lockdown. As the virus numbers decreased,Prime Minister Johnsonstarted to ease measures in certain areas where the numbers were reducing. This tier system offered a chance for well-performing areas to reap the benefits of a relative return to normality however, this return, according to some, was skewed.
As numbers decreased in London and the hospitality industry reopened,in Manchester (and across much of the North), lockdown measures continued and workers were left out of jobs and out of pocket. This was despite the fact that the R rate across Manchesterwas 0.8-1 and cases were falling at 3% a daycompared to 1-1.2% and cases increasing by 3.3% per day in the South.
When decision-makers in Westminster decided to impose restrictions on much of the North, Northern leaders decided that it was time to act. Following the announcement of these strict measures,the Labour party elected-mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham, who retaliated against the government and their decision to pressure the North into providing support for workers. Mayor Andy Burnham tweeted a story from the Daily Mail in which cabinet member Michael Gove requested that London remained in lockdown, saying:
“So it would seem the Government added an extra point to their five criteria – just for London. Obviously,jobs everywhere else don’t matter as much.”
The elite in Westminster were less than impressed with Burnham’s newfound status as “King of the North” and embarked upon days of talks with leaders across the region. Requestinga £90m relief package to support workersand businessesthat had been shut up due to the new restrictions, Mr. Burnham settled on £65m as the very minimum he could accept.Prime Minister Johnsonrefused to go above £60m because he did not want to be seen giving Greater Manchester a better settlement than others he had handed out across the nation. Subsequently, Johnson refused to verbally honour his commitment to give £60m to workers and business five times, saying instead that it was a matter of negotiation, and instead, invited Mr Burnham back for further discussion.
Grouping the country into tiers was widely interpreted as away of dividing the country, and the long-term effects of this debate are yet to be seen with the country now back in full lockdown. Upcoming local elections in May will likely serve as areferendumon thesuccess of the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, and it will be interesting to see how councils across the North react.

Myanmar Military Coup: An Ensuing Crisis of Democracy,"On February 1, the Myanmar military enacted a coup d’état against the governing National League for Democracy (NLD). The party’s leadership, including former State Counsellor of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, and former President, Win Myint, are still in detainment. The military, led by General Min Aung Hlaing, currently controls the government, having declared a year-long state of emergency. The country is now in a democratic crisis; each side alleges violations of a relatively recent, fragile democracy. Added to this is intensified civil unrest, as protests against the military have persisted across the country and Min Aung Hlaing’s government has continued to crack down on the civilians calling for the NLD to be reinstated.
Myanmar military’s coup was a demonstration against the country’s November 2020 general election. In the election, theNLD won a majority of seatsin both houses of parliament and hence, the mandate to form government. Themilitary immediately contested the result, claiming that the opposition, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), was the rightful winner. The claims were based on allegations of ‘irregularities’ in the voting process, amounting to an undemocratic election.
Myanmar’s former President, and former general of the military, Thein Sein, currently leads the military’s favored party: the USDP. The Party became regarded as an avenue for members of Myanmar’s military to enter government. On the other hand, the NLD also posed a rising threat to the military, with Aung San Suu Kyi, a prominent anti-military rule activist and pioneer of democracy, at the forefront. Election results confirmed that the NLD remained popular among Myanmar’s people, maintaining Suu Kyi’s continued status as a favorable leader for a country recovering from military dictatorship.
After failing to contest the results with the Union Election Commission (UEC), however, Myanmar’s military imposed a state coup. Fears of a state coup were already prevalent in January, especially afterGeneral Aung Hlaing suggested revoking the country’s constitutionunder certain circumstances. Military chiefs attempted to alleviate these fears, however, assuring they will abide by the constitution. Nevertheless, a state coup was enforced shortly after, with the military claiming it to be constitutional. This stand against NLD rule also symbolized a refusal to accept further decline to the military’s power in the country. Now at the helm of government again, the military has suppressed the democratic movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi, while claiming to be acting democratically.
At the core of the military coup and the clash between Myanmar’s competing regimes is a crisis of democracy. The military move to overhaul the NLD was rooted in allegations of election fraud. The new junta government maintains that the election process and its results were undemocratic, stemming from a culmination of factors such as poor-quality ballot boxes. Hence, the election was declared fraudulent.
However, the military’s motive extends farther than the 2020 election. The NLD’s rule posed a conflict of interest with the increasingly side-lined military. The coup is largely seen as an undemocratic response to Aung Sang Suu Kyi’s undemocratic arrival to power in the first place. Her position as State Counsellor, essentially the leader of Myanmar, was regarded as a sidestep around the military-drafted constitution, which specifically highlighted that those with foreign family members (Suu Kyi was widowed by a British husband) were not allowed to be President. Furthermore, the coup re-instated military dominance following several NLD proposals to reduce military power in the country. Such proposals included the revision of the military’s hold of a quarter of seats in parliament. The coup, therefore, answered to perceived violations of the military’s own democratic instruments by the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi.
In spite of this, the majority of Myanmar’s population continues to vocalize its support for the NLD, and especially Aung San Suu Kyi. Following encouragement from the party itself, protests across the country have been demanding that the NLD be reinstated into government. Considering the role she played in scaling down the military’s power in Myanmar, and consequently instilling civic rule through the NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi is widely regarded as seen as spearheading Myanmar’s democratic milestones, and hence a favorable leader for the country. In contrast, Min Aung Hlaing, as a military general, represents the oppressive instruments of authoritarian military rule that have kept Myanmar from democratizing for decades.
Although refusing to respond to civilian demands, the military asserts that its priorities during the state of emergency will be to unearth the alleged election fraud and manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite overhauling an elected government, the military’s approach is that of a perceived commitment to respecting democracy. This is not the first military coup to have taken place in Myanmar, yet it is more pacified. This complements the notion that repeating history is no longer an option in Myanmar, which has seen exceptional democratic milestones in recent years, regardless of recent events. By asserting that there is a commitment to investigate election fraud and deliver a new general election in a year’s time, the military is more or less demonstrating some respect for the country’s relatively new democratic boundaries.
While this would leave some possibility for Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD to eventually regain leadership of the country, the dialogue surrounding the military’s planned future election largely avoids the prospect of NLD rule.Min Aung Hlaing’sassertion that the coup was inevitable and necessary for the military to “steer the country” suggests he no longer sees a pathway for Myanmar to include the leadership of the NLD and Suu Kyi. This would therefore amount to extensive democratic violations, as any positioning of the NLD in future government would be entirely discarded, despite the popular support of the party.
What further diminishes the prospect of a future democratic government in Myanmar is the new regime’s crackdown on thecivil unrestthat has ensued following the coup. Attesting to the majority vote for the NLD party, vast numbers of Myanmar’s civilians took to the streets to protest the military’s actions and demand the re-installment of the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi into government. In response, the new regime imposed numerous repressive tactics against protests, which have grown bloodier by the day.
Initial steps taken by the military to suppress protests includeddisruptions to communication across the country; local media channels and internet services, including access to social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp, have been cut. Furthermore, police forces turned out in large numbers to dissuade protest groups from growing. During the first weeks of protests, some police forces were present in riot gear, injuring protestors with rubber bullets and water cannons. Theresponse to the protest movement has since escalated, as over 100 killings of protestors have now been reported across Myanmar, and more protestors have also disappeared. Activists and journalists continue to be arrested; over 2,000 people have now been detained following the military coup. Myanmar’s ruling military has threatened lengthyprison sentencesfor protestors partaking in the anti-coup and anti-military demonstrations.
The ensuing civil unrest signifies widespread dissatisfaction with the military’s decision to overhaul an elected civilian government. Chanting phrases, such as“We demand democracy!”, thousands of protestors have called out the military coup as undemocratic and illegitimate. Military actions to suppress these protests have contributed to the popular anger, as they demonstrated further restrictions to civic freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and in some cases, violations of their very basic human rights such as the right to life. These repressive actions have therefore also contributed to the country’s current democracy crisis, as the military continues to crack down on civilians who maintain they have elected the NLD as their government. Furthermore, by legally accusing protestors of inciting hatred toward the military, the current government has extended its capacity to suppress the electoral decision.
The international sphere has demanded that Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, and other ministers and party officials, be released from detainment.International leadershave threatened action against Myanmar’s military for the take-over of the state, and for the crackdown on pro-democracy protestors. TheUShas announced sanctions against ten military officials and companies they are linked to. TheUKhas also voiced its reproach towards Myanmar’s military, calling for the vote of the people to be respected.Although international support for Aung San Suu Kyi has declined following Myanmar’s 2017 Rohingya crisis, she is still highly revered in the international arena for her role in freeing Myanmar from military rule. On the contrary, Min Aung Hlaing has less international respect as the primary perpetrator of the persecution of Myanmar’s Rohingya minority, during which 700,000 thousand Rohingya fled to Bangladesh following a brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s military, which was internationally branded as ethnic cleansing. TheInternational Criminal Court’scase investigating Aung Hlaing’s crimes against humanity is ongoing.
In condemning the coup, international governments and institutions have affirmed the importance of democratic principles. Responding to the situation, theUnited Nations Security Councilhas stressed “the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes”. The UNSC has also called for “dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar”. International attention has therefore not been focused on the practices of the coup alone, but also on the repression of Myanmar’s citizens who have been protesting the coup as a result. TheUN High Commissioner for Human Rightshas highlighted the crackdown Myanmar’s civilians have faced, as well as the shutdown in communication services, restricting their ability to access and transmit information. International statements are therefore outlined by democratic values, and rooted in support for Myanmar’s electorate and their right to choose a government.

Reddit vs. Wall Street: Regulating is the Best Way Forward,"In January 2021, bound-to-fail company GameStop saw the value of its shares soar 1,700%, marking the beginning of the Reddit vs. Wall Street confrontation. Behind the unexpected rise in share value were Reddit users from the subredditr/wallstreetbets. The purpose of their “spontaneous movement” was to show discontent with the perceived unfairness of the financial market.
Despite popular support for the initiative, small investors encountered heavy financial constraints including the decision of online trading platform Robinhood to halt the purchase of GameStop shares.  Overall, the impression was that “all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others“, meaning that amateur investors could not benefit from the loose regulations that apply to institutional investors.
The financial market, though, is a human creation and none of its features are “natural” or necessary. The systemcanbe corrected and improved and this “David vs. Goliath”-like clash helped point out elements that need to be reformed or regulated. The first part of this article will sum up the events while the second part will point out the most problematic issues that have arisen. The third part will suggest some corrections that could improve the health of the financial market.
GameStop, the world’s largest videogame retailer, has been in deep water for quite some time. Especially during the pandemic as digital marketplaces got a foothold,the company liquidated 27.3% of its stores. By January 2021, GameStop shares were only worth four dollars each, and management predicted having toclose 1,000 stores by April 2021. The backlash of GameStop workers to this news would have been devastating.
Things changed the moment some amateur investors from the subredditr/wallstreetbetsrealized that GameStop was being “shorted”. Shorting a stock, essentially, entails bettingagainstthe rise (or the reprise) of a company. The proceeding is quite intuitive, albeit risky. In extreme synthesis, investors (usually hedge funds) borrow shares from a broker and sell them to a third party. The underlying condition is that the shares will be returned at a later time.
When, as expected, the company shares lose value, the investor buys them back at a lower price. This process allows professional investors to pocket billions, to the detriment of struggling or failing companies. This time, though,Redditors decided that they had had enough with this exploitative practiceand took action to defy the financial system with a counter-campaign. Despite the lack of any centralized organization, they spontaneously started buying GameStop stocks by the thousands.
What started as a sporadic event quickly became a tidal wave. In the span of a few weeks, r/wallstreetbets grew from one to nine million subscribers. Contextually, the value of a single GameStop share rose from four to 150 dollars in late January.
This improvised “movement” gained the sympathy of Elon Musk. On January 26, 2021, Tesla foundertweeteda cryptic “gamestonk!” to show his support. Interestingly, US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also got on board with the sympathizers. Thisunlikely allianceproved that the Reddit “DIY uprise” was capable of gathering a broad and eminent fanbase.
What was the purpose of this coordinated action? The main idea behind the mass purchase of GameStop stock was to trigger a “short squeeze” to artificially increase the demand for a specific stock so that its price skyrockets. This, of course, upsets short sellers’ apple carts because these sellers had hoped that GameStop’s share value would drop.
Consequently,short-sellers had to buy back the shares they had previously sold, which is the only way to minimize losses during a short squeeze. By that point, however, the shares’ value was so high that losing billions of dollars was inevitable. From this perspective, the short squeeze was a way to “punish” Wall Street investors and their greed and “holding” the shares was the small investors’ way to make the process as long-lasting and hurtful as possible.
Given that some investors are particularly combative, arm wrestling between them may go on for quite some time. Some of the effects are already apparent. The biggest short-seller involved,Melvin Capital hedge fund, lost 53% of its value. In absolute terms, that’s about6.6 billion dollars.Not even a 2.75 billion dollar capital injection by Point72 Asset Administration and Citadel could contain the loss. In the end, Melvin Capital had toclose its short position.
The main fear on Wall Street is thatthe hemorrhage could spill over to other hedge fundsthat also have short positions. For now, Citron Capital – another short-seller – has had to close its short position. According to its owner Andrew Left, it did so “at a loss, 100 percent” while at the same time, this momentary loss will likely not bring hedge funds to their knees, even if it does hurt them. However, a few billion dollars in losses are nothing unprecedented.
On the other hand,small investors are not winning, either. In fact, the value of GME has sharply decreased from its all-time-high in late January. As of mid-February, the value per share is $52.40. Why were Redditors unable to fully succeed in their endeavor? To answer this question, it is necessary to take a look at the problems that emerged as the events unfolded.
The first problematic event occurred on January 28, 2021, when Robinhood – an online trading platform –prevented stakeholders from buying GameStop Stocksarguing that it was protecting customers against “market volatility”. This didn’t exempt the company from harsh accusations and users lamented that Robinhood was “doing the bidding of Wall Street and rigging the market against its own customers“.
The most obvious explanation is that “all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others”. In other words, professional investors can do almost anything they want and laws and regulations bend at their will. On the other hand, small investors can be prevented from exercising their right to profit from the stock market.
A more rational explanation is thatRobinhood was simply serving its own interest. Most of its users are amateur investors, but they – unlike institutional investors –do not pay transaction fees. As a result, they have less bargaining power and their preferences can be put aside. In the end, Robinhood may have damaged its image beyond repair. Redditors are not forgiving and have alreadysued Robinhood for market manipulation.
On Wall Street, the stunt pulled by Redditors triggered unprecedented disarray. Traditionally, professional investors are the self-styled champions of neoliberalism who claim that the State’s role in the economy should be minimal in the name of “freedom”. As it became increasingly undeniable that hedge funds were losing billions, the narrative began to change.
That’s when Wall Street investors started asking forheavy-handed State regulations. In short, not only did hedge funds indulged in years of predatory behavior, “hammering fragile companies into extinction“, now, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) also needed to withstand their outcry.
Interestingly, Wall Street investors began criticizing, the flaws of Redditors that are usually attributed to them to the point of calling those involved “the financial equivalent of the White House insurrectionists“. While their behavior was destabilizing, isn’t that the objective of every protest? At the very least, this event clarified thatWall Street investors do not want the loose regulations that apply to them to be extended to everyone in the stock market.
Garth Theunissen of the Financial Mail offered a more interesting read of Redditors’ actions. He wrote that “the GameStop phenomenon isn’t just speculation. It’s anger.” But where did this acrimony come from? The motivations of small investors are varied and personal, but it appears thatthis anger dates back to the financial crisis.
Many Redditors shared their stories, entailing job losses, debts, and shattered families. One user even posted anopen letter to Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that bet against GameStop. Among the accusations are exploiting struggling companies and manipulating the market, making it hard to deny that social injustice is at the core of what happened.The widespread perception is that, back in 2008, banks and hedge funds were unfairly bailed outwhile average citizens, on the other hand, were left to struggle.
While the grudges against Wall Street areancient, the pandemic may have played a role in triggering the r/wallstreetbets movement. In fact, aftera momentary shock at the dawn of the pandemic, thestock market has thrived during the crisis. Billionaires made huge returns, while everyday people were losing jobs and getting sick which, in turn, unleashed the social discontent buried after “Occupy Wall Street” once again.
While Redditors failed to topple Wall Street’s regime, it is likely that this was through no fault of their own. On the contrary, there are elements suggesting that the financial game is “rigged” by allowing the rich to get richer, and cutting everyone else out. So, isn’t there merit in having taken on the challenge?
With this perspective, r/wallstreetbets won a moral victory after whihc at least some of its members could have earned a life-changing sum. Instead, they decided to “hold” their shares, apparently with the sole purpose of proving a point thatthe financial system is broken and unjust, as well asintrinsically absurd, but not immune from challenges.
What is the “lesson learned” from the Reddit vs Wall Street quarrel? It is clear thatthe financial world will not reform itselfwhich, from a cynical viewpoint, is perfectly understandable. If given the chance to make virtually endless money, who would worry about the “moral grey area”? This is all the more true as money does not buy only goods and services anymore, it can buy political power and strategic influence, too.
So, what are some useful measures that can make the stock market “less of a casino“? How can it become more of a place where people invest in companies they actually believe in?
Apart from moral considerations on profiting from someone else’s demise, “short selling” can also stunt innovation.Recent researchtries to prove that short selling can actually boost competitiveness because it would have the merit of ousting out of the market companies that are not performing particularly well.
What it does not take into account is that,when a large company (like GameStop) goes out of business, thousands of jobs are lost. This kind of research also fails to consider thatmany of these companies could actually be savedby investinginthem the same money that is investedagainstthem.
But is a full ban on short-selling necessary? Duncan Lamont, from Schroders, makes a convincing case against that by claiming that “short selling does not directly undermine the health of a company any more than buying its shares improves its fundamentals“. In other words:a heavily regulated, ethical short-sell is possiblebut it requires banning some problematic related practices. For example, generating negative publicity for a company whose shares the investor wants to short-sell.
Alessandro Graziani from “Il Sole 24 ore” suggesteda new legislative framework for the “new forms of solicitation to saving”. Nowadays, influencers can point small investors towards buying certain specific stocks, meaning that one Elon Musks tweet is all it took to make Dogecoin’s value raise by 800%.
As a result, it is possible that a huge mass of money may be directed towards only a few stocks or that certain shares may rapidly gain value to the detriment of others. In both cases, the main consequence would be that the value of said stocks, artificially inflated, may raise far beyond their “real” value. Such spikes in value are unsustainable inthe long-term.
At first glance, this measure would seem to favor big investors and remove the threat of “influencer-led” investments, which increase volatility. Upon closer examination, however, it seems thatsuch a measure could protect small investors, too. When the goal is to save money, financial stability is a fundamental facilitating factor. Market volatility gives Redditors as well as institutional investors the thrill of using the stock market as a casino, but more careful,long-term investors cannot afford to lose their money on a bet.
In the end, beyond considerations on the ethics of speculative investment, it must be noted that it is ever more widespread. Opening the financial market to a broader number of people means, among other things, that elements other than sheer financial gain enter the decision-making game.
This case demonstrated that, notwithstanding the potential backlash on their finances, ‘small investors’ are willing to manifest their grievances by manipulating (in an ostensibly spontaneous manner) the stock market. The reason for their perceived unity is quite clear: to different extents, it appears that, in general, Redditors (and many of their sympathizers) feel like they have been let down, or even betrayed, at some point in their lives.
Many lost jobs or houses during the 2007 financial crisis, and resent banks and financial markets. Some have found it hard to get back on their feet, while others haven’t. In any case, there is arguably a socio-economic grievance behind the Reddit vs. Wall Street confrontation. Thus, when all of a sudden common people were able to figure how to “beat the house”, they did not hesitate.
It is still unclear whether, when, or with what consequences this bubble will burst, but this incident suggests that there may be others in the future if the behavior ofallinvestors is not regulated. After all, not everyone has a specific grievance. Some amateur investors are just in it for the thrill of a bet and may behave recklessly while some institutions may simply try to earn extra returns, which ultimately has the same consequences.
Instability benefits neither group and is detrimental to more conservative, small investors. For this reason, addressing this new, ‘enlarged’ financial market should be a priority going forward. For now, the “short squeeze” has only concerned private companies that had “short” positions but there have already been situations where that the object of short selling was anevent, for example, thereferendum over Brexit.
Political events are, therefore, not immune to speculation, but they are very vulnerable to instability. As a consequence, it is clear that in the near future the shortcomings of the financial market need to be addressed policy-wise. While the financial market will likely continue to exist for some time, it does not need to be unbalanced, unjust, or irrational.","March 04, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/reddit-vs-wall-street-a-clash-with-no-victory/,Shary Mitidieri,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Lights on Shame: A Commission in Ireland Reveals the Weight of Stigma,"On January 12th, an appalling report was released in Ireland concerning a dreadful situation of unwed women and their children in Mother and Babies Homes between 1922-1998 when the Commission of Investigation revealed the abuses the residents suffered.
As the report mentions these homes, which were previously workhouses established under the Poor Relief Act of 1838, can be found in almost every county. In the past, the workhouses aimed to offer support to poor, disadvantaged people, hosting the elderly, homeless, and single mothers and their babies.
Furthermore, these workhouses became hosting institutions for women with children born outside of marriage. Some pregnancies were the result of rape, some had mental health issues, and others ended up there in order to avoid judgment from their community and the family. The women admitted to the workhouses were between 18 and 40 years old, with younger women between the ages of 18 and 29 constituting 80% of the makeup.
In the period examined by the Commission, about 56,000 unmarried mothers and 57,000 children were counted, but the number is believed to be higher by approximately 25,000 more women and children.
According to the report, there were two types of institutions, governmental and religious. In the case of governmental institutions, local authorities were responsible for running costs, maintenance, and major improvements. Staff was employed by the local authority, which financed the institutions through local rates via a property tax. In the case of religious institutions, mother and baby homes were private institutions run by religious congregations or charities.
“Most mother and baby homes in other countries were run by religious organizations and the religious salvation of mothers and children was central to their mission.”
Ultimately, local and regional governments played a role in the tacit acceptance of these organizations. The First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster recognized the silence the victims were forced into and welcomed the report as the first step “to bring the truth into the open”.
“We made them feel guilty and ashamed.
Archbishop Eamon Martin, leader of the Irish Catholic Church, condemned the treatment of vulnerable pregnant women. He expressed a feeling of embarrassment for what “we in the Church contributed to, and bolstered, that culture of concealment, condemnation, and self-righteousness. For that I am truly sorry and ask the forgiveness of survivors“.
Even if the report claims that “there is a small number of complaints of physical abuse” (Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, para. 15), it also recognizes that women underwent arduous work for which they should have been paid.
“Many of the women did suffer emotional abuse and were often subject to denigration and derogatory remarks. It appears that there was little kindness shown to them and this was particularly the case when they were giving birth.”
The trauma was worse for “women whose pregnancy had devastated their normal life and resulted in their removal from home, family, and friends” (Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, para. 17). Children also suffered discrimination since they were seen as “illegitimate”. After 1953, when adoption was legalized, a new opportunity instead of entering the vicious, dead-end circle of other institutions became possible for them. Furthermore, “the high rate of infant mortality (first year of life) in Irish mother and baby homes is probably the most disquieting feature of these institutions” (Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, para. 229).Alarmingly, authorities were aware of this data, but because the concept of “illegitimacy” was highly stigmatized because it signified a breach of honor for the family and the woman involved. This destroyed the perspectives of marriage for the woman directly involved, and for her siblings as well.
Last but not least, among the findings, the Commission reported:1) The death of almost 9,000 children, approximately 15% of all the children who were in the institutions;2) The death of 200 mothers;3) A total of seven vaccine trials inside the institutions under investigation in the period 1934-1973; the Commission has identified a significant number of the children involved (Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes,  respectively, para. 12, 243, 248).
The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes was dissolved on February 28th, but not without criticism. One of the critiques made was that its dissolution might create an obstacle for the survivors in seeking justice and opposing the report’s outcome. Last but not least, audio recordings of witnesses who had knowledge of the mother and baby homes were deleted. Of the children who died between 1922-1998 (76 years), the Commission could not find burial records or graves of everyone.
• How can we bring about justice for the crimes committed almost one century ago that lasted for so long?• What is the role of “stigma” in initiating discriminatory processes?• How can the government make amends for the tacit discriminatory system that lasted almost 80 years?

Death and Detention: The Price that Journalists Pay in Democracies,"Since 1993, 1,439 journalists have been killedacross the world over their work. One hundred fifty-six of these deaths occurred between 2018 and 2019, with an additional 42 deaths in 2020. In the region of West Asia and North Africa, with numbers peaking inIraq, Syria, Algeria, and Afghanistanare countries with the highest number of journalists killed. Although, countries such asMexico, Honduras, Colombia, and Brazil, in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as thePhilippines and India, have had increased journalist deaths in recent years. Latin America and the Caribbean region represented 40% of killings in 2019; Asia and the Pacific region represented 26%; West Asia and North Africa represented 18%.
Despite being democracies, Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines are among the countries with the highest number of journalist deaths. If not killed, many journalists are subject to varying threats and punishments, such as detainment or public defamation.
The majority of journalists’ deaths occur outside of armed conflict and terror attacks. Many journalists are killed at their offices, while working on specific assignments, such as investigative reports, and while covering domestic protests. Some are also killed outside of their specific work context, such as at their home. The victims tend to be local to the area where they are killed. Many are political journalists. Hence, these deaths contribute to the alarming trend of journalist killings by central governments, or government-linked groups, as a result of reporting on internal political crises, such as corruption and human rights abuses.
Linked to this is also the issue of impunity. Rarely do cases of journalist deaths achieve justice for the victims. However, there has been aslight increase in cases being resolvedin recent years. In 2018, 11% of journalist deaths were resolved; this rose to 12% in 2019, and 13% in 2020. Initiatives by international organizations, like the UN, have worked to curtail impunity in cases of journalist deaths.
Journalist killings in democracies are violations of those very democracies. The role that journalists perform in democratic societies, including the sharing of political information and scrutiny of public offices, is viewed as crucial to upholding the democratic elements of such societies. Where journalist deaths do occur in such democracies, governments are expected to implement protective instruments that safeguard journalists, allowing them to continue performing their role, and in turn, safeguarding democracy.
Scholarship outlines that countries’ protective mechanisms for journalists, their citizens’ demand for information, and the perception that journalists safeguard democracy, should lead to fewer journalists being killed for their work. However, does this concern the same democracies whose leaders are the ones killing journalists?Jonathan A. Solispoints to the press safety paradox. A democracy’s openness and enablement of journalists to speak and disperse information freely heighten the risk of them being harmed/killed for their work. This is because this freedom empowers journalists to investigate sensitive topics, which begin to pertain to issues like government corruption. As a result, journalists are killed for unearthing such issues.
Mexico is one example of a democracy demonstrating the press-safety paradox. The country has become notorious for its journalist deaths. In 2020, Mexico had the highest death toll in the world, with14 journalists killed. Its democratic image has become tarnished by cases of native journalists being either attacked or killed for their reporting. This work usually involves revealing the practices of organized crime groups however, many have also been found to have been reporting on crime and corruption by the government.
Mexico also has one of the highest rates of impunity over journalists’ deaths in the world. Over 90% of cases are unresolved. This is contributed to by frequently negative sentiment by the government, namelyPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Obrador’s administration has attacked the country’s media workers in the past for supposed false reporting. Yet, it has simultaneously recognized violence against journalists in the country, pledging to put an end to it. This has done little to end such violence, however, as cases continue to rise. Moreover, several of these cases still reveal connections between journalist deaths and public officials.
One of the most recent cases occurred in March 2021, when co-founder and editor of La Prensa de Tlaxcala,Alberto Amaro Jordán, was almost driven off a road in Tetla de la Solidaridad. Although not a death, this case reveals the high level of threat Amaro, a journalist, faced at the hands of a public official. The driver of the attacking vehicle was identified as the mayor of Tetla de la Solidaridad: Eleazar Molina Pérez. The incident followed Amaro’s reporting on the mayor in the run-up to elections for federal congress, and his alleged links to corruption in property investment. Once identified, Molina was taken to a local state prosecutor. However, he was released without being charged. Not only does this case depict the danger journalists face for reporting on corruption by elected officials, but it also contributes to the country’s high level of impunity. Although, the attack is relatively recent; organizational pressure may promise accountability.
A prominent case resurfaced in late 2020. A reporter for the newspaper La Jornada,Miroslava Breach Velducea, was killed by an unknown shooter near her home in Chihuahua, in March 2017. This followed a series of anonymous threats, which Breach received as a result of her reporting work. Authorities linked the attack to a local criminal group, Los Salazar, which Breach was reporting on for trying to get its members elected as mayors around the state. Adevelopment in December 2020revealed that one of the suspects in the murder, Hugo Amed S., former mayor of Chínipas, was arrested. Amed was suspected to have been passing on information about the Breach to the gang, yet again proving the corrupt connections that continue to exist between officials and criminals in the country.
Lydia Cachounderwent severe abuse for her work. In 2005, she published a book revealing a child pornography ring in Mexico, to which she connected several politicians. Cacho was detained in the state of Puebla for alleged defamation. She was tortured while in police custody. In February 2020, Mexican authorities arrested Mario Marín, the governor of Puebla at the time of Cacho’s arrest and a culprit in her treatment. Former Puebla public security secretary Adolfo Karam is also believed to be responsible but has not been arrested yet.
Most journalist deaths in Mexico have, however, been exclusively linked to criminal gangs. One example is the death ofJorge Miguel Armenta Ávalos, who was shot by a group of men in Cajeme. Armenta and his staff had been reporting on violence and murders by criminal gangs in the local area. TheMexican Government, through its Federal Mechanism for the Protection of Journalists, publicly condemned the killing, calling for clarification on the case.
Although not all journalists targeted by governments are killed, many are still prosecuted. The ‘hot spots’ for these arrests in democracies tend to be large-scale protest movements. Recent protests occurring in Myanmar, against the February military coup, have contributed to a worldwide pattern of journalists being arrested for reporting on such events.Myanmar’s military leadershave ordered several journalists to be detained for being present at protests and reporting on them. These detainments have been enacted under laws banning the spreading of ‘false’ information. Such prosecutions have therefore countered the progress that Myanmar has made in parting with its media repression – progress landmarked by initiatives like the2014 News Media Law, which strengthened rights for media workers and created space for free speech.
Myanmar has a relatively fresh relationship with democracy, one which became recently destabilized. Nevertheless, the influence of figures like Aung San Suu Kyi has empowered Myanmar’s civilians to enact their democratic rights. With this, a transition into a democratically elected government has also empowered democratic institutions in the country, one of which is journalism.
This empowerment was exemplified at protests across the country, as civilians remained vocal in demanding that the military Government reinstate Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy. Journalists played a crucial role in not only transmitting information about the military coup and ensuing protests across the country and internationally but also strengthening the demands of protestors by giving them a platform. Performing such roles, journalists in the country are still fighting to maintain democratic principles and, in this fight, are empowered by Suu Kyi’s democratic movement. For this reason, many continue to be prosecuted by the country’s military leaders.
Protection mechanisms for journalists are rooted in democratic principles. TheUN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunitystresses the priority to create a free and safe environment for journalists around the world. An overarching purpose for this is to strengthen democracy. The Plan states a commitment to help countries develop mechanisms to accommodate freedom of expression and freedom of information – two key pillars of a democratic society. It also aims to lower impunity for crimes against journalists. This is outlined by encouraging states to be active in resolving cases of journalist deaths and responsive to the UN in providing answers for these cases. Tackling impunity, therefore, intends to heighten transparency and accountability – not just within a case itself, but also within a government responsible for delivering justice and setting a precedent for a state’s respect for democratic principles.
Through re-asserting the key role that journalism plays in strengthening democratic societies, the Plan shows that attacks on journalists are themselves violations of democratic principles, and their aftermath can be too if not resolved accordingly. Increasingly institutionalized recognition of journalist deaths, with a focus on journalists’ role in cultivating democracy, puts more organizational pressure on governments to respect and protect their country’s journalists. At best, attacks against journalists worldwide will continue to decline.2020 had the lowest number of journalist deaths, 42; a further decline from 2019’s 57 deaths. However, governments and ruling groups who tend to violate journalistic, and hence democratic, principles may simply become more covert in their methods. Furthermore, as the press-safety paradox highlights, the risk to report remains in a free and open democracy, discouraging more journalists from doing their work.
Although instruments like the UN Plan of Action still raise some doubts about their success in protecting journalists, it was only in recent years that the phenomenon of journalist deaths gained such high-profile institutional recognition. Yet, this has promptly succeeded in raising global awareness of the plight of journalists, the varying contexts in which attacks occur, and the link journalists create to the preservation of democracy. One major contributor to this raised awareness has been the recognition that most journalist attacks occur internally within a state, against local media workers, rather than against foreign reporters covering international cases, which typically gain the most public attention. This, therefore, increases public discourse on the press-safety paradox and how states’ internal democratic instruments are either upheld or violated.

Trans Lives in the Visegrad Four: An Overview,"According toGLAAD, the term ‘transgender’ describes an individual whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. More specifically, gender identity is a person’s internal and personal sense of being a man or a woman, or for some individuals who do not feel like they fit into either being a man or a woman, a non-binary identity might best describe who they understand themselves to be. The term ‘trans’ encompasses both transgender and transsexual, which can describe someone who has undergone a gender reassignment through medical processes. It is important to understand that not all transgender individuals go through, or want to go through, sex reassignment.
Central European nations belonging to theVisegrad Four (V4)–  The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia – are often some of the most politically and socially conservative members of the European Union. However, each of these nations is different in their treatment of and history with trans individuals.
The Czech Republic is generally considered to be one of the most progressive states within the Visegrad Four. One distinct marker of Czech society is the lack of dominant religious values. Unlike Poland or Hungary, the secular nature of the Czech Republic generally exempts them from religiously-motivated homophobia. Hot button issues like same-sex marriage have garnered enough attention and approval to receivelegislative responses. That said, when focusing more closely on trans rights, there remains a discomfort with non-binary identities, likely rooted in traditional attachment togender and race norms.
The issue of forced sterilization lies at the heart of the Czech Republic’s categorization as a ‘red state’ byTransgender Europe, and like the rest of the V4 nations, legal gender recognition requires amental health diagnosis, which further stigmatizes and discriminate against the ability to freely dictate one’s gender through self-determination.The requirementto be diagnosed with transsexualism by a sexologist and a physician qualifies the individual for hormone treatment. Once the transition initiates, the individual must select a temporary gender-neutral name to use during their ‘trial year’ in the new, chosen gender. After this year, the individual must appear before a panel of doctors, psychologists, and lawyers, who determine if the individual is in the appropriate mental state to qualify for gender reassignment surgery, and it is only after this surgery that the individual can apply for document changes to reflect their chosen gender.
These types of policies have ramifications in trans individuals’ everyday lives including extreme difficulties with official documentation. Forced sterilization is expensive with the average cost of female sterilization being roughly5,000 euros, and male sterilization (vasectomy) being at least500 euros.Other life-altering legislationincludes forced divorce, which greatly impacts an individual’s personal life and often is not what that individual would choose for themselves or their partners.
The process is complex and has the potential to make those in the midst of it feel isolated or ostracized, and the future of trans rights in the Czech Republic remains uncertain. While there was amajor legal victoryagainst forced sterilization was brought jointly by Transgender Europe and ILGA-Europe in 2015, in which the court determined that it was a violation of human rights, the Czech Association of Sexologists held firm in its belief that castration should be a legal requirement in the formal gender recognition process. The case was brought up under the European Social Charter, and may take time before anything really changes. Further, there remains a fear that, in the wake ofrising nationalism and neo-nazismin the region, such movements could have a lasting influence on the societal positioning of trans rights in the Czech Republic.
Hungary is one of the worst-performing countries when it comes to the protection of trans rights. In May 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, the Hungarian parliament passed a law that defines gender-based on “sex at birth”,thus legally not recognizing trans identities.
This new law is not big news to the Hungarian trans community as the legal gender changes have been halted since 2017. Now, all the requests accumulated throughout the years will be denied. The piece of legislation is not only hindering people who just began their transition, but also trans men and women who have had their documents legally changed before. With the wording “sex at birth”, every trans personis in danger of being outed by their official documents.
The Hungarian government’s feelings towards the LGBT+ community did not get better in 2021. In January, Orban’s government decided to pass a bill forcing publishing companiesto introduce a disclaimer on bookswith topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity. Due to this hostile environment, many LGBT+ people, especially trans individuals, are taking advantage of European mobility and moving to EU countries with more favorable legislation. In an interview withAgence France-Presse, Ivett Ordog, a 40-year-old engineering manager, recounted the reasoning behind her relocation and it is correlated to the anti-trans bill passed in May. Ordog stated that the constant coming out in public places puts trans people in danger, “usually nothing bad happens, but every time you have to prepare for the worst, when you are outed in front of staff or a large audience, you never know if someone might come after you”.
In March 2019, Swidnik was one of the first municipalities to start to declare themselves as “free of the LGBT ideology” (Strefa wolna od ideologiiLGBT). The municipalities were passing motions that rejected what they considered “LGBT ideology” in their homes, workplaces, and, most importantly, schools. These resolutions passed, at first, in the rural and conservative areas of the countryto then reach a third of Poland“free of LGBT”. There were waves of new municipalities declaring themselves as “LGBT-free” and the peaks were in the months prior to the elections, both the European elections and national elections. State-controlled media has been campaigning harshly against gender minorities, byshaming and deadnaming the trans community on their outlets.
Formally changing a person’s gender identity is a lengthy and difficult process in Poland. In an interview with Vice, Anton, a Polish journalist, described the systemic discrimination when going through the process of legalization of one’s gender identity. Recalling his own experience, Anton described the various steps towards his gender transition, starting from the “really long process of diagnosis” usually performed by a psychotherapist. When the expert diagnosis gender dysphoria, then the person can have access to hormone treatments. In order to change the gender in legal documents, Anton states that part of the process is “to sue your parents for wrongly assuming your gender when you were born”. Despite Poland being known for its questionable relationship with women’s bodies (see abortion laws in Poland) and the terrible relation with its LGBT+ community, good news for transgender Poles came up in October. A Polish court ruled in favor of a transwoman, confirming that it is not permitted to discriminate against trans people in the workplace. The woman in question is Joanna, hired by a security company while undergoing the legal process of formally changing her gender identity. At the beginning of the recruitment, Joanna did not have any problem in the workplace. However, when the employer found out her documents identified her as “male”, he made her wear a male uniform and gave her humiliating tasks.This new ruling sets an unprecedented standard of protection for the Polish trans community.
While other Visegrad Four countries’ policies are more distinct, Slovakia’s general atmosphere around LGBT issues remains vague. Even though its neighbors have intense processes required to be recognized as trans, or are very openly transphobic, Slovakia’s relatively progressive nature has not been sufficient enough to make it a beacon for LGBT rights. In fact, it is actually the lack of clear legislation that provides a breeding ground for inhumane treatment of trans individuals.
As of 2016, Slovakia, unlike all other V4 countries, does not require gender reassignment treatment. However, further legal requirements are murky and are instead usually dictated by norms and individual judges, lawyers, and medical professionals. Even the government portal,Slovensko, states that ‘the transition process is not comprehensively regulated in the Slovak Republic’. Steps in the transition process that are very clearly laid out in other nations, like mandatory divorce, are not a legal obligation in Slovakia, but are still often insisted upon by healthcare providers involved in the transition.
Unfortunately, inJuly 2016, birth registries began requiring medical certifications that trans individuals had undergone sterilization, making it effectively compulsory for trans individuals to be sterile in order to change their legal documents. Even though this shift was not legislative in nature and actively contrasts Slovakia’s Criminal Code and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (2015), which both determine forced sterilization to violate human rights, its impacts are, nonetheless, real. The lack of clear legislation poses significant challenges, just like the presence of outwardly discriminatory practices because it allows for extremely liberal interpretations of the unregulated procedures. In a country where the word for ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ arethe samein the local language, the lack of clarity in the language surrounding what it means to be trans in Slovakia ultimately impacts the quality of trans lives by creating a state of uncertainty.
In September 2019, the Minister of Healthrefused to sign legislationknown as the Professional Guidelines to Unify Medical Procedures for Issuing Medical Opinions on Gender Reassignment, which had been prepared in 2019 by the previous government with the help of medical professionals and trans advocates. These guidelines would have abolished forced sterilization and other medical interventions required for legal gender recognition. This is now the third Minister to refuse to move the process forward.
Talks had continued through January 2020, until they were stalled by the elections and the outbreak of COVID-19. For now, it seems that the political and medical will to introduce proper, clarifying legislation on trans rights in Slovakia remains unattainable until there is a significant shift in citizen and governmental priorities.
The EU plays an important role in the future of trans rights in Central Europe. A court case in France that ultimately made forced sterilization of trans individuals illegal, set a precedent for the entire EU, was ultimately brought to the EU Court of Human Rights and made illegal Union-wide in2017. Practically, however, this has not been implemented Union-wide and remains effective in many countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

The Unknown Face of Yemen: A Conversation with Mariam Al-Dhubani,"TNGo contributorGreta Di Mattiaexplores the local dynamics of the war in Yemen throughout an interview with Mariam Al-Dhubani, an award-winning film-maker and journalist.
Yemen appears to be a borderland in Western knowledge of the Middle East, where just a few scholars dare to go. Thus, before losing ourselves in thisTNGOHuman Story,it is worthwhile to start with a brief historical narration. Then, through Mariam’s eyes, we will look beyond the veil of the everlasting conflict between Shiites and Sunnites – the most common interpretation of the war – and glimpse theunknown face of Yemenwith its enigmatic expression stemming from the intertwining of several, complex stories.
Located in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, the green uplands of Yemen mark the end of the large Rub’ al-Khali Desert. From the ancient Romans’ astonishment facing such a vision, stems the old name of the country,Arabia Felix(Fertile, Happy Arabia), in contrast withArabia Desertica, that is nowadays Saudi Arabia.
Why was Yemen relegated into one of the darkest corners of the Western historical narrative of the Middle East?
Well, first of all,the territories which form the country nowadays never fell under complete, prolonged domination by The Ottoman Empire. Its collapse at the end of the First World War led its provinces to make their hasty debut in the system of Nation States as protectorates, administered by the Winning Powers. While Syria, Palestine, Iraq, and Lebanon’s violent reactions to the imposition of alien socio-political models brought their histories to the international community’s attention, the mountainous territories of northern Yemen were unified under the rule of Imam Yaḥyā ibn Muḥammad who founded theMutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.
During the 1960s, the austere and isolated northern Imamate was overthrown following a Nasser-inspired revolution that established theYemen Arab Republic. In the south-east, theDemocratic Republic of Yemen, a British colony since the beginning of the eighteenth century, became the only territory in Arab history to be considered a socialist state. Nevertheless,the Arabic Peninsula never turned into a Cold War conflicttheatre. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall, these two states were unified under the autocratic rule of Ali Abd Allah Saleh who had ruled the northern republic since 1978. The multi-party system of the newRepublic of Yemengranted it the support of Western countries.
Mariam al-Dhubhani was born in 1990, the Year of Yemeni Unification
A talented,award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Mariam al-Dhubhani has lived in Doha, the Capital of Qatar, since 2015 after she left Yemen to seek a better life, far away from the war which had just erupted. While attending the Journalism and Strategic Communication Programme at the Northwestern University in Qatar, she joined the Doha Film Institute. There, she began creating powerful short films that expressed her will to live and told the story of her homeland. In this way, a new hope arose from Mariam’s nightmares, made of painful memories and a constant, latent sorrow from being separated from her family
Mariam’s father is from Taiz, a city in south-western Yemen that was once known for its lively cultural scene.Her mother is from Krasnodar, a large industrial city in southern Russia, not far from the coast of the Black Sea. They met in Kyiv, then-Soviet Ukraine, where they were both studying engineering. After completing their programs, they moved to Sana’a, the Capital of Yemen where Mariam and her siblings were born and raised. That said, when asked where she is from, Mariam smiles and says that she is from Taiz:
“My father’s family is quabili (tribal) and although tribal identity is not that important in Taiz, it is in Sana’a. Thus, despite the fact that I was born and raised in the capital, people there still consider me and my family to be from Taiz.“
Arabs Have Been Living in Organized Tribes Since the Beginning of Time.
Their establishment also predates this people’ssurrenderto the will of God, the literal meaning of the Arabic termIslam. But tribes’ antiquity has nothing to do with the Eurocentric concept that is usually employed to label non-Western customs:primitiveness.
As scholar Marieke Brandt explains in her bookTribes and Politics in Yemen,Yemeni tribes are very complex polities. They are characterized by juridical and administrative structures, written laws, and stable political alliances and represent the main models of social representation in northern Yemen and, to some extent, in the central part of the Country, where a large plain surrounded by mountains is said to be the place chosen by Shem, son of Noah, to found a new city: Sana’a.
Sana’a is a city made up of magnificent, unique buildings that struck Italian directorPier Paolo Pasoliniand led him to define Yemen as the most beautiful country in the world,calling for UNESCOto grant international protection for such an invaluable cultural heritage facing the danger of destruction. Unfortunately, his prophetic concern was well-founded.
The first civil war broke out in the north of Yemen in 2004, between the Saleh government and the Houthis, the armed group from thenorthern Sada’a governoratewhich today controls one-third of the country where70 percentof the population live. The Saudi Arabia military first intervened in 2009, then again in 2015, at the head of acoalition, initiating an international conflict which,according to the United Nations, caused the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.
Thorough analyses aimed at identifying the local roots of the war and building a durable peace process are rare. Plus, internationalmediation efforts have been addressing the crisis from a mere humanitarian perspective, failing to deal with the original motivesthat are tied to a word by which oppressed peoples in history have often called their hopes:change.
The Hope Dissolved in a Spring Breeze
When civil unrest broke out in Yemenin the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring; Mariam was in Sana’a, watching her homeland plummet into escalating violence. Saleh tried to hold his power through any means necessary against thousands of protesters calling fortagheer(change). Amongst them stood his foes, the Houthis, whose identity and specific objectives – that will soon be outlined – meddled with the general discontent towards the regime. This generated large approval  towards the rebels, notwithstanding social and tribal divisions.
Who Gave You the Right to Kill?
This is the opening verse of a song that Mariam wrote in 2014 addressed to former President Saleh and his reckless power grab at the expense of his own people. This song later became the quiet but powerful theme song of her short movieJust Another Memorywhich was produced by Academy Award-nominated director and winner of the 2018 Ajyal Film Festival for Best Documentary, Rithy Panh.
In 2012,Abd Rabbih Mansour Hadireplaced Saleh. Today, he still acts as the head of theinternationally recognized governmentthat was brokered by the United Nations and theGulf Cooperation Council. It is upon Hadi’s invitationthat the Saudi Arabia-led coalition undertook a military intervention against the Houthis in 2015 after the armed group had taken complete control of Sana’a, forcing Hadi to flee to the southern city ofAden– the current, temporary capital of Yemen – and then to Ryadh. There are many reasons why the rebels do not accept Hadi’s authority. For instance,Hadi had been Saleh’s vice-President since 1994, thus he is not exactly ahomo novusopening a path towardsTagheer.Nevertheless, the media overlooks the socio-political roots of the war in Yemen. The complex dynamics of the conflict are oftenreduced to aproxy warbetween Saudi Arabian Sunnites and Iranian Shiites, with the Houthis being the latter’s proxy.
The first one is the prejudice–  still rooted in Western culture –relegating non-Western countries to what Indian historian Dipesh Chakrabarty calls animaginary waiting roomof history. There is an expected transition from a ‘backward’ reality to a forward-looking one that shares the values of Western civilization, such as secularism. For this reason, external observers often disregard societies in which religion still plays an important role and tend to connect a conflict originating from such societies to purely religious motives. As a result, these motives are simply obscure facets that are not worth a proper, rational examination.
From the Ashes of Such a Mindset, Rises the Spirit of Mariam’s Movies
The imaginary waiting roomcauses detachment when external audiences hear about conflicts afflicting the so-called Third World. With this in mind, Mariam created her second short filmIn the Middle, which was the winner of the Ajyal Film Festival for Best Documentary in 2019 and was screened in prestigious festivals all around the world. The protagonist, Ali, is a young man from Aden who is forced to serve at a checkpoint as a soldier in order to protect his family, despite holding a degree in civil engineering. To make his burden a little less heavy, he manages to find brief moments to play with the children of his village or to chew someqat –a mind-altering flowering plant – with one of his friends.
Every viewer can sympathize with the struggles of a young person whose dreams are taken away by war, fulfilling the director’s ultimate purpose:
The mainstream media narrative portrays Yemen as nothing but a land of misery and destruction.It is necessary to denounce the desperate humanitarian situation in Yemen,but the risk of addressing just one side of the crisis without paying proper attention to its roots is to imply that such destruction is somehow inherent in Yemen and the Middle East in general, as if peace in this land was a fantasy. We are just currently living through a horrible war like everycountry in the world did in its history, we have known much more in our lives and we have much more to show to the world than death and misery.We are not without hope.
Fueling the Proxy War Narrative: the Religious Character of theBelieving YouthMovement
The second factor fueling the proxy war narrative is the originally religious character of theBelieving Youthmovement, created back in the 1990s by Muhammad and Hussein al-Huthi, members of theSadahfamily al-Houthi. TheSadahpeople are those who are believed to descend from Prophet Muhammad. They make up the religious aristocracy in every Muslim country and represent one of the social classes composing Yemeni complex society.
The Believing Youth movement’s purpose was to preserve theZaydi doctrine,a branch of Shi’a Islam, facing what was perceived as an intrusive neighborhood policy by Saudi Arabia. The latter tried to spread Salafism (a branch of Sunni Islam) in the northern Sada’a governorate, as scholar Helen Lackner explains in her bookYemen in Crisis.
However,the motives that triggered the general social unrest at the foundation of the civil war, go far beyond religion.
One motive behind the civil war, in particular, is worth mentioning:widespread poverty. While Saleh was, in Mariam’s words,treating Yemen as his own backyard, gathering amassive wealththrough a corrupt patronage system forged in 33 years of power, his people have been living in one of the poorest countries in the world. The northern governorates were the most marginalized. With the accusation ofuneven resource distribution, the Houthis – along with theSouthern separatists– rejected theregional boundariestraced in the Hadi-backed project of the new State federal configuration. The latter ignored the rebels’ demands marking the failure of the National Dialogue Conference back in 2014. Further, it pushed the northern insurgent movement towards Saleh. Thanks to this opportunistic alliance – which ended in 2017 with the former President’s assassination – the Houthis took control of Sana’a.
The Sharp Differences between Zaydi Shi’a and Twelver Shi’a
Twelvers – who represent the predominant school of Shi’a Islam and the State religion ofIran– believe that the only legitimate Imam, the twelfth in Muhammad’ lineage, is hiding. While waiting for him to reveal himself, they entrust power to thejurist(velayat-e-faqui) whose role represents the core principle of Ayatollah Khomeini’s thought and the foundation of the Islamic Republic model. On the other hand,Zaydis think that everysadahcan claim the role of Imam, based on one’s qualities, hence the Islamic Imamate could still be established as it did in 1918 with the foundation of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.
Although restoring the Imamate doesn’t seem to be on the Houthi agenda, it is clear that such a concept is definitely at odds with the Twelvers’ doctrine. This could potentially represent a threat not only for Saudi Arabia but also for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Houthis are just the lesser evil for Iran and its support for them facing Saudi Arabia doesn’t qualify the Yemeni insurgent group as a proxy, but rather brands it as anequal allyin a battle against a common enemy.
In the end, while Twelvers consider Sunnites to be heretics Zaydis think that they simply arein errorfor not having recognized Ali’, Muhammad’s son-in-law, as his legitimate heir. Therefore, Zaydis and Shafi Sunnites – who represent around 40 and 60 percent of the Yemeni population respectively –  have always lived inharmonyin Yemen, praying together in their everyday lives.
Nevertheless, the war changed everything. Distinguished Yemen scholars likeHelen LacknerandMarieke Brandthave observed howyears of violence and failed peace-building measures have further radicalized the Houthi movement and exacerbated the conflict.
Considering the long-standing international awareness ofthe effects of conventional arms proliferation, which can often represent the cause of a conflict and not only a consequence (see, e.g.UN document NC.J/4717, paragraph 17)Biden’s stop to US support for Saudi-led military offensive operations in Yemenis a first, fundamental step towards the end of the catastrophic war in Yemen and to finally shedding a light on a country which has too long been ignored by the international community.
Nevertheless, no peace-building effort will be truly effective if international organizations don’t overcomethe superficial portrayals of Yemen and the Middle East in general. In order build a durable mediation strategy, it has to involve not only regional powers but also relevant local stakeholders. Further, it needs to take into account the dynamics of radicalization of which isolation and violence are usually the cause, rather than a consequence.
The war in Yemen is undoubtedly linked to broader regional interests as well as, to some extent, religious quarrels. Butits roots are essentially plunged in Yemenis’ thirst for changein civil and political rights, education, opportunities, and equality.
When asked which Islamic branch she belongs to, Mariam smiles and answers:
My dad is Muslim, my mom is Christian and we all believe in God.That is also why I am sure that this war will come to an end andYemen will rise again, Inshallah.
Mariam also believes in the power of journalism and communication, as do we here at TNGO. That is why we thank all the readers who took the time to read this story aimed at opening a little breach in the grim blanket of indifference that, for too long, has been surrounding the war-torn, but still magnificent, walls of Sana’a.

Lula Livre! Ex-President Lula da Silva Has Conviction Annulled,"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, has had his political rights restored after The Supreme Court’s new ruling allowed a judge to annul his criminal convictions. The Supreme Court’s ruling decided that a person can only be imprisoned once all appeals to higher courts have been exhausted, arguing immediate detention violated the constitution by not respecting the presumption of innocence.
What is the history of Lula and his conviction? What does his freedom means for the political landscape of Brazil?
LULA’S LIFE
Lula governed Brazil from 2003-2010 as the leader and founding member of the Worker’s Party. Born in 1945 in Caetés, Pernambuco, he grew up as a shoe-shiner and then a warehouse worker in São Paulo. He has always been an avid union supporter, becoming President of the Steel Workers’ Union of São Bernardo do Campo and Diadema for which he was arrested under the Military Dictatorship (1964-1985) for organizing strikes.
Together with a group of academics, he founded the Worker’s Party in 1980, a left-wing progressive party. Lula and the party were heavily involved in the popular direct elections campaign (‘Diretas Já!’) which sought to put an end to the widely recognized “sham” elections that, since the 1964 military coup d’état, had only elected retired generals as Presidents in a closed military caucus. The campaign was finally successful in 1989 when the first president was elected by direct popular vote.
Lula’s presidency was marked by extensive social programs, including the Zero Hunger (‘Fome Zero’) and Family Allowance (‘Bolsa Familia’) programs which introduced large infrastructure investments, distribution of money to the poor, and raised the minimum wage well above the rate of inflation. The Family Allowance program has been praised internationally for its achievements inreducing poverty in Brazil by 27.7% in Lula’s first term.
OPERATION “CAR WASH”
An investigation began in 2014 called ‘Operation Car Wash’ (‘Lava Jato’) which eventually led to thearrest of Lula and other politicians. The investigation found that Petrobras, a state-run global oil and gas company, had been taking bribes from construction companies in return for lucrative contracts. Construction giant Odebrecht admitted to having paid around £800m (over $6 billion reais) in bribes. These bribes had allegedly been funneled into politicians’ pockets and, in particular, to the political party campaign coffers. The operation implicated the Worker’s Party and the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and led to virtually all mainstream politicians coming under fire.
Lula was one of the most senior politicians to fall under Operation Car Wash, is being accused of receiving an £800,000 apartment ($3.7 million reais) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. However, his defense argued that the ownership of the apartment has never been proven, and thus it remains only an accusation by the former chairman of OAS, who has already been convicted of corruption. Despite losing his first appeal, Lula was sentenced to 12 years in jail he was nominated as the presidential candidate for the Worker’s Party and in 2018 he was leading the polls with almost double the support of his nearest rivals.
One month before the election, an electoral court banned Lula from running on the grounds that he had been sentenced, when he held a 20-point lead over his closest rival, and current president, Jair Bolsonaro.
THE LULA LIVRE CAMPAIGN STARTS
With Bolsonaro elected and Lula in prison, Brazil’s political landscape had dramatically changedwithin the space of a month and many left-wing and international commentators were disappointed with the course of events. A movement began arguing that Lula’s imprisonment was politically motivated and unconstitutional, supported by powerful national figures such as the then president of the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (the central union of Brazil), Vagner Freitas, as well as international figures such as Bernie Sanders, Noam Chomsky, Danny Glover, and more.
Their movement was especially bolstered when the Car Wash Leaks (‘Vaza Jato’) were discovered and published byThe Interceptin June 2019 which leaked conversations from the Telegram app involving former judge Sergio Moro, the judge who sentenced Lula on the charges of money laundering and passive corruption in 2018, and other prosecutors and the Federal Prosecutor’s Office (MPF). In the leak, Moro, the judge, was shown to be the one leading the trial, not the prosecutors, giving strategic advice, informal clues, and pressuring the ruling to be sped up despite a lack of evidence. The leak showed evidence of a bias against Lula displayed by judge Moro and his appointment as Minister of Justice and Public Security by the Bolsonaro administration shortly after Lula’s imprisonment implicated his impartiality even further.
In 2020, Moro left the government citing Bolsonaro’s interference in the Ministry of Justice’s affairs and his departure was widely recognized to be due to a falling out between President and Minister.
COVID-19 HITS
The arrival of theCovid-19 pandemicin Brazil found a country heavily divided. Whilst many were supportive of Bolsonaro and he won a landslide, many felt severely ostracized from the political scene with two of the most prominent left-wing politicians, Lula and Dilma Rousseff, out of office. A staunchly right-wing politician, often compared to Trump, Bolsonaro is a divisive figure. His supporters have praised him for more than doubling the pace of economic growth (2.3%) in (pre-Covid-19) 2020 and for a decline in unemployment and homicide rates.
His critics have highlighted his implication in theinternational scandal when wildfires ran through the Amazon,a disaster enabled by his environmental policy, and possibly extended by his refusal of $22 million USD offered as disaster relief at the 2019 G7 summit. International NGOs have also highlighted at a United Nations Humans Rights Council session in March 2020 his malignant treatment of Brazilian indigenous peoples with theArns Commission finding in a new reportthat his administration’s socio-environmental policy is putting indigenous peoples at risk of ethnocide, and potentially genocide. During the pandemic, he has again be criticized for his neglectful handling of the crisis with 260,000 dead and responsibility for the second-highest death toll in the world. His Covid-19 response has also had a detrimental effect on the economy asThe World Bankforecasted Brazil’s 2021 GDP as 0.8% higher than its June estimate, not enough to offset a likely 4.5% drop in 2020 amid the world’s worst COVID-19 death toll outside the United States. Recently, the cases have increased even more with the spread of the highly contagious Manaus variant, but even with this new crisis Bolsonaro announced at an event:
“Stop whining. How long are you going to keep crying about it? How much longer will you stay at home and close everything? No one can stand it anymore. We regret the deaths, again, butwe need a solution.”
“Lula is back in the game”
Before his annulment, Lula had downplayed hopes that he would run again in 2022 as his sentence stripped him of the political right to do so. However, now that he is free, many have speculated that he will be running in the 2022 elections and thus challenge a re-election attempt by Bolsonaro (if he chooses to do so).
Lula has always been a very popular figure, leading polls and harkening support from national and international figures such as Barack Obama who called him “the most popular politician on Earth”. However, the effect of his conviction and imprisonment on this popularity should not be underestimated, with Bolsonaro’s landslide election being attributed by many political scientists as a sign of the desire for change and the end of corrupt politics by Brazilians. If Bolsonaro runs for re-election, and Lula chooses to rival him, we will be witnessing an election that “in American terms, it’s going to be likeSanders versus Trump” (Thomas Traumann).

Is Mr Putin’s Popularity in Russia Failing?,"Google’s trends data suggest Russians might have lost interest in their current leader.
Just before its demise, in the final stages of a long lifecycle, a star turns into a red giant. The red colour is caused by an influx of energy generated by the star in an attempt to resist the force of gravity which will eventually crush it. The process makes the star appear bigger and shine brighter than ever, but the end of its life is near. After four presidential tenures and one premiership, might Vladimir Putin have entered the red giant phase of his political career? Online searches would suggest so.
In the eyes of the West, the duel betweenMr Putinand Russian opposition leaderAlexei Navalnyhas been tilting in the latter’s favour of late. Mr Navalny’s admirable reserves of courage, determination and trust in democratic values have earned him hero status around the world and created hope that he can challenge Mr Putin’s hold on power.
But if Mr Navalny is to be successful in hisliberalization of Russia, what will matter more than Western perceptions is the recognition he gets in his own country. Search trends in Google, Russia’ssecond most popular search engine, seems to confirm that interest in Mr Putin is at its lowest in years, while Mr Navalny’s popularity is growing, especially after his recent poisoning and subsequent return to the country.
Over the past decade, in an effort to deny him credibility, Mr Putin has been careful not to call Mr Navalny by his name, and referred to him as ablogger or a gentleman instead. Now, in an equally self-preservatory manner, the Kremlin tries to play downthe recent protests sparked by the opposition leader’s jailing in early January. But in reality, despite the official statements,Russian authorities took unprecedented steps to repress dissent on the streets.
Becoming a popular leader is never easy, let alone in a country whose people have been repeatedly misled by their political masters. Mr Putin’s success can be explained at least partly by therelative stability and strength his presidencyprovided to a country desperate for order after the chaos of the post-Soviet 1990s and the failure of the Yelchin government. His strong-handed tactics, such as ordering a siege of the school in Beslan or ruthless dealing with adversaries Litvinenko and Nemtsov, perhaps did not endear him to all Russian people. However, they do seem to have kept them interested in their president, as did later international escapades in the Ukraine and Syria.The price for these acts internationally was increasing isolation and economic sanctions.
What nation could get tired of a strong leader? A poor nation perhaps. That’s why the dire state of the Russian economy and widespread corruption are the core topics of Mr Navalny’s efforts to demask and ridicule Mr Putin’s government. Will rising poverty and shrinking household incomes, combined with Mr Navalny’s efforts, be the forces of gravity that finally thwart Mr Putin’s star? They very well might.","March 28, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/is-mr-putins-popularity-in-russia-failing/,Kamila Koronska,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
[Analysis] How to Counter China’s Vaccine Diplomacy in the Balkans,"In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, international organizations claimed that “We will get through this together“. Despite this claim, international relations have resumed their course, more akin to an arena than a forum. This was blatantly clear when, after the approval of the first vaccines, the world became divided between thehavesand thehave-nots. In this Manichean scenario, the fragile states of the Western Balkans have had a hard time securing jabs for their populations. Showing their usuallargesse, China came to their rescue with its ‘vaccine diplomacy’.
The first part of the article will investigate the origins of China’s vaccine diplomacy in the Balkans, identifying it as the offspring of so-called ‘mask diplomacy’, which constitutes a worrisome evolution. The second part will consider the EU’s response to China’s initiatives in its ‘courtyard’. Finally, the third part will analyze the shortcomings of vaccine diplomacy. The objective is to assess whether it represents a serious threat to the unity of Europe and the current balance of power.
China’s looming interest in the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe is nothing new. The “Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries” (a.k.a. the17+1format) dates back to 2012. Since then, this partnership has resulted in the launch of several projects from intercultural exchanges toinfrastructural mega-constructions.
On their part, the economically challenged and politically fragile Eastern European countries wilfully accepted China’s support and investments. As the saying goes,beggars can’t be choosers. Furthermore, China’s economy is characterised by a surplus of unused raw materials andidle capital. As another saying goes,one man’s trash is another man’s bargain.
In this context, it’s unsurprising that,when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, South-Eastern Europe became the stage for China’s mask diplomacy. This strategy, which involves showering target countries with medical supplies, ostensibly allowed China to depict itself as a generous donor while, at the same time, trying to clear its name from the accusation of having mishandled data in the first phase of the outbreak.
Mask diplomacy, albeit unsophisticated, wasquite effective in Eastern Europe, at least in so far as the idea of China as a legitimate partner or even a savior became a popular notion. On a humorous note, it also brought about some quirky scenes, such asSerbian President Aleksandar Vučić kissing the Chinese flag.
Despite the ballyhoo, by Summer 2020 much of the fuss was over. By June, President Vučić had had afriendly meetingwith the President of the European Council Charles Michel, and by August, he was in Brussels, hat in hand, admitting that “Serbia needs the EU“. ABalkan Barometer surveyfound that 59% of the Balkans’ citizens perceive EU accession as positive.
Arguably,China’s vaccine diplomacy is inherently different from its mask diplomacy and possibly has more long-lasting and worrisome consequences.There are at least three reasons which can be cited as to why this is true.
First,Chinese mask diplomacy clashed with substantial efforts by the Western Camp to counter it. In fact, NATO activated the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC). Through its immense logistic capabilities,the Alliance was able to provide medical supplies throughout the entire Euro-Atlantic area. As for the European Union, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented “aneconomic recovery package for the Western Balkans”. Soon thereafter, the European Commission allocated€3.3 billion to the regionto confront the short-term backlash of the crisis.
Secondly, China’s PR campaign accompanying their mask diplomacy may have been noisy, but it could not make up for the fact thatmany masks and other equipment provided were of poor quality and unusable, not to mention, expensive. In a best case scenario, this was a sign of negligence. In the worst case, it was an admission of dishonesty. At any rate, China fell on its own sword and many 17+1 countries also complained thatsome of China’s past promises went unfulfilled.
Third, on a symbolic level, masks are very different from vaccines. Clearly, masks are an essential tool toconfrontthe pandemic, but vaccines are the only hope ofgetting out of it. In this way, China is confronting the EU on a particularly delicate battlefield. As a matter of fact,as the vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than expected, the EU is likely to focus its efforts on herd immunization internally. In turn, this leaves the field open for China’s ambitions in Eastern Europe.
When mask diplomacy turned into vaccine diplomacy, Serbia remained the epicenter of China’s strategy. In fact, the Serbian case is quite peculiar, as itreplicates the Chinese vaccine diplomacy model on a regional scale.In March, President Vučić announced thatSerbia will become the first European country to produce the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine.
The first million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine arrived in Belgrade in January 2021. The airplane carrying them was welcomed by President Vučić despite the fact thatthe vaccine was still pending approval by Serbia’s medical regulator. Furthermore, notwithstanding the lack of data regarding the efficacy of the vaccine, Serbia took the chance to play the lion’s share and gift doses to other countries in the region. In fact, up until that point, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, and North Macedonia had not yet received supplies ofanyvaccine.
As a side note, that says it all with regards to the quality of democratic institutions in the country. Only authoritarian governments would (and could)exploit the body of citizens for political gains. The results are mixed; while Serbia has vaccinated 29% of its population,a surge in coronavirus cases could trigger a new lockdown.
In early March,Montenegro received 30,000 doses of Sinopharm’s vaccine. In February, Serbia announced it would donate an additional 4,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine to them, as well. Contextually, Montenegro’s Foreign Minister Djordje Radulovic saidthe government had not received a single dose of EU-approved COVID-19 vaccines. In North Macedonia, the situation is even more dire. Two recent articles by the journal “La Verità” accused government officials of recurring toirregular channelsfor vaccine procurement from China.
It would be hasty to define these countries as definitely pro-China. When discussing the impact of Covid-19 on the Balkans, it’s important to remember their economic fragility. They physiologically lack the resilience of fully developed Western countries, lockdowns and restrictions are particularly dreaded, and the digitalization of the economy is a mirage. The prospect of a long-term economic crisis looms over the Balkan peninsula.
In this light, it may seem justifiable that governments are scrambling to get vaccines from any source. They know that they have to go to any lengths to acquire the precious jabs, lest the pandemic cause heavy suffering, even considering that infection rates will eventually decrease. Further,the poorest countries are the ones that are more susceptible to be left behind in the ‘vaccine race’.
President Vučić was not entirely wrong when he said that “the world is like the Titanic“, meaning that the rich would save themselves, and leave the others to their destiny if need be.The harsh truth is that, for countries like Montenegro or North Macedonia, there is no Next Generation EU. They may benefit from the occasional spur of generosity (or strategic awareness) in Brussels, but there is no grand plan for their reprise.
In their defense, Western Balkan countries did show willingness to join the WHO-sponsoredCovax system; Serbia even paid upfront for inclusion in the program, but by the time the Chinese jabs arrived in Serbia,they had received no doses through Covax. Thus, it would probably be hypocritical to single out these countries’ behaviour as a form of betrayal.
That said, it would also be hazardous to suggest that the European Union is detached from (or disinterested in) the Western Balkans.In fact, the EU is all but sitting by idly and has elaborated both short-term and strategic measures to confront China’s vaccine diplomacy. The most notable short-term measure is the launch ofa regional project, worth over €7 million, to support vaccinations. This project – in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) – comes on top of the Commission for Neighborhood and Enlargement’s €70 million package to support access to vaccines.
On the strategic level – and perhaps more consequentially – within the EU a “Group of 9” ispushing to bring the Western Balkans back on the agenda. On 5th March, the group – formed by the Foreign Ministers of Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia – wrote aletterto the EU’s chief diplomat, Joseph Borrell.The purpose of the letter was to give new momentum to the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans.The objective, of course, is to shield the region from the economic and political influence of external powers.
The process stalled when Bulgaria vetoed North Macedonia’s accession talks in autumn 2020. In this regard, the Group seems determined to give back to the Balkans their strategic dimension. Of course, the road ahead will be bumpy. Not only Bulgaria but also France has become warier and warier of further enlargement. The bloc’s demand for democratic reforms has not changed.
But reinforcements might appear on the horizon. In fact,the initiative is likely to find a favorably disposed interlocutor in U.S. President Joe Biden.The newly sworn-in POTUS has significant expertise when it comes to the Western Balkans. During the Clinton administration,he contributed to the development of an agenda for Yugoslavia. Therefore, he is very much aware of the strategic importance of the region to contrast China (and Russia) and is committed to replacinghis predecessor’s “competitive unilateralism” with Europeanism.
There are important elements hindering the Western strategy towards the Balkans. The first problem is thatthe EU is having trouble implementing its herd-immunization program. The rollout of vaccinations has hit several bumps in the road. The latest is thesuspension of the use of AstraZeneca vaccines in major European countries. As of March 17th,9.8% of the EU’s population has received at least one shot of the vaccine, and only 4.2% is fully vaccinated. This difficulty has two consequences which are advantages to China.
The second problem has to do with the overall EU posture towards China.The core issue is that the European Union is, at times, very vocal in condemning China, but then leaves its hand free in regional scenarios. We’ve seen this play out with the‘re-education’ camps for Uyghurs. Public reactions were strong and made use of harsh language, but concrete follow-up was unsubstantial.
Arguably, the opposite strategy would serve the EU much better. That is, treating China as the great power it is in its declaratory strategy, but then continue to pursue its interests at the regional and local levels. In the context of the Western Balkans, this would translate into more coherent efforts for development, democratization, and, eventually, enlargement.
Vaccine diplomacy is not without its flaws. The first issue isthe lack of transparent data. In late December 2020, Chinese vaccine developer Sinopharm saidits coronavirus vaccines showed a 79% efficacy rate. At any rate, this makes them less effective than Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots, but the real source of concern is thediscrepancies in the test resultswhich were conducted in 10 countries worldwide.
The second issue isthe lack of enough vaccines to immunize the Chinese population. By February 28th, China had administered around50 million dosesto its citizens. In relative terms, that is onlybetween the 3 and 4% of the population. Interestingly, China was the first country globally to start mass immunizations in November 2020. The slow roll-out raises the question of whether it will manage to come up with enough doses to inject its population of 1.4 billion while maintaining the capability to supply other countries.
In this regard, Professor Chen, Associate Professor at the Yale School of Medicine, affirmed that even sporadic clusters of Covid-19 infections in China could create an “urgency to vaccinate the Chinese population, adding some uncertainties to its global market supply”. Therefore, in the future, China might have to decide whether it wants to maintain this strategy, to the detriment of its own citizens.
Both issues ostensibly descend from China’s governance model itself. For an authoritarian state, it is inconceivable to subject sensitive data to public scrutiny, hence the lack of international confidence in its vaccines’ test results. The fact that China is pursuing vaccine diplomacy abroad while neglecting the health of its own people is a stark reminder thathuman security is not even an objective, let alone a priority.
After having presented the EU response to China’s vaccine diplomacy in the Balkans, and the intrinsic shortcomings of this Chinese strategy, it should be possible to answer the question of whether the latter will be the harbinger of a significant power shift both regionally and globally.
On the regional level, it appears thatChinese efforts are not resulting in any seismic shifts in the political alignment of the Balkans. The reactions underlined the dangerous tendency of South-Eastern Europe’s leaders to work both sides of the street, but this is hardly surprising considering the perilous situation these countries would face if the pandemic is not over soon. Further, the EU renewed commitment, together with Biden’s interest in the region, should be able to keep Chinese ambitions at bay.
On a global level,the vaccine diplomacy issue points out that the narrative about China not being able to build on its soft power is a bit trite, or simplistic at the very least. In fact, while nor the mask diplomacy nor the vaccine diplomacy marked a significant political realignment they did achieve some success in depicting China as a legitimate partner for developing countries.
This is particularly relevant as it shows that China’s strategy is not specifically aimed at the West. Its target is not any single country, nor the European Union, nor the West at large.Its aim is to reach the status of a global superpower, by getting on board its project struggling countries. This is the strategy that China used, for example, in Africa. There, China exploited a narrative aimed at appearing as a peer from the ‘global South’ and thus intrinsically anti-imperialist and preferable to the ‘greedy’ Western investors. Arguably, the same is happening now to the Western Balkans.
The main point is, that China’s narrative is essentially different from the West’s. Whereas the U.S. capitalized on their ability to depict themselves as the ‘city upon the hill’ China tries to build its international persona bydifferentiatingitself from the West. In other words, China does not build its strategic narrative (exclusively) by pointing out its own successes.Its strategy relies more on pointing out the West’s shortcomings and failures and then offering an alternative.
How can the EU counter China’s powerful narrative? As mentioned above, it is necessary to rework its declaratory strategy. Specifically, China must be reassured that the EU sees it as a global power, but at the same time, the Union has to pursue its strategic interests at the regional level.In the context of the Balkans, this should translate into a coherent comprehensive development and inclusion project.
As for the future of the global balance of power, political scientist Bruno Macaes affirmed that “the pandemic is not the beginning of the Chinese century“. It is the beginning of an era of rapid change, technological race, and power shifts, for sure, but the direction of this change is still unknownand Europe, together with its ally on the other side of the Atlantic, most surely still has a say in it.","April 06, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/how-to-counter-chinas-vaccine-diplomacy-in-the-balkans/,Shary Mitidieri,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"Transatlanticism 2.0: New Era, New Strategy","On February 19th, with the pandemic still in full effect, leaders of the Western liberal-democracies met virtually at the annual Munich Security Conference (MSC) to discuss a specific and closely concerning topic—transatlanticism. The conference’s theme was perfect in its timing, welcoming the newly elected President of the United StatesJoe Biden. He spoke alongside long-standing allies and international organizations onrenewing multilateral relationships and restoring the liberal-democratic West beyond the growing Westlessness occurring in the rules-based order.
Beyond the apparent pronouncements of “America being back” and European allies eager for its return, there were differences in defining how the West can move forward in a world witnessing deepening multipolarity and the return of great power politics, along with the challenges brought on by increasing climate change, economic friction, and the erosion of liberal democracies worldwide.
One factor that everyone agreed on was the need for renewingtransatlantic partnerships to tackle the various global threats. Despite the relationship approaching 72 years, transatlanticism was strained to the fullest during Donald Trump’s presidency. However, President Biden declared that the transatlantic relationship is“the strong foundation on which our collective security and shared prosperity are built” and it remains “the cornerstone of all our hopes in the 21st century,”. Therefore, can transatlanticism renew the cohesion and unity of the past? Can it offer the Western liberal democracies a new strategic front in a period of growing international power politics and fervent domestic polarisation? Yes, it can, and it must.
Transatlanticism is a blurry concept politically and strategically. Before the 20th century, states within the transregional area had different preoccupations regarding their foreign policy interests. However, due to the two World Wars,  the transatlantic region witnessed a significant integration of the states’ interests. Transatlanticism is the“common heritage and shared destiny of all the states bordering the North Atlantic.”Modern understanding of transatlanticism arrives from the 1941Atlantic Charterthat set out the American and British post-war goals. TheCharterconsists of eight clauses, each aiming for peaceful relations that would harmonize the transition of post-war Europe to avoid the pitfalls of the treaties from 1919.
“Victors claim no territorial gains, territorial adjustment, self-determination, the lowering of trade barriers for both the victors and vanquished, freedom from want and fear, freedom of the seas, and common disarmament.”
Yet, with the growing discontent between the Soviet Union and the US, and the permanence of Soviet territorial expansion in Eastern Europe, Western European states were eager and anxious to keep collaborating with Americans. As such, the principles laid out in theCharterpaved the way for theNorth Atlantic Treatyto be signed in 1949, leading to the creation of NATO, the principal international organization of the post-war order. Cohesion and unity led the transatlantic alliance to be deemed the driving force behindthe liberal rules-based order while also advancing and supporting international free trade, economic and political development, and human rights.
Hegemony in Europe was strategically important for US foreign policy at the beginning of the Cold War. A strong and united Europe under the leadership of the US, after all, enabled the US to expand its policy of containment elsewhere—namely Asia-Pacific. Such strategic focus, however, began to drift the two continents apart slowly. A common phrase used to define transatlanticism during this period was“keeping the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down,”but with Eastern Europe starting to break away from the Warsaw Pact in 1989, German reunification in 1990, and the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, transatlanticism was losing its significance. Further concerns began to arise with the gradual integration of European states into a supranational and intergovernmental actor and America’s unilateralist attitude in itsunipolar moment.
Leaders and scholars indefinitely point to the Trump presidency as the leading cause for weakening and increasing tension within the transatlantic community. However, the transatlantic drift commenced before Trump preached about a presidential run in 2015. The Americanunipolar moment, i.e. when America attempted to spread liberal democracy to the Middle East, was crucial according to some scholars. It was the pivotal event that set off the downturn of cohesion and unity the transatlantic community had shared since 1945. For the first time since the inter-war period, the European Union’s integration permitted a more vigorous and more impassioned European bloc. It heightened itsfrequency of critiques to the sole global hegemonic power’s political actions.Remarkably this was shown whenFrance threatened to vetoany UN Security Council resolution to authorize force in Iraq and whenGermany’s Chancellor Gerhard Schröderused his opposition as a re-election platform.
In 2009, there was hope for redirection and renewal of transatlanticism with the election of Barack Obama. Although he attempted to fix his predecessor’s mistakes, some scholars regard Obama’s presidency as a“real disappointment for Europe [as] his reflexes were not transatlantic at all.”Notably, his administration’s pivot to Asia, with the negotiatedTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and US naval rebalancing to support Indo-Pacific allies, compelled European allies to determine that future American foreign policy interests laid in its growing competition with China in the region. Although Obama had launched a Transatlantic Trade & Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiation, Donald Trump’s election thwarted that plan.
Unequivocally, the Trump presidency accentuated the tension among the transatlantic community by continually threatening to pull the US out of NATO because of members not reaching the two-percent of GDP defense spending mandate. He also called long-standing Allies‘delinquents’ and deliberately treatedthem as second or third-class members. European leaders, facing their own domestic polarization and the erosion of liberal democracies in Hungary and Poland, began to call for greaterstrategic autonomyfor the EU to develop their own foreign policy with continental interests at the forefront. The decision also stemmed fromTrump’s unilateral move to redeploy 6,400 US troops from Germany to Poland, showcasing his “America First” foreign policy, and his embrace of illiberal, autocratic, authoritarian leaders like Russia’s Vladimir Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, and at times, Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Although the transatlantic drift has seemingly shattered transatlanticism as a viable strategy for successful cohesion and unity between the West’s liberal democracies, its reintroduction at the MSC clearly illustrates the desire for its renewal. This is not surprising as the transatlantic alliance has created a deeply integrated and powerful partnership that one illiberal and irrational leader cannot destroy or thwart. Together, the transatlantic alliance accounts forover 40 percent of the world’s GDPand hashighly developed, technologically sophisticated defense systems and equipment that transcends its rivals, although China has closed that gap in recent years.
To ensure that the strategy of transatlanticism remains central to the relationship between the North Atlantic states, the latter needs to focus on reforming its defense and security commitments and outlook. For instance, transatlanticism needs to renew the articles of commitment found in theNorth Atlantic Treaty—Article Vin particular. Rolling back the Trumpian policies of troop redeployment and a show for greater cooperation in joint military exercises and fully encouraging a NATO summit that reaffirms defense concerns and supporting the NATO 2030 Strategic Concept discussions can showcase Biden’s and American seriousness to its assurance of commitment. To ensure that European NATO members uphold their obligation of matching the two-percent GDP mandate, President Biden should begin serious discussions that grant more ‘strategic input’ fora more muscular EU defense apparatus and leadershipwithin NATO’s structures.
The fear that a more strategic independent EU body within NATO endangering US interests is a fallacy. For one, the EU during the Trump presidency was able tostay firm on its sanctions against Russiaand saw it taking serious leads incoordinating policies to counter disinformation and cyber threats, despite pushbacks from its domestic populist movements.Unquestionably, the EU is materially and strategically prepared for greater responsibility for their region. As such, Biden can encourage theUS to back an EU military headquarters that will closely coordinate NATOoperations, strategic planning, and deployment with its North American partners. However, this readiness does not mean the end of the US-EU strategic partnership. Although the EU has increased its role and preparedness, someredundancies and inefficiencies in their capabilitiesremain. A particular area where both the US and EU struggle is in non-traditional security threats: information, data, telecommunication, and green energy technologies.
By developing a transatlantic body that focuses on these ‘frontier’ technologies, US-EU officials can align theirexport-controls and infrastructure applicationsthat avoid the growing dependency on state-own Chinese technology companies. Such emphasis is deeply possible as today’stransatlantic flow of data is one of the fastest and largest in the world. Creating multilateral hubs for ‘frontier’ technological cooperation through a transatlantic body situated in key cities that have the infrastructure and data capabilities (Frankfurt, London, Stockholm, Miami, New York, and San Francisco) can reinforce the integration of the transatlantic community and amplify its competency in taking on growing challenges.
Transatlanticism needs to transform its mandate through a new ‘Atlantic Charter’ that recognizes the need to establish a geopolitical standing for Western liberal democracies to flourish, becoming more competitive actors in resolving global challenges. Rather than continuing the relationship through a sense of obligation or entitlement, a new transatlantic mandate should force Western liberal democracies to recognize that their sharedstrategic interests in the world are deeply intertwined.
Historically, the transatlantic community has a poor track record when leaders gather; theyoften meet for short durations, resulting in generic promises of cooperation. An updated mandate should promote new regional institutions that garner specific and robust opportunities for strategic dialogues on common issues that have vital implications on the transatlantic community’s institutions of democracy, state safety, and multilateral partnerships. Among scholars and experts, aTransatlantic Council can incentivizegreater intergovernmental cooperation at head-of-state meetings, ministerial and institutional summits, and transatlantic economic partnerships.
By pushing for a new transatlantic relationship, Western liberal democracies can shore up their suspicions of being isolated in a growing illiberal and competitive global order. Further, it can pressure the emerging and established antagonist power centers to recognize the seriousness and preparedness the Western liberal democracies will take in protecting the rules-based order that they help bring about. This new transatlantic partnership will bring the bulwark of liberal democracies to showcase thatit can still maintaininternational peace and security and the principles of the free markets while also signaling that the community isamid the world, rather than apart or atop. Transatlanticism was built upon the foundation of incredible feats. One new feat is ushering in a multipolar rules-based order with liberal democracies flourishing across the world while working alongside antagonists in pursuit of resolving global threats that are too big for one state or bloc to fix.

Breeding Grounds for Religious Extremism: Isolationism vs. Multiculturalism,"Religious extremism has been at the forefront of recent political developments worldwide. While it is difficult to pinpoint one specific cause for this trend, there are some similarities across the board that can offer some insight.
France, a state which practices a very unique, specific form of separation of church and state known as laïcité, has faced a rise in Islamic extremism, forcing them to completely reevaluate their policy approach towards religious rights.
Poland, on the other hand, has mostly closed itself off from recent migration patterns that have brought waves of Muslim immigrants to Europe but have also faced religious extremism from the Polish Catholic Church. Though Poland outwardly practices separation of church and state, the Catholic Church remains in special favor with the government and has influence policies that can be evaluated as extreme, and endanger human rights at various levels.
These two cases reveal the ease with which church-state relations can allow for thedevelopment of illiberal democracyand serve as a comparison of two extremes. That is, one society that functions on the premise of ‘out of sight out of mind’ where religion is excluded from public life, but is struggling to encompass its growing Muslim population, and another case where one dominant religion often oversteps the idea of ‘separation of church and state’ and instead dictates much of what is socially acceptable, down to fundamental rights and culturally acceptable actions. Moreover, this article proves that both a society that excludes religion from the public sphere while allowing for immigration of minority communities, and one that is mono-religious, and otherwise closed off to ‘outsiders’, can both ultimately find themselves faced with religious extremism.
Laïcitéis a constitutional declaration of secularism in France which dictates that outward expression of religious beliefs in public spaces is prohibited. More recently, this has encompassed wearing religious articles, like a cross or a face-veil, in a public school or government building, in efforts to ‘equalize’ all members of society.
Laïcité, which has beena part of French law since 1905, has recently come into conflict with Muslim members of society. The surge of Muslim immigration to Europe in 2015 has in many ways reshaped the demographic makeup of French society, leaving it a more multicultural version of its former self. Although Muslims remain a minority, making up only around5% of the population, France has been hit particularly hard with the rate ofreligiously-inspired terrorist attacksdirectly linked to the Islamic State, better known as ISIS/ISIL/IS.
The intersection of laïcité and the French Muslim population is complex. While there are obvious implications for policies thatforce Muslim women to remove their hijab or burqa in public spaces,there are also other types of implications, like ostracizing Muslims in French society, particularly those belonging to the second generation.
There have beenmultiple terrorist attacks(some linked to terrorist organizations, others not) that have devastated French society in recent years, but one of the best known is theCharlie Hebdo attack in 2015. After the journal published a drawing of the Prophet Mohammed, a retaliatory attack by two Muslim brothers left 12 dead. This particular attack sparked a conversation aboutthe place of free speech in French society. While Charlie Hebdo’s publishings used cartoon depictions to criticize a variety of religions, discussions of whether drawing the Prophet Mohammed, which is against Islamic teachings, is a hate crime or an expression of free speech rose.
Therecent murder of Samuel Patyharkens back similar conflicts of freedom of speech and the place of religion in society. Similarly, it also involved showing a drawing of the Prophet Mohammed to a classroom during a lesson on freedom of speech. After Paty was murdered for doing this, a new law came to fruition known asthe Paty Law.One aspect of this law is requiring all children in France over the age of three to enroll in public school so as to curb extremist education which often takes place in private, religious upbringings, or homeschooling.
Additionally, the aim is to bring the second and third-generation Muslims into society by integration through education. The questions ofhow ethical forcing state-run educationin a democratic society is will ultimately be dictated by the results of this law. The law also targets religious and cultural norms like polygamy and forced marriage. One Muslim community leader noted that the law was“unjust, but necessary”to root out extremism.
Further, the origin of this law highlights that there is a clearconflict between the fundamental values of French society and the Muslim community. Moving forward,as Stefania Renaldi notes,France will ultimately need to fix the alienation of the Muslim community in France and find a meaningful, well-thought-out, and inclusive way to integrate their newer members of society. In the case of France, multiculturalism has proven to be a challenge because there is a conflict over values and how to approach laws in a way that addresses the struggles of the minority communities while not inadvertently (or blatantly) isolating them by targeting their religious practices specifically.
The Catholic Churchhas long been an inherent aspect of Polish culture. Particularly during the years under Soviet influence, Poles would use the Church as a gathering place for anti-communist action. The Church was a significant player, along with the Solidarity Movement, in ending the Soviet era not just in Poland, but across Central Eastern Europe. That said,the Church has always been a political actor, influencing everything from local parishes, to world movements through the papacy. In fact,Pope John Paul IIis often credited by his home nation, Poland, to be the defeater of communism. His work with US President Ronald Reagan and other world leaders during his period of rule is undeniably political in nature.
So when the communist era was over, the Church no longer had an enemy to fight but needed one to stay relevant, as it had, in public life. Naturally, analliance with the far-right political party, PiS, was the easiest way of maintaining influence because their platforms aligned so well. Strictly conservative interpretations of scripture have amounted to theseizure of women’s rights to abortionand the creation ofLGBT-free Zones, both of which are clear violations of human rights both as defined by the international community, and as agreed to by the European Union, of which Poland is a member.
Reuters foundover 140 cases over the past five yearsin whichpriests have displayed election posters on church property or discussed elections during masses. While an increasingly large number of Poles have begun leaving the Church, its political influence has encouraged and legitimized religious extremism.
A prime proponent of such extreme leanings is Father Tadeuz Rydzyk, who runsRadio Maryjaand launched a political party called “True Europe Movement” with the goal of re-Christianizing Europe. Groups like“All-Polish Youth”and“National Radical Camp”are two examples of Catholic-nationalists who regularly participate in marches, like the one that happens every year on Independence Day,which regularly turns violentand outwardly express Islamophobic, Homophobic, and Anti-Semitic ideas. As seen in the Guardian video, these groups regularly train with military-grade equipment to prepare to defend their homeland and fight in the “war” against Poland.
The intersection of the Church and government is clearly in violation ofthe Polish constitutionwhich separates the two. Unlike France, Poland hasa nearly mono-religious and mono-ethnic society, with 97% of residents being ethnically Polish and 85% being Catholic. Only 0.4% of society belongs to a religion that is not a denomination of Christianity. Therefore, domestic multiculturalism cannot be interpreted as a factor in religious extremism in Poland in the way it is in France.
Instead, Poland has isolated itself, with the government instating legislation that directly violates EU policy byrejecting non-European immigrants, and even thoughfear of a “Muslim invasion” is frequently propagated by the far right, Muslims make up only 0.1% of the population. While there have not been mass bombings or stabbings like in France, there has been widespread violence that has endangered public safety, perpetrated by groups like the All-Polish Youth and the National Radical Camp. In this way, Catholic extremism, like Islamic extremism, directly endangers public safety.
France and Poland show two completely different breeding grounds for extremism and prove that it is not a matter of how open or how closed off a given society is that makes it susceptible to extremism. Some other factors to consider are as follows:
Social isolation can be induced by real factors, like in the French case which shows a disproportionate degree of Muslim immigrants and second-generation membersliving in low-income housing. However, they can also be manipulated through the use of propaganda, as is seen in the Polish case. That is, even though some Polish Catholics (the majority in the country) have supported the creation of LGBT-free zones (a minority community), their rhetoric stillframes the majority as the victim. This is also visible in communities like the alt-right in the US, whose members frequently tout the idea ofwhite-suppression or reverse racismdespite lacking any substantial evidence that white people suffer from discriminatory practices in a systematic way in the US, while other minorities really do.
Both homegrown Muslim extremists in France and homegrown Catholic extremists in Poland share anisolated educational experience. Certain churches and mosques will propel inflammatory ideas to their followers, use religious education to spread their ideas, and can even utilize Internet-based platforms to spread propaganda. Such language may be off-putting for more neutral members, but ultimately attract those who feel out of place, discriminated against, or otherwise isolated. These messages usually include a call to action which has political and physically dangerous implications.
While both men and women participate in religious extremism, there is an overrepresentation of men inMuslim extremism. In Poland, interestingly, PiS, which we can examine as the main enabler of extremism is actually supportedby more women than men, though as is seen in the video about Paulina by The Guardian, the extremism groups themselves are also mostly comprised of men. Either way, just like the case ofPhyllis Schlaflyin the fight against the Women’s Liberation Movement in the 1960s-80s in the US, just because women are involved doesn’t make the movement good for women’s rights.
Moreover, theseextreme communities depend on traditional gender roles and older, conservative viewpointswhich use acts of violence to “defend” their ideals, glorification of a male warrior, gendered family structures with patriarchal leaders, and strict, binary definitions of gender (Poland,France). In this way, the dependence on tradition informs and upholds the ideals of these religious extremists and ends up hurting “outsiders”, women, and individuals who do not conform to their strict definitions. In the end, these are tools used by extremists to bind members to their group, and in a very cult-like manner, created savior-complexes in the men that play leadership roles. Hence, the violence of someone carrying out mass murder in the name of Islam or a protester at the November marches in Poland fighting innocent people feels he/she is doing their movement a service throughself-sacrifice and violent acts.
If the goals of the extremist groups are to eliminate all those who oppose them, any opposition to them can be interpreted as signs that the “persecuted” group (here, persecution can be real, false, or a combination of the two) is justified in their actions, but also doing the right thing. A common narrative of theCatholic faith is martyrdom and persecution,the idea that you will have to suffer for your faith in order to truly live it out. And this plays an important role in the actions of extremist groups, while also encouraging them to move farther and farther away from mainstream society to a point where they are nearly fully isolated.
In reality, if a group’s motives are that they are being excluded from society (see “Exclusion”), logically it would make sense that they would want to be seen by and legitimized by the mainstream. But the opposite is true, andthe increase in isolation only further fuels sentiments that the group is isolatedbecause they have also isolated themselves and their followers, which allows for their full, unwavering support, much like Paulina in the Guardian video. Similarly,groups like ISIL/ISIS/IS who take credit for killingsreinforce the isolation that their followers experience.

Into the Fray: Can the QUAD Function in a Contentious Indo-Pacific?,"On March 12, in a move to re-establish American foreign policy engagement with its allies and harden its strategic pivot to the Indo-Pacific, US President Joe Biden met virtually with the leaders of Australia, India, and Japan to discuss how theQuadrilateral Security Dialogue(QUAD) would focus onthe threat of COVID-19, economic cooperation and the ongoing climate crisis.Although these issues are vital to the global order’s stability, the QUAD was not designed to solve these broad and larger-scale threats.
Instead, the QUAD was mandated to act as a formal setting where the region’s dominant liberal democracies could coordinate and collaborate on a central diplomatic and military mission: maritime security. The timing of the QUAD Summit was also no coincidence, as it arrived within President Biden’s first one hundred days in office, suggesting a legitimate diplomatic maneuver to recapture American credibility in the region, along with showcasing US seriousness towards its strategic rivalry: China.
Overall, the idea of the Indo-Pacific needing to remain a “free and open” region is of the utmost importance today. After all, the region is home to60 percent of the world’s populationand is becoming theglobal economic engineof the multipolar rules-based order. Due to the problems posed by North Korea’s nuclear proliferation and the recent coup in Myanmar, the region could pay grave consequences if left isolated. More importantly, however, the QUAD members point to China’s expanding Wolf Warrior diplomacy and, at times, belligerent disregard for its neighbors’ territorial and intellectual sovereignty and economic interdependence as the primary worriment. With all this said, there is growing debate around whether the QUAD can produce a realistic strategy for promoting the interests of the Indo-Pacific’s liberal democracies.
The QUAD is areincarnationof the 2007 Quadrilateral Initiative led by then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The old partnership established a vague premise ofregional security and, on one occasion, held joint naval exercises. However, with then-Australian Prime Minister John Howard ousted from office that year, and the presidency of George W. Bush concluding the following year, the initiative was put on hold. In 2017, it re-emerged when then-USPresident Donald Trumprevived the partnershi, albeit without consistent results.
With the effects brought on by the Trump presidency, the growing erosion of liberal democracies worldwide, and Chinese regional hegemonic ambitions,President Biden has reoriented the QUAD as the centerpiece of his administration’s new Indo-Pacific strategy. Unlike the 2007 partnership, today’s QUAD inhabits a deepening multipolar global order and a complex Indo-Pacific regional hierarchical structure that observes the return of great power politics, nuclear proliferation, along with intellectual, technological, and economic frustrations.
TheQUAD has committeditself to “promoting a free, open rules-based order that is rooted in international law, thereby advancing security and prosperity, while also countering threats both in the region and abroad.”
Unlike the transatlantic relationship that developed into NATO,the QUAD partnership has nolegal or formal treaty commitmentsthat proclaim a collective security arrangement in the wake of armed conflict on one of the four members. Furthermore, unlike the transatlantic region,the Indo-Pacific does not have the diplomatic, political, or strategicarchitecturefor the QUAD members to pursue a collective, multinational, and multilateral response to direct and belligerent armed attacks. Instead, the region is observed through formal, traditional USbilateral and trilateralalliances with South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand, which share foreign policy interests in the stabilization and flourishing of the East Asian and Western Pacific regions. Meanwhile, India’s inclusion into the QUAD also showcases how the partnership is not a formal alliance, as the former’s political and strategicinterestsfocus more significantly on the Indian Ocean and the Southeast Asian geopolitical periphery.
With no such formal treaty commitments, why is the QUAD’s return so prolific?The partnership’s renewal as a meaningful regional organization is due to mounting Chinese regional hegemonic behaviors and antagonistic policies that havealienatedthe QUAD’s four members while also harming the region’s institutional laws, norms, and rules. With China’s regional hegemonic status causing such diplomatic and military tension, the QUAD members have acknowledged that better state cohesion and unity support a stronger outlook in dealing withChinese aggression. Coupled with their shared interests in maintaining the region’s “free and open” standing through the stiffening of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, the QUAD has a universal inclination for greatercooperationto fulfill this mission.
Notably, the Indo-Pacific was not a region that heeded significant strategic attention before then-US President Barack Obama’s ‘pivot’ to Asia.Traditionally, US foreign policy interests focused on the greaterNortheast Asian and the broader Pacific regions, as they had significant American military personnel, bases, and ports that served US geopolitical interests during the Cold War and American hegemony during itsunipolar moment.
Strategic focus on the Indo-Pacific region began in 2007 when Japan proclaimed to India that the Pacific and Indian Oceans brought about“seas of freedom and prosperity.”The region was further legitimated when Australian foreign policy began referencing the concept to indicate their geopolitical interests in the region as it promoted greater political and diplomatic avenues for trade and defense partnerships. When President Obama adopted the concept for his administration’s strategic ‘pivot’ it was clear that such a decision toreframe the East Asian regionwas to serve the one overriding issue the four countries shared:diluting China’s hegemonic authority and strength in Asia.
For the QUAD to have any realistic strategies on China and towards a “free and open” Indo-Pacific,the partnership needs to examine Chinese belligerence and aggressive hegemonic aggrandizement within the pretext of East Asia’s regional order. Despite ongoing studies attempting to identify the type of polarity the region exhibits(Ashley Tellis asserting the region’s multipolarityand some US foreign policy experts arguing its bipolarity) the distinct presence of Chinese positional, geographical, and hegemonic power confirms its claim of regional hegemony. As such,the region should be observed as unipolardue to China’s apex of power and the inability of neighboring to match the military, positional, or economic capabilities to dismiss China’s regional hegemonic ranking.
China’s adamant pursuit for regional hegemony also highlights the historical nature of the region’s hierarchical structure. East Asian history is full of examples of regional hegemons being primarily concerned with shaping the order’s political, security, and economic preferences: the Ming dynasty, European colonizers, the Japanese Empire, and post-war America. China’s assertiveness, therefore, can be better understood through itsrooted intellectual and political experiencein Asian geopolitical history. Such pretext offers an alternative outlook towards Chinese expansion in East Asia. It can also inform the QUAD of how China can react to such attempts to incorporate East Asia with Southeast Asia, understanding thatChina will inhabit an order surroundedby hostiles, rivals, and non-aligned states.
Despite China’s regional hegemony, its neighbors are by no means weak or incompetent in their ability to project powerin defending state sovereignty and regional institutional rules, norms, and laws. For instance,Japaneseresources and technological wealth,South Korea’stechnologically driven industries, and a dynamic and determinedVietnam, along with their own defense and military capabilities, possess the resilience needed to stand up to a belligerent regional hegemon. The shortfall among these states are conflicted histories that have hampered inclusiveness and strategic cohesion. Due to this impactful feature, the region’s middle and small powers have urged extra-regional hegemons, traditionally the US and now India, to provide leadership in framing a strategy to balance China.
The QUAD partnership going forward needs to focus on a realistic strategy that employs diplomatic and defense tactics that can inform the regional order’s norms, laws, and rules around Chinese hegemony. Such strategies need to make it clear that a rules-based structure is required for mutual benefits while adjusting China’s hegemonic responsibilities to the latter’s endurance. China failing to correspond with this request would result in more Indo-Pacific states looking towards the QUAD for political, economic, and structural support.
Although intelligence sharing and joint naval exercises are logical strategies to employ, the QUAD is not NATO. Moreover, with China enacting a modernized and zealous hegemonic strategy, the QUAD needs to focus on non-traditional and unordinary tactics to make China recognize its one-sided diplomacy as harmful and destabilizing to the regional order. Tactics should also encourage lower-tiered states to trap Chinese regional leadership and authority to the order and criticize China when it abuses its hegemonic privileges. Given that hegemonic statuses are based on positional and geographical traits, China needs to be informed that there arenormative elements to its sought-after title: recognition and fellowship by the region’s lower-tiered states.
The QUAD should also design strategies that assist partners that come under conflict with China. Recently, Australia and South Korea were targeted througheconomic boycottsto weaken political support and partnership with the US. To collectively depose such behaviors and help the states affected, the QUAD should establish areserve fundthat provides financial assistance to those under pressure.  This could strengthen the cohesion, unity, and credibility of the QUAD and also showcase the limits of Chinese soft power going forward. This may have the advert effect of increasingly illustrating theunwavering stance that the Indo-Pacific’s middle and small powers can take to cooperate and collaborate with the QUAD, despite retaliatory political pressures from China. Such measures can also be directed to intellectual, territorial, and governmental sovereignty. The QUAD should also deepentechnological, pharmaceutical, and telecommunicationnetworks that can serve as an alternative channel for QUAD members and other Indo-Pacific states to access if they are under threat from Chinese hegemonic belligerence.
The QUAD will also need to be pragmatic about where and when theyratchet up pressureon Chinaby being aware of the Indo-Pacific region’s risk-to-reward ratio. Exacerbated byscarce military bases, personnel, and portsthat the US, Japan, and Australia have in the Indian Ocean, the QUAD cannot negate precious resources and personnel from East Asia, thereby stretching its capabilities thinly across one supra-regional area. Instead, the QUAD needs toevaluate thestrategic significanceof Chinese hegemonic projectsin the Indo-Pacific. Such attention can be directed at theimpact of projectsover a specific period and determine if it merits an immediate threat. Although this is a gamble, China does not hold indefinite resources to continue such projects in perpetuity. Sooner-than-later, the Chinese hegemonic machine will slow down, and at that moment, China will have to reflect upon its position in the regional order, its relationship with its neighbours, and its great power companions.
Lastly, the QUAD needs to avoidzero-sum strategiesthat solely seek to undermine Chinese hegemonic primacyby forcing the Indo-Pacific to choose between its members or China. The Indo-Pacific is at a crossroads, as many states have significant economic relationships with China, often being the number one trading partner, while also having bilateral security and defense agreements with the US. As a result, it will be difficult for states tosacrificeone partner for the other. Thus,QUAD strategists must recognize that apolicy of coexistenceand patiencethrough cooperative and competitive conditions is needed to manage regional stability and, in turn, manage Chinese aggressiveness.

“Da 5 Bloods”: Reflections on African-American Soldiers in the Vietnam War,"There is a strange duality when analyzing the role of veterans in the United States. Indeed, for a nation that often fancies itself and bases a great share of its pride on its important military apparatus, the issue of veterans – and in particular veterans of color – opens a problematic dichotomy in the United States. From decorated war heroes to outcasts of society left without any social welfare and care from the country they have fought for and died to protect. Hence, with the recent Veteran’s Day in the United States, it is important to ponder on this issue. In this context, few are able to open up to the general public these issues of race struggles in the US as the master of Cinema Spike Lee, and his 2020 movie “Da 5 Bloods”.
On the surface, the movie follows a company of Vietnam veterans coming back to Ho Chi Minh City in the present day, to retrieve the spoils of their fallen commander, as well as secret cargo left there in the past. In reality, Spike Lee uses this war drama as a way to take a hard look at the treatment of veterans of color in the United States, and the general situation of black minorities in the post-Trump society.
At the core of the movie stands the difficult situation of war veterans in the United States. Based on a 2015 report by CNN, troubling data emerged which saw veterans being twice as likely as the average American to be homeless. According to the Veterans Affairs (VA), approximately 70 percent of homeless veterans suffer from substance abuse problems, and some 45 percent are suffering from mental illnesses, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This stems from a general situation of lack of welfare and issues with re-integration that veterans suffer since their return from the front lines.
Indeed, further data from this analysis shows that, according to the Bureau of Labor, of the country’s 21.2 million veterans, only half was properly employed; while over 10 million were not even looking for employment. Hence, according to this investigation, it becomes clear how veterans become desensitized and detached from society once they are back home, causing them to resort to substance abuse or live in extreme conditions of poverty.
These statistics have only gotten worse during the Trump administration. Indeed,millions of former soldiers and often wounded of warshave had their health-care coverage eroded, as Mark Esper proposed a budget cut of over $2 billion to the Military Health System. This would undermine the quality of medical care and related specialized research. Also, the expanded outsourcing of care by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has created the same negative impact on nine million veterans – a precarious situation which has been further destabilized by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as by race-based discrimination that has surged over the past years in the United States.
It is from this background that “Da 5 Bloods” sets its drama. The film initially lulls the audience into thinking that this is going to be a light-hearted reunion between old friends; only to then transform into a hard-hitting war drama that does not shy away from tackling many social and racial issues plaguing the United States today. From PTSD to drug addiction and political extremism, “Da 5 Bloods” paints a true and hard picture of the situation of veterans in the United States. It represents yet another attempt by director and ‘Maestro’ Spike Lee to hit clear on issues that most prefer to overlook.
The film is introduced through a compilation of speeches delivered by real-life, prominent figures who protested the Vietnam War.Muhammad Alideclares the War as a fight “for big, powerful America”, a fight in which, unlike the United States, ‘the enemy’ “never called me ‘n*****’…never lynched me…didn’t rob me of my nationality”.
Malcolm Xmirrors the draft of Black men with the unjust treatment of Black people in America throughout the country’s history: “When you take twenty million Black people and make them fight all your wars and pick all your cotton and you never give them any real recompense, sooner of later their allegiance towards you is going to wear thin”.
Angela Davisstresses the link “between what’s happening in Vietnam and what’s happening here”, with “here” being the US at the time. She warns of “full-blown fascism”. Finally, leader of the Black Panther Party,Bobby Seale, reiterates: “Now here we go with the damn Vietnam War, and we still ain’t gettin’ nothin’ but racist police brutality, et cetera.”
Spike Lee immediately presents to us the anti-Vietnam War movement as part and parcel of the War itself. On a day like Veteran’s Day, the film serves as an eye-opening reminder of the broader social dynamics, primarily of race and class, that comprise a War played out on the other side of the world. Through real-life footage, as well as character experiences, we gain an insight into the racial discrimination faced by African-American men, that led to a high number being drafted into a war where they represented a country that, in reality, they made up only 11% of. “White boys who stayed in college, they’d dodge that shit. They put our poor Black asses on the frontline, killing us off like flies.”
One of the most significant moments in the film occurs when the group of soldiers listens to a Radio Hanoi broadcast. Hanoi Hannah announces the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. She emphasizes the revolutionary’s position in the anti-War movement, by addressing how Dr. King “heroically opposed the cruel racial discrimination in the USA” and “the US War in Vietnam”.
It’s not just that the War was unjust in itself;the film underlines the inextricable link between injustices faced by African Americans in the War and the injustices they face in the US. The use of Dr. King in the storyline brings us face-to-face with the fact that a Black public figure affirmed this link, yet was killed for it in return. Perhaps Veterans Day should also be an occasion to recognize the crucial voices surrounding the Vietnam War, voices who spoke to defend the helpless men sent off to fight it.
Although “Da 5 Bloods'” predominant focus is on the Vietnam War and the US’ involvement in it, the film also comments on the United States of America as we know it today. Spike Lee offers his two cents on an area that has been under a particularly close microscope over the last year: the US police, police brutality, and institutionalized racism.
“I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it’s some kind of police state”; “Your soul sisters and soul brothers are enraged in over 122 cities. They kill them while you fight against us”; “We still ain’t getting nothing but racist police brutality”. Statements spoken throughout the film, by real and fictional characters, reveal to us the prevailing issues of American society; issues which occur today just as they occurred then.It is clear the film is allied with the anti-Vietnam War movement.
However, it also serves a dual role of joining conversations reignited by recent worldwide protests calling out police brutality and institutionalized racism, namely: Black Lives Matter. Whether the film was popular enough to provide a sizable contribution to the modern movement is debatable. Yet, “Da 5 Bloods” does contribute an insightful critique of US society which, in retrospect, still shares a vast number of similarities, in regards to the treatment of African Americans, between past and present.
Tied with this is Spike Lee’s lens of Trump’s America. A relatively minor, yet vivid, symbol throughout the film is Paul’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat. The mere presence of the hat creates a space for contemporary conversations about Donald Trump, new-wave nationalism, and the USA from an international perspective. In its simplest form, the hat is a symbol of the US. This is telling of its negative reception by other non-American characters in the film, such as the French businessman Delroche, or the Vietnamese officers who intercepted Paul and his friends in the jungle. Spike Lee was not afraid to cast a light on the reputation that Donald Trump and his MAGA movement created for the US beyond its borders. This enables a lead into conversations on US imperialism, as this reputation begins to closely mirror the US’ reputation at the time of the Vietnam War.
All-in-all, Da 5 Bloods is a unique, modern war drama that offers an insightful look into the racial and societal dynamics of the US war in Vietnam, and how such dynamics prevail in the US today. At its surface, the film showcases the harsh realities of the War for all those reluctantly involved in it. This however leaves space for a critique of commemorations of the War – commemorations which often glorify, or attempt to conceal, such realities. In doing so, “Da 5 Blood”’s 2020 release has served as a fitting addition to ferociously reignited conversations surrounding race relations in the USA.

"#MeToo, What’s Next Greece?","Sexual assault has a voice in Greece, and it demands to be heard. Olympic sailing champion Sofia Bekatorou began 2021 by breaking her silence and publicly coming out as one of Greece’s many sexual assault victims. Her story flooded all media channels revealing that she was raped at 22 years old, by the former vice president of the Hellenic Sailing Federation, Aristides Adamopoulos. He responded that Bekatorou’s allegations were“false, defamatory and deceitful,”in a letter to the Olympic committee.
Now, almost three months later, theGreek #MeToo movement is a reality. Bekatorou’s courageous step inspired numerous personal testimonies from other sexual assault victims, thus exposing the brutal reality for women all over the country. By sharing her story, Bekatorou catapulted Greece’s #MeToo movement into the public eye, demanding to finally be heard.
Gender inequality and gender-based violence is an all too familiar reality for women all over the world. 1 in 2 women in the EU has experienced sexual harassment at least once in their lifetime from the age of 15, according to the largest survey on gender-based violence in Europe(FRA, 2014).Greece falls dangerously low with data concerning equal opportunities and views on women and ranks last in the EU on the Gender Equality Index With 52.2 out of 100 points, 15.7 points below the average EU score(EIGE 2020).
These dismally low numbers indicate a morecomplex societal and institutional attitude towards the perception of women in Greece. An example can be found within education. Astudysurveying the content analysis within Greek textbooks in public schools reveals that “men were represented as ‘capable’ and ‘active’ in public life, while women were considered as ‘less active’, with less knowledge and fewer skills for public activities. Additionally, male persons were linked to 224 occupations, whereas female ones to only 35 occupations, the vast majority of which are traditionally associated with low-status female work”(Gouvias, D., & Alexopoulos, C. 2016).
These examples of views towards women are systematically ingrained within the public-school sphere; however, shifting from education to security, there are telling indicators of harmful prevailing attitudes towards women and gendered violence in the Greek police force, too. Data reflecting police attitudes towards domestic violence reveals another difficult option for women where “81% of policemen believe that in cases of small-scale domestic violence (verbal violence or aggressive behavior) namely “light” violence, the couple should find a way to resolve its differences in order to preserve the family/ relationship.” In fact, “the majority (75%) of the questioned police officers reported that they have attempted to change the opinion of a woman in order to reconcile with the perpetrator, but only in cases of verbal/psychological violence and only when the episodes were not repetitive.”(Papamichail2019).These numbers reveal a complex mixture of cultural and structural factors in Greek society that need to be addressed. Stereotyping and socialization are reinforced in instances such as the above, which partly contribute to the perpetuation of gender-inequality.
The Greek #MeToo wave functions as amechanism for demystifying perpetrators across the country. Abusers take the form, shape, and name that belong to them; they are employers, colleagues, journalists, famous actors and directors, and sports agents who have repeatedly been undisturbed in their actions as silence and complicity prevailed. Women are now publicly sharing their painful experiences of abuse and violation and working through their individual, but also collective, trauma.
The Greek #MeToo has provided a source of solidarity for women, and victims at large, of all backgrounds, but it has also highlighted the need to banish the country-wide silence pertaining to these realities. Finally, the creation of a public dialogue because of the #MeToo movement has shifted feelings and ideas of guilt. Initiatives such asSexHarassMapare up and coming; created by Greek women for nationals to feel safe enough to report incidents they have experienced or witnessed, as well as find helpful information on where to turn for psychological and legal help.
Victims speaking out truthfully through social media is a way ofshifting the public narrative into their own handsand using it as a powerful tool to break collective silence and distorted news reporting. This situation is not something new, of course. It is only now, aftercontinuous pandemicand economic crisis, that people have found the courage to collectively give voice to this reality and continue to highlight the importance of it.
Collective ownership of cultural change relies on enabling and supporting those who are aware of or witness to sexual harassment to intervene in the promotion of intolerance.
In order to begin taking further action to change the cultural environment in which sexual harassment is prevalent, it is important to allow room for victims’ stories to be heard and continuously accessible, so as to create a wider understanding of this toxic reality. Gendered harassment can no longer be normalized, justified, and made invisible. Bekatorou’s nightmare has set the tone for expectations of accountability and action within Greece.

Ethiopia Tigray Crisis: Where are the Human Rights of It All?,"Ethiopia’swar in the country’s northern region of Tigray continues as the federal government sustains its battle with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against the TPLF on November 4, 2020, following reports of military strikes by the party on a government military base. This drove a series of antagonisms between the federal government and the TPLF, as the two sides were in disagreement over the balance between central and regional powers in Ethiopia.
Over five months later, fighting between the rivaling forces has continued across the Tigray region. This has left millions of Ethiopians displaced, in dire need of humanitarian assistance, vulnerable to human rights abuses, and, in some cases, killed. Refugees residing in the country, mostly from neighboring Eritrea, have been equally exposed to these dangers, impairing their stability and quality of life further.
Abiy Ahmed declared victory in the war, on behalf of the federal government, in December. The Ethiopian military claimed to have recaptured much of the Tigrayan territory. However, in certain areas of the region, forces continue to launch attacks against members of the TPLF, and vice versa. Meanwhile, civilians continue to suffer. Ethiopia’s central government, while continuing to fight the TPLF over territory and power, assured civilians would not be harmed. Yet,the situation has molded into a humanitarian crisis. It is, therefore, not out of the question to suggest political gains take precedence over human rights. In a country with an already unstable political arena and fragile structures upholding human rights, the achievement of such gains exacerbates human rights violations further.
The Tigray crisis contributes to the country’s pattern of post-reform (that is, after Abiy Ahmed became Prime Minister) political instability. As Mekuriya and Tesfaye (2021) point out, human rights were already endangered in Ethiopia, even in recent years, due to ongoing political instability in the country. This instability was primarily caused by political differences among the country’s political parties, ruling factions, and non-state actors.
The Tigray War encapsulates this political difference, in which the central and regional governments antagonize federal powers. It is a culmination of existing ethnic tensions in Ethiopia, in which Tigrayans, as a minority, fight to reclaim power. Abiy Ahmed’s ‘reform’ government was expected to work through this instability, having previously expressed goals to unite the country. However, the onset of the Tigray War has thus far contradicted this. Moreover, in aggravating ethnic tensions, the conflict has served as an arena for other minority militia groups to take advantage of a volatile region and inflict their own violence, to ultimately further their own political aspirations as minorities.
Abiy Ahmed’s promise of a “bloodless campaign” to overpower the TPLF quickly failed amid increasing reports of civilian deaths. At the beginning of April,video footageemerged of a massacre carried out in Tigray, in which fifteen civilian men were killed. Evidence points to Ethiopian military personnel as responsible for the murders of the victims, which are believed to be Tigrayans. The footage shows one of the killers proclaiming “not even one of them should be spared”. Additional reports of civilian disappearances from regional towns and villages, as well as further abusive campaigns carried out by allied groups to the warring sides, contribute to rising concerns that the conflict is far from bloodless. The Government has defended the recent video footage, claiming it “cannot be taken as evidence”. However, such reports provide a substantial case for the existence of severe human rights abuses as an effect of the national conflict.
The domestic nature of the conflict is complicated by the presence of foreign allies. Eritrean troops have fought alongside the central Ethiopian military, against the TPLF. The involvement of Eritrea has inflamed human rights abuses surrounding the conflict. Reports quickly surfaced of Eritrean soldiers being abusive to civilians in Tigray. Furthermore, retaliatory action by the TPLF, in the form of attacks on Eritrean airports, has meant that the conflict has surpassed Ethiopia’s borders, and with it, human rights abuses.The Tigray War is close to qualifying as an international human rights crisis.The UN has previously ordered Eritrean troops to leave Tigray, however, this hasfailed to happen.
Mekuriya and Tesfaye (2021) emphasize that post-reform human rights violations in the country are primarily enacted by non-state actors.Although the Tigray conflict has presented several grey areas, the state appears to be just as complicit in human rights abuses as third parties.Ethiopia’s military has been accused of human rights abuses in Tigray just as insurgent groups and external parties have. The recent video footage of Ethiopian militants murdering civilians is one such case.
Another alarming effect has been the displacement of Ethiopians from Tigray, who have been forced to flee into neighboring countries; some 30,000 have crossed into Sudan. This also concerns Eritrean refugees who were already residing in Ethiopia, and have now been forced to flee yet again. Humanitarian agencies, such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have been present in Sudan, working to provide emergency supplies and infrastructure. However, as well as struggling to locate all refugees, they have faced issues with accessibility and logistics, contributing to increased difficulty in delivering necessities to everyone that needs them.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC)has joined the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in kickstarting an investigation into alleged human rights abuses throughout the Tigray war. The announcement stressed that “all parties” would be investigated, in an effort to provide accountability for victims. The US has opened an independent investigation into the human rights abuses reported throughout the Tigray crisis. The State Department has also called for dialogue between the Ethiopian government and TPLF, on the basis that humanitarian aid should be prioritized. The G7 has voiced collective concern over alleged human rights abuses, also calling for an investigation. Abiy Ahmed’s government has thus far tried to refuse foreign interference. International organizations demanding unrestricted humanitarian access to conflict zones have faced difficulty in gaining this access.
Politically unstable, the country needs to protect its sovereignty. Heightened concerns over human rights abuses throughout the conflict, however, place this at odds with complying with international standards of human rights. The central government is all too aware of this through its adverse response to foreign interference. Yet, it appears that this response is directed at interference from specific nations, rather than from organizations. We see this through the EHRC’s efforts to cooperate with the UN. Nevertheless, this is still likely to be a surface-level response.Ethiopia has only been free from its colonial past since 1991. With the further transformation brought by Abiy Ahmed’s government, its steps towards full independence need to be free from external pressure, regardless of whether there is an ongoing domestic conflict or not.
The presence of aid organizations in Tigray ironically places the enforcement of human rights at risk. Despite assuring that the federal government is working with organizations to deliver necessary protections, Ethiopia’s central leadership could expel these organizations if their efforts begin to hinder the government’s political aims or damage its global political image. Abiy Ahmed has outlined his efforts to facilitate humanitarian aid on the ground, yet has not answered to the reports provided by those very same organizations, which reveal human rights abuses carried out by the warring sides. As a matter of fact, as much as they are providing aid on the ground, humanitarian organizations play a crucial role in reporting on developments in the conflict, including any new aggressions, the groups/individuals responsible for such aggressions, and whether they harmed any civilians.
Amid reports that civilians in Tigray are being subjected to violence and abuse, and are being prevented from adequate care, we can begin to conclude that there is still neglect of complete protection of human rights in Ethiopia.This can be attributed to the country’s political transitions in the past three decades, and a determination to solidify its footing as a nation in control of its destiny.Nonetheless, if it wants to sustain international legitimacy as an independent and democratic nation, the federal government will soon need to accelerate efforts to safeguard human rights in the country by conforming to internationally set standards of human rights, hence cooperating with international organizations.

"“Ni Una Más”: Creating an Inclusive, Impactful Feminist Movement in Mexico","Violence against women plays an unfortunately prevalent role in many cultures. In fact, physical security for women remains an exception to the norm worldwide.
In the case of Mexico, recent protests onWomen’s Day2021 might seem like a sudden, unprecedented upsurge in activism against femicide, but the momentum behind this movement has been building for years. A recent Netflix documentary entitled “Las Tres Muertes de Marisela Escobedo” sheds light on what began as a small, local protest and ended up contributing to the growth of a movement that now encompassestens of thousandsof women all over Mexico.
Maria Escobedo’s three deaths are the death of her daughter Rubi, who was brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend, the symbolic death Rubi experienced when the court acquitted her killer, and Maria’s own death, when she was shot on the command of her daughter’s killer outside the Government Palace of Chihuahua, where she was protesting. Her daily marches from 2008-2010 to protest the acquittal of her daughter’s killer took her from Ciudad Juarez, near the US border, all the way to Mexico City, in Central Mexico.
This documentary sheds light on the role corruption and bureaucracy play in “denuncias”, the police reports filed against the perpetrator of the violence. One study suggests that99% of all cases(harassment, abuse, rape) go unreported and it is common knowledge that most of the cases that are reported are passed over with impunity and simply drop off, completely unpunished, as protestors note in the video below.
This Vice report also sheds light on the negative impact that Covid-19 has had on the already challenging situation. More time at home has meant higher levels of domestic violence and even an increase in ordered killings of women.
On top of all of this, the government has done little to nothing to address violence. In fact, President Obrador previously alleged that90% of domestic violence calls are illegitimate, a baseless and damaging claim that only helps perpetuate the belief, which he shares, that the feminist movement is being used for political reasons only.
The country hit an all time record of26,000 reports in the month of March 2020, though theWomen’s Stats Projectestimates that the already high rate of of violence against women is grossly underreported, suggesting that the real number could be much, much higher. As is seen in the above map, femicides span across the country, affecting nearly every community.
After talking to two young Mexican women, Nicole and Erika, it became clear that through all areas of Mexico are impacted by violence against women, there are still distinct socio-economic factors to consider. Both residing in Mexico City, they expressed their initial hesitancy, but ultimate change of mind, in supporting the feminist movement in Mexico. These two interviews, though unique, provided many similar observations.
Both women grew up in relatively safe, wealthy areas, and have still felt unsafe nearly every time they leave their homes. Nicole noted that her parents would not let her out of the house alone until the age of 18. Both Nicole and Erika described many instances of catcalling, harassment, and generally feeling unsafe in public spaces. Both noted that these feelings went away when they were in the presence of a man, like their father or boyfriend.
While they felt that violent crimes, like rape, were less likely to happen in the areas that they live in, Nicole described an experience which took place at her own, private high school. After a girl at her school was raped by a fellow student, she filed a formal complaint which went through the Principal, HR Board, and a Disciplinary Committee in the presence of both sets of parents (that of the perpetrator and that of the victim). The maximum sentence for the perpetrator was being suspended from school for one day. As Nicole noted, this process, meant to protect students, ultimately does nothing but further hurt the victim.
Both Nicole and Erika expressed that they had previously not cared about and actively distanced themselves from the feminist movement. Terms like ‘femi-nazi’ were commonly used to describe feminists and many aspects of their culture made them feel as though the things happening to women were normal. For example, Nicole recalled watching porn at school in the second grade as her primary experience with sex-education, while Erika noted that nearly every man she knows, including her father and brother, have group chats with other men where pornographic images are shared between them.
Both women attributed the rate of femicide at least partially to the culture of machismo. Nicole noted that there is a disturbing frequency of incestual rape between older male family figures and underage female members. Erika brought up that she used to believe that only “bad girls” got raped and, as is commonly perpetrated in a patriarchal society, the women who were raped were somehow “asking for it”, though she has since changed her mind on this. Now they feel that it is slowly, but surely, becoming easier to openly discuss the problems women face, especially as more and more women come forward and they each realize how much closer these problems are to home than they previously imagined.
Erika noted that since joining the movement, people have accused her of only supporting feminism because it’s trendy, but she feels like her eyes have been opened recently to everything going on around her regarding women’s rights. When asked about men’s places in the movement, both women noted that getting men involved is crucial to implementing change, but that some facets of the feminist movement haveactively excluded men from participating. In order for machismo to change, they expressed, men have to support feminism and actively fight against historic gender norms.
Finally, both girls noted that the degree of corruption in the country is obvious. Both noted that everything begins and ends with education. While Nicole detailed how the public school system ultimately fails to properly educate people, even in very basic levels of math and science, Erika focused on the fact that no one is informed because no one trusts the media due to its close ties to and vast funding from the government, which she witnessed first-hand while working with a media company.
Neither Nicole nor Erika felt that change could come from a top-down government approach. In fact, Nicole noted that it was not an issue of legislation, as Mexico has extensive femicide legislation in place, but rather an issue of a functioning system and a cultural shift. Both agreed that changes start in the home, with men helping out and women taking on more prominent roles in society.
In terms of government response, there is not likely to be any sort of change until new leadership is put in place. Despite appointing women to prominent positions, President Obrador has empowered men like Felix Salgado who openly describes himself as“a womanizer, a partygoer, a gambler, a drunkard”who has been accused of violent rape cases by multiple women, but who has silenced them with his power and influence. The latest in the long line of politicians who have been accused of rape to no avail in Mexico, Salgado was appointed by Obrador to run for governor in Guerrero but was recently dropped from the ballot, not for his rape accusals, but for not properlyreporting campaign finances.In other words, while he may be off the ballot, it is certainly not a victory for the feminist movement.
That said, the recent growth of the movement and increased international attention have the potential to influence change. Ultimately, many cultural norms will need to shift, starting at home and extending all the way to the government. Finally, though the Mexican case is severe, women globally, even in “physically secure” countries for women, are all still very much fighting for their rights and that solidarity that extends beyond borders can help build empathy, community, and, ultimately, the change that all feminists want to see.","May 20, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/ni-una-mas-creating-an-inclusive-impactful-feminist-movement-in-mexico/,Arianna Babraj,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"[ANALYSIS] Klarna: Tax Evasion, Economic Growth and Climate Change","written in partnership with Joshua M. Devine, Nicholas Morgana, Mattia Angelino and Jacopo Ceravolo fromStarting Finance Club Pisa
KlarnaBank ABis aSwedish bankfounded in 2005 in Stockholm. The idea was first introduced during an entrepreneurship contest by Sebastian Siemiatkowski (the current CEO), Niklas Adalberth, and Victor Jacobsson: three students from the Stockholm School of Economics. Despite a harsh appraisal that placed Klarna last in the competition, angel investor Jane Walerud, confident of Klarna’s potential, introduced the three students to a team of programmers who helped them build the platform.
Klarna’s main goal is tosimplify online payments, providing customers with the ability tobuy now and pay later, a much-appreciated approach in Northern Europe. By allowing Klarna’s users to buy a product from an affiliated online retailer and perform the payment up to 30 days after the purchase, they represent, as they put it, “a healthier, simpler, and smarter alternative to credit cards”. This unique service quickly brought a twinkle to investors’ eyes. In 2007, venture capital firm Investment AB Öresund entered the company and just three years later, Sequoia Capital followed up. In that same year (2010), Klarna increased its revenue by over 80%, providing financial services in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands.
In 2011, a $155 millioninvestmentallowed Klarna to expand their service provisioning Austria and supporting the merging with SOFORT AG. Later in 2019, a secondinvestment, amounting to $460 million, empowered the company to spread across the US. This led to a company evaluation of $5.5 billion, making it one of Sweden’s “five unicorns” (startup companies that had succeeded in growing internationally) along with Skype, Spotify, Mojang, and King. A more recent evaluation places the company at an outstanding $10.6 billion value, thus ranking Klarna as the first startup in Europe for capitalization, and fourth in the world.
Klarna’s primary revenue source comes from the percentage paid by shopkeepers, just like their competitors. However, Klarna’s competitive advantage relies on itssimple and “smooth” payment process,requiring minimal information from customers, and thus allowing more frequent and consistent purchases. Businesses who rely on Klarna have seen a 55% increase in the number of online orders, a 44% increase in check-out conversions, and an astonishing +85% in the number of sales.
Another important stream of revenue for the company is itslate payment policy.Klarna allows customers up to 30 days to finalize the payment, which may be divided into three separate installments. At the end of the 30 days period, the platform notifies the customer of their non-payment. After two more notifications, Klarna proceeds in requesting a fee proportional to the customers’ purchases.
The slogan of Klarna is“Buy now, pay later”. In fact, the company grew up like a provider of deferred payments and retail stores. However, after buying a Swedish Banking License, it pivoted its business from a B2B to a B2C model.
The Sweden-based company showed preference focusing on consumers to improve and simplify the purchase experience. This led to Klarna’s conversion into traditional services like credit cards and deposit accounts.
Klarna is theleader of its sector, and it is destined to retain the title for many years. It takes competitive advantages from its capitalization and the support of some famous investors, like Snoop Dog, as well as other historic investors such as Sequoia Capital, Dragoneer, Permira, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Bestseller Group, and Ant Group.
On September 15th, 2020, Klarna raised 650 million dollars, adding new important lenders like Silver Lake, and various funds managed by Blackrock and HMI Capital. The company will leverage the capital increase to continue expanding beyond Europe and the US, aiming to replace the traditional credit card system. As a matter of fact, its services are cheaper than the average credit card. Klarna does not apply interest on repayments, and it allows users to either ratify or pay in one solution, profiting off of those who are insolvent after 14 days.
As stated on their website: “The uniqueness of Klarna’s offer – providing a healthier, simpler, and smarter alternative to credit cards and a broad range of services to enable a superior shopping journey – continues to drive rapid consumer adoption and loyalty with more than 90 million consumers worldwide”.
Another competitive advantage, used to increase market share, is the flexibility of payments, which allows for increasing partners’ sales. It was observed that vendors that accept payments in four installments saw growth in inventory turnover. This is a sign that customers are incentivized to shop more frequently.
Said advantage allowed Klarna to grow together with its main partners, including companies such as H&M, IKEA, Nike, AliExpress, Sephora, Zara, and many more.
Paypalfigures among Klarna’s main competitors. Yet, the first only focuses on final consumers, to the detriment of the merchants. Furthermore, the Swedish unicorn allows its customers to pay once they’ve received their purchases, generating a sense of trust and ease. The list of competitors continues withAffirm, another fintech unicorn with an impressive evaluation of almost 20 billion USD, run by former co-founder of PayPal, Max Levchin.
Last but not least figuresAfterpay, Klarna’s closest competitor. It is an Australian company with high growth potential. The Australia-based company is planning to file a Merger and Acquisition (M&A) with Pagantis – the Spanish gateway for its European expansion plan – with the aim of limiting Klarna’s market share.
Klarna recentlyreported12 million new active users every month, and an average of 55k downloads per day. These data are about three times higher than its closest competitors.
The company recently acquired Moneymour, one of the most promising fintech startups, enriching its know-how and importing Moneymour’s IP and best practices. This acquisition also marks the first step of Klarna’s development center launch in Milan. Klarna is also trying to establish partnerships with other electronic payment companies, like Gimme5, to simplify the management of saving and investment. The partnership with Eurofactor, instead, serves the digitalization of the credit recovery process in Italy. The keyword of the company is clear: “simplify”.
As explained thoroughly above, Klarna has had a positive impact on the life of its users, giving a whole new meaning to payments. However, an analysis of the meaning of such innovations on a European political-economic scale is required. Pros and cons coexist.
Tax evasion represents a significant burden both on the European and domestic economies. In the case of theEU, it adds up to $825 billion. Italy, Germany, and France – the three biggest economiessince the UK left the EU– are on the tax evasion podium. They count respectively 190.9, 125.1, and 117.9 billion Euros lost due to tax evasion (according to 2015 figures).
Digitalization can prevent such a rate of evasion, as shown by theIMF’s 2020 study, carried by Kitsios, Jalles, and Verdier.  According to the study:
“halving the distance to the digitalization frontier couldraise the median VAT revenueby 1.1% of GDP for low-income developing countries, 0.7% of GDP for emerging market economies and advanced economies, and 0.4 percent for the EU.”
However, digitalization itself can offer new fraud opportunities, if economic actors take advantage of new technology to hide sensitive information. Governments are today called to address their institutional and administrative future capabilities to both control digitalization, and to take advantage of it by including it in their own taxation system. Therefore, services such as Klarna offer insights for future governmental and institutional digitalization.
Klarna, in collaboration with several cosmetic, technologic, and clothing brands, offers the possibility to pay for products in installments. Given the global economic recession due toCovid-19, this mode of payment can be beneficial inboostingconsumptionand, therefore, the economy.
However, speaking about raising our consumer impact in 2021 is quite hazardous. Political economists speak clearly when they suggest that, without a planned ‘degrowth’ in consumers’ impact, we will not be able to save our planet fromclimate change.
Economists have different points of view on the impact of consumption on the economy, and its effects on the environment. In orthodox economic theories, consumption has a direct, positive impact on GDP. Economic growth is one of the main indicators of a state’s wealth and it is thus advisable to enact policies that help increase GDP.
On the other hand, proponents of the degrowth theory maintain thateconomic growth leads to an increase in the use of energy. This prevents us from remaining within the 1.5 degrees global average temperature. Keeping this in mind, Klarna might contribute to climate change. It strengthens consumerism, giving people the chance to pay in installments for products that they might not have bought otherwise.
As much as it would represent a step forward in the modernization of European financial infrastructure, on a bigger political-economic scale, promoting consumerism might not be for the greater good.
Furthermore, and quite importantly,Klarnacollaborates with brands such asSephora, which is known to not be a cruelty-free brand. In the case of Klarna Italy, the service is in collaboration with multinational Diesel. The latter brand is known to benon-eco-friendly, with very low labor standards, and no evidence of an animal welfare policy.Championis another brand buyable on Klarna, that:
“has set an absolute target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations but it has not set a supply chain target. There is no evidence it has taken meaningful action to reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals. Moreover, its labor rating is ‘not good enough’. Some of its supply chains are certified by FLA Workplace Code of Conduct in the final stage of production. It received a score of 31-40% in the Fashion Transparency Index.“
All of the above are examples of brands that do not address the urgency of the climate crisis by engaging in ethical behavior towards our planet, animals, or its human laborers.
On a final note, even if they have offered payments in installments an effective way of stimulating economic growth during these times of crisis, huge corporations themselves, such as the ones listed above, have not registered a significant recession during the past year and a half.Addressing the need of boosting medium and small-scale businesses’ growth would be a more ethical way to embrace positive innovations, such as digital payments.","May 25, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/klarna-tax-evasion-economic-growth-climate-change/,Filippo Angeli,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Exacerbation of violence in Sheikh Jarrah,"Recently, Sheikh Jarrah, a predominantly Arabic neighborhood in East Jerusalem, has experienced an exacerbation of violence due to Israeli evictions. The neighborhood was raided by Israeli forces, with 87 Palestinians from 18 families being forcibly evicted from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, sparking yet another wave of violence against Palestinian residents.
The decision to deport Palestinian families in favor ofIsraeli settlerswas made by an Israeli district court, andyet another seven families have been ordered to evict their houses in the area by August 1.The residents in Jerusalem confirmed hearing air raids, sirens, and blasts shortly after 6 p.m. local time when the ultimatum was set to expire. As such,Sheikh Jarrah has become the emblem of the Palestinian struggle against Israel. Anti-eviction protests have taken place in Palestinian cities across the West Bank, as well as by Arab Israelis in Haifa and Nazareth. As a result, over the past two weeks, intending to disperse the protesters, Israeli police have fired a foul-smelling spray known as skunk water.
The communal violence between Israelis and Palestinians has been surging since April (read our report in Italian here), with videos of street vandalism and several attacks between the two communities being posted online. Further,hundreds of far-right Israelis marched down the city shouting “Death to Arabs,”. The tensions between Palestine and Israel have escalated further with the violence that has spread in the Gaza Strip. Militant groups operating from the Gaza Strip have been firing rockets into Israel, with the latter responding by strikes against the coastal territory.The rocket attacks came as a result of an ultimatum released by Hamas,which demanded Israeli security forces’ withdrawal from the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem and the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in the Old City. As a result of the air raids against the Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry,20 Palestinians, including children, have been killed, and hundreds have been injured.
Even the name of the city refers to the personal doctor of the Muslim conqueror Saladin, who is thought to haveconquered the city for Christian crusaders in 1187.After the 1948 War between Israel and the Arabs, and the exodus of a wider population of approximately750,000 Palestinian refugees,some Palestinian families from West Jerusalem and Haifa went to the West Bank, which was then administrated by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The Palestinian families were settled in the area since 1956 when Jordan re-housed them. However, after the 1967 War between Israel and the Arab armies, the West Bank was captured by Israel, which remains occupied today.
Since then, several successful lawsuits were filed to expel the Palestinians from the area by Israeli settler organizations. For instance, 43 Palestinians were evicted in 2002 from Jerusalem, while their homes were taken by Israeli settlers. The al-Kurd family was also removed in 2008, the Hanoun and Ghawi families were evicted in 2009, and the Shamasneh family was evicted in 2017.Accordingly, by using settler organizations, Israel’s leadership has downplayed any state involvement by describing the conflict as a private real estate dispute without any political rationale behind it. Further, under Israeli law, Israelis who can assert a title from before the 1948 fighting that followed Israel’s establishment can reclaim their properties in Jerusalem. However, no such law exists for Palestinians that were also displaced in the same period due to the war.
It becomes evident that the evictions from the area are a part of Israel’s settlement strategy, known asHoly Basin. The latter concerns the geographical region covering and containing Jerusalem’s ancient Old City; the basin and its walled enclosure together form the bulk of the city’s holy sites for Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. As part of the settlement strategy, the plan required theabolishment of the Palestinian houses from the area. Additionally, the Holy Basin has seen unprecedented excavations in recent years, accompanied by major spending totransform antiquity sites into tourist destinations and establish new Jewish worship sites.These excavations are remaking the historic city, erasing non-Jewish elements, while emphasizing Jewish ones, especially during the First and Second Temple periods.
With the absence of a reaction from the international community, the violence will continue to escalate. Specifically, the spokesman forEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saidthat “the significant upsurge in violence in the West Bank, in and near Gaza and in east Jerusalem needs to stop immediately”. The EU may have intensified its call for all sides to refrain from violence but lacks the political will to further engage in finding a solution. Moreover, the United Nations Security Council held emergency consultations on the worsening violence in east Jerusalem and was considering a draught resolution calling on Israel to stop evictions and to respect for “the historic status quo at the holy sites”.
However, none of these statements are enough to terminate the violence between the two communities.The underlying cause of the recent violence remains unchanged: for decades, the gaping wound of the unresolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians remains, a sword of Damocles hanging over them today. As such, despite the best of intentions, for an agreement to be reached, both parties, Israelis, and Palestinians, must be willing to compromise on several issues. In conflict resolution and negotiation, the notion of ripeness, which refers to the timing of the resolution, is the key to any possible viable agreement between the opponents.
Apart from the right to self-determination granted for the Palestinians, with a percentage of more than 20 percent being Arab and identifying themselves as Palestinians and witha natural reproduction rate that is double that of the Jewish population,Israel will have eventually to compromise to a political solution that is acceptable to them. Such a solution will be either accepting the two-state solution or adapting to the one-state reality. If the expansion of settlements continues, an eventual one-state solution will be the outcome, with Israel facing a fight for equal voting rights for Arabs akin to that of South Africa.
Until then, to minimize the violence between Israelis and Palestinians,the international community has been called to engage in minimizing the violence by introducing a monitoring mechanismto be used when one of the parties fails to follow up with their promises and ensure that both sides are held accountable. Both parties, Israeli security forces and militant groups, should exercise maximum restraint and calibrate their use of force.","June 15, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/israeli-palestinian-conflict-exacerbation-of-violence-in-sheikh-jarrah/,The New Global Order,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
India: Between the Farmers’ Struggle and the COVID Crisis,"Between ongoing farmers’ protests and an escalating COVID crisis, India has faced intense challenges in the past year.Farmers’ proteststhat began in September 2020 have remained restless as the nationwide movement continues to demand the repeal of three agricultural bills: The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Act, The Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and The Essential Commodities Act. These bills have been criticized for favoring big business in the farming industry at the expense of smaller farmers across the country. The demands have thus far been rejected, and the protests have been tainted by government repression as well as an overarching theme of working-class struggle.
The social and economic challenges brought forward by the farming bills and ensuing protests have been exacerbated by the country’s COVID crisis. Following a boom in April and May, India has recorded29 million cases and over 380,000 deathsso far. India’s struggle with COVID has been defined by its lack of available supplies, most importantly, oxygen. The situation has forced some patients to turn to the black market, where the cost of oxygen cylinders is significantly higher. India also faced a shortage of vaccines during the peak months of the outbreak. Despite being one of the world’s top producers of the vaccine, it has exported most of its available doses. This is not only a national public health crisis but also highlights the issue of global health inequality: a country of middle/lower income status is not sufficiently resourced to deal with a pandemic.
All-in-all, India has faced great social and economic strain in the past year, amounting to political challenges where the government’s adequacy and capabilities are also questioned.
India’s government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has undergone close scrutiny amid the current challenges. On top of internal civilian distress, the cabinet has faced international criticism for its response to the farmers’ protests and speculation over its delayed response to immediate COVID challenges. This has placed the government under a microscope in which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leadership, and perceived ability to respond to the population’s needs, have been re-evaluated.
Government officials have become increasingly scrutinized for their hesitancy to impose a full-scale national lockdown, the lack of nationwide testing, and a lag in delivering crucial supplies to hospitals amid the second wave of COVID in India. This boiled down to concerns over the economic repercussions of such measures. In some instances, scrutiny of the BJP has resulted inlost state elections, as well as sanctions against officials by the Delhi High Court. Recently,speculation has arisen over the government’s PM Cares charity, which has centered its disaster-relief efforts on COVID support. The charity’s funding from various wealthy donors has reportedly been put towards health care supplies, particularly oxygen ventilators. However, there have been mass complaints that the ventilators were faulty, which has contributed to speculation over the charity’s actual spending and raising concerns over corruption.
Paired with the government’s response to ongoing farmers’ protests, the COVID speculation exacerbates doubts regarding Modi’s service to the people. Protesting farmers have sustained their demand that the government repeal the agricultural bills. At first, talks were initiated to mediate between India’s ruling body and representatives of the country’s farmers. However, these talks have since stalled. Aletter penned by the umbrella organization Samyukta Kisan Morchadescribes Modi’s Government as “the most anti-farmer government that this country has seen”, encapsulating the movement’s cause to raise awareness of the neglect that thousands of farmers feel at the hands of their government. This has reflected the neglect currently felt within the country as much of the population suffers at the hands of what is regarded as COVID mismanagement.
A major contributing factor to the Indian government’s pace of response to the COVID boom in the country, however, is its shortage of resources. Much of the population has been unable to access vaccines, along with medical supplies and facilities to cope with the virus. The existence ofglobal pre-purchase agreementsfor COVID-19 vaccine doses has caused India to fall behind in a race for COVID recovery. That being said, recent weeks have seen reinvigorated efforts to vaccinate every adult in the country.Prime Minister Modi’s announcement of a new policythat makes the federal government responsible for buying the majority of vaccines produced in the country has made the whole population’s recovery more promising. Nevertheless,complications caused by logistics and persuading people to take the vaccine, especially in rural areas, are still delaying recuperation in the country.
Additionally, international aid must be taken into consideration. India’s recovery efforts have been primarily enabled throughforeign actors’ provision of medical aid and supplies. This is added to worldwide fundraising initiatives by independent organizations intended to help Indians in need. In a moment when the government is responsible for spearheading the population’s recovery, it is apparent that it needs external assistance. These international efforts merely echo the global input on India’s farmers’ protests. In particular, Western leaders spoke about the movement, largely in favor of the cause, while independent organizations also rallied together and raised money for protesting farmers. Both cases suggest that it is specifically India’s citizens who rely on international help, as the government cannot entirely provide it.
The Indian government is therefore in a weakened position in terms of its footing as a government trusted to act on the needs of its people. Whether its approaches have been deliberate or a consequence of external circumstances, the government is currently being re-evaluated. Upcoming state elections will continue to be the most accurate reflection of this re-evaluation.

[ANALYSIS] Playing with the Fire of Democracy: Ukraine’s Choice of National Security over Media Pluralism,"The presidential decreewhich unplugged three pro-Russian TV channels overnight on 2 February 2021 was hailed by pro-Western Ukrainians as the first bold move byUkrainePresidentVolodymir Zelenskyto counter Russian propaganda. But, wasn’t it a bold move towards theEuropean Uniontoo? Well,according to a statementby High Representative Josep Borrell, it was indeed, since “the fight against disinformation should not come at the expense of freedom of media”.
Admittedly,freedom of speechis solemnly included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 11, and with Ukraine being the closest partner of the European Neighbourhood Policy since 2014, Zelensky’s crackdown on media pluralism raises some concerns. However, all international conventions protecting freedom of speech establish a few motives based on which a state can restrict such freedom. One of the most popular ones is a pressing, though, historically abused necessity:national security.
It is precisely in the name of national security that the President of Ukraine enacted the National Security and Defence Council decision to impose sanctions on TV channels112 Ukraine, NewsOne,andZIK,accused of spreading disinformation supporting the Russian narrative about the internationally condemned annexation of Crimea by Moscow in 2014 and the ongoing war in Donbas.
These channels hada quite large viewershipin Ukraine and were owned by MP Taras Kozak, from theOpposition Platform – For Life Faction. The leader of the party – representing the second-largest faction in the Parliament after Zelesnky’sServant of the People– is MPViktor Medvedchuk.
Medvedchuck is a pro-Russian oligarch who is believed to be the true owner of the three media outlets, and who wasput under house arreston May 13 with the accusation of treason and attempted theft of government property in Crimea.
The measures affecting the trio include the prohibition of using radio frequencies in Ukraine, a freeze of the broadcasters’ assets, and a ban on financial operations within the country.What exactly did the journalists say to trigger such drastic measures?
The anchors working for the three TV channels which have recently beenblocked on youtubetoo, often called the Ukrainian government’s conflict with Russia-backed separatists in the southeastern region of Donbas a “civil war” instead of an international conflict against Russia, said that Crimea’s population overwhelmingly supported their peninsula’s annexation by Moscow in 2014, and called for the restoration of peace and trade with Moscow.
Inthis excerptof a talk show hosted by TV channel ZIK and included in ajoint statementofUkrainian NGOs countering disinformationin support of Zelensky’s decision, the speaker says in Russian that back in 2014 Russia did not commit an act of aggression against Ukraine, but undertook a defensive operation instead, on the part of the Russian-speaking population of Crimea who risked being subject to “mass killings” as the ones that happened in Independence Square.
In order to understand the meaning of such statements and why they were deemed to pose an actual threat to the national security of Ukraine, it is necessary to briefly describe the relations between Ukraine and Russia over the last few years.
The so-called “Ukrainian crisis” began back in November 2013 when a wave of protests known asEuromaidanflooded Independence Square in Kyiv, demanding the resignation ofpro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovichafter his about-face on longstanding plans to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union.
The Yanukovich government was widely believed to be a conduit for the corrupt power system tying Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and its plan to pursue closer ties with the Russian-led Customs Union (today’s Eurasian Economic Union) further exacerbated the discontent of pro-European protesters.
Tensions reached a peak in February 2014, when several people were shot dead (the above-mentioned “mass killings”).
Yanukovich was accusedof having ordered the shootings and on February 22 he fled the country, leading the Ukrainian Parliament to approve the impeachment against him and to form a newad interimgovernment with Oleksandr Turcynov as its Prime Minister.
The new government discussed, but never approved,a law proposal withdrawing the official language status of Russian, whose speakers represent the majority of the population residing in Crimea and the south-eastern region of Donbas.
With the pretext of protecting the Russian-speaking population of Crimea from a discriminatory Ukrainian government and based on aninvitationfrom ousted President Viktor Yanukovich,Russia undertook a military intervention in Crimea on March 1, 2014, and supported the organization of a referendum which, following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence of Crimea on March 11, asked the Crimean population whether they wanted the peninsula to join the territory of the Russian Federation.
The majority of votes cast in theOSCE disapprovedpoll marked the victory of “yes” andCrimea has thus beende factoannexed to the Russian Federation since March 18, 2014, an event that was widely condemned by the international community triggering the imposition of several sanctions against Russia that are still in force today.
Threats to Ukrainian territorial integrity did not end there, and during the same period, groups of armed men seized industrial enterprises as well as municipal buildings in the Region of Donbas, launching a pro-Russian uprising meant to oppose theEuromaidanmovement in the wake of a longstanding discontent stemming from a feeling of isolation shared by the Donbas residents, mainly old workers ofa once flourishing Soviet industry.
On 11 May 2014,the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk proclaimed their independencefrom Ukraine, creating the so-calledDonetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.
The eastern uprisings thus triggered the war of Donbas that could be defined as a civil war between the central government of Ukraine and the separatist forces, if it wasn’t for the involvement of a foreign country.
President Putin has always denied the involvement of Russian military forces in the Donbas war on the side of the rebels, thus signing the 2015 Package of Measures for the implementation of theMinsk Agreementsas a “third party” mediating between Ukraine and the self-proclaimed Republics, along with France and Germany.
Nevertheless, beyond the early accusations of several third states, the Prosecutor ofthe International Criminal Court issued a reportin 2016 recognizing that Crimea was occupied by Russia and that Russia was militarily involved in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
Several factors like the ambiguity of the position assumed by Russia led to the failure of the Minks agreements and the war in Donbas is still ongoing nowadays, with the parties to the conflict regularly accusing each other of violating the cease-fire.
To date, the war in Donbas has caused over14,000 deaths.
In the light of the above, qualifying the war in Donbas as a typical civil war is not accurate and it clearly supports the Russian narrative aimed at diminishing the degree of its involvement in the conflict.
As for the statement about the “mass killings” supposedly threatening the Russian-speaking population of Crimea, the ZIK channel guest was referring to the above-mentioned shootings that killed about 100 people in Independence Square of which then-President Yanukovich had been accused.
Yanukovich accused Ukrainianfar-right forcesof seeking to frame him, a vision supported by Russia.
According to aleaked conversation between the Estonian foreign minister and EU HP Cathy Ashton– which was laterretracted by the Estonian government-the same snipers seem to have targeted both protesters and policemen, raising questions about why snipers should be responding to the Yanukovich government and target their own colleagues.
However, according to international law, such unproved suspicions do not constitute an actual threat to the Russian-speaking population of Crimea.
Furthermore, the above-mentioned discriminatory law withdrawing the official status of the Russian language was never approved by the Ukrainian Parliament and Russia could have protected the rights of the Crimean population by engaging in a peaceful dialogue with Ukraine, instead of resorting to the use of force, an option that the Charter of the United Nations restricts to extremely limited circumstances.
Thus, Russian military intervention in Crimea is to be considered unlawful, and saying otherwise could be considered as spreading disinformation in the context of an undeclared war, something that could pose a threat to the national security of Ukraine.
They were indeed according to the US, whose embassy in Kyiv tweeted: “The US supports Ukraine’s efforts yesterday to counter Russia’s malign influence, in line with Ukrainian law, in defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity . . .”
Yet, despite the weight of US support, it appears that more voices rose against Zelesnky’s move.
Apart from the above-mentioned concerns raised by Europe,journalists had fewer doubts when condemning the banof the three TV channels, both in Ukraine and abroad.
The National Union of Journalists of Ukraineand theIndependent Media Trade Union of Ukraineexpressed their disapproval of the government decision, calling it an attack on freedom of speech and democracy.
The General Secretary of theInternational Federation of Journalists, Anthony Bellanger, said, “This arbitrary and politically-motivated ban is unacceptable in a democracy. The ban puts at risk the job of hundreds of media workers who have nothing to do with their media owners’ political affiliations.”
The General Secretary of theEuropean Federation of Journalists, Ricardo Gutiérrez, stated, “Banning broadcasts is one of the most extreme forms of restricting media freedom. These bans should only be applied in very exceptional circumstances […] It seems clear that the presidential ban is not at all in line with international legal standards on Freedom of Expression and the broadcasting media”.
What are the international legal standards when it comes to government restrictions of freedom of expression?
As a member of the Council of Europe, Ukraine signed the European Convention on human rights, whose guardian institution is the European Court of Human Rights.
The Court has repeatedly stated thatfreedom of expression “constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society”and when assessing a State’s interference with the freedom of expression, it uses thethree-part test.
Three cumulative conditions are to be fulfilled for domestic authorities to legitimately interfere with the freedom of expression:
As for the first part of the test, the Ukrainian government decree banning the three TV channels uses provisions in Article 4 of Ukraine’ssanctionslaw for economic sanctions in cases of “participation in terrorism”.
Nevertheless, in theLeander v. Swedenjudgment, the Court said that the wording of the law must be sufficiently clear as to give individuals an adequate indication of the legal conduct and the consequences of acting unlawfully.
Considering that an internationally recognized definition of “terrorism” is still lacking, the consequentvague characterof the concept makes it doubtful as to whether the Ukrainian government’s decree will pass the first part of the test.
Regarding the second part, national security is the official motive given by President Zelensy as a justification for the decision. Looking at the separatist regions of Donbas, territorial integrity could also be an interest that the Ukrainian government intends to protect.
However, interests such as national security were seen as overriding the interest of protecting freedom of expression in cases where the expression sanctioned by the domestic authorities was aimed at the destruction of the rights outlined in the Convention.
Particularly, inSener v Turkey, the Court held thatincitement to violence against the Stateanddissemination of hate speechis to be considered the only circumstances enabling a Contracting State to restrict the right of the public to be informed about a different perspective on a given issue – in that case, the separatist political agenda of the PKK – “irrespective of how unpalatable that perspective might be for the State” (inSurek and Ozdemir v. Turkey).
The pro-Russian narrative conveyed by the three banned TV channels is certainly questionable, especially considering the international consensus around Russian breaches of international law at the expense of Ukraine.
Nevertheless, the unplugged trio was not accused of conveying statements inciting violence or disseminating hate speech, unless the Ukrainian government will do so in the future.
To conclude, in light of the above, it is doubtful that the banning of three pro-Russian TV channels constitutes a “pressing social need”.
Nevertheless, there is one essential difference between the Kurdish separatist propaganda in Turkey and the pro-Kremlin propaganda in Ukraine: the military presence of a foreign State, Russia, on the territory of Ukraine, with the former accused by the latter of using a means of hybrid warfare.
That is why, despite hardly meeting the three requirements established by the European Court of Human Rights, it is also true that the present issue can hardly fit in the court case law.
With the presidential decreehaving been contested in court, it will be interesting to learn the details of the Ukrainian government position and to see if the case will attain the European Court of Human Rights.","June 05, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-playing-with-the-fire-of-democracy-ukraines-choice-of-national-security-over-media-pluralism/,Greta Di Mattia,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"[ANALYSIS] Elon Musk, Bitcoin, and China: Is This the End?","A past article published on The New Global Order underlined howpolitical events are not immune to financial speculation. In this sense, Elon Musk has been playing with fire. For example, he’s a renowned supporter ofDogecoin, a “satirical” cryptocurrency. In the past few months, his tweets in support of the coin have inflated its price up to+800% in one day.
And yet, Musk himself most recently sent the price of Dogecoin down a slippery slope. The reason? During an appearance onSaturday Night Live, he called Dogecoin “a hustle”. Before the episode ended,the coin had lost 29,5% of its value.It is safe to say that Elon Musk knew one thing or two about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.
On May 13th, with one of his laconic tweets, Elon Musk announced thatTesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin. According to the flamboyant entrepreneur, the decision was based on environmental concerns tied to Bitcoin mining. Theprice of the assetwent down from an all-time high of $60k on May 10th to about $42k on May 16th.
But the misfortunes of the flag-bearer of cryptocurrencies did not end. On May 18th,China banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing crypto-related services. The ban covers account openings, registration, trading, clearing, settlement, and insurance. Furthermore, Chinese banking institutions cannot issue crypto-related financial products.
On May 17th, Bitcoin touched a low value of$30,202 per coin, the lowest since January 2021. In the span of one week,the entire market of cryptocurrencies lost $1 trillionin value.An amount of wealth the equivalent of 1.5 “Next Generation EU”‘s was dissipated.
Amidst the ensuing chaos, Elon Musktweeteda “diamond hands” emoji. Apparently, that was his way of signaling that Bitcoin was worth holding onto. But the panic was already spreading, and on May 19th the Google searches for “Should I sell my crypto” were up 400% from the day before. From May 9th to May 28th,Bitcoin had lost 47.3% of its value. Institutional and amateur investors alike recurred to sell-off, leading to further losses.
It is legitimate to ask whether amateur investors should have done their homework. Yes, they definitely should have. Any professional trader would tell prospective investors to do their research on the assets they are interested in. At the same time, arguably,with big capital come big audiences, and consequently big responsibilities.
The peculiarity of this series of events is precisely thatit did not remain confined to a small number of insiders. In fact, Bitcoin is increasingly the object of small investor’s attention. Its astonishing growth rates in the past year, and the prospect of easy and fast gains, are undeniably appealing. All in all,the public’s trust in Bitcoin was on the rise in 2020. So much so thatFinancial Times’ Frances Coppola wrote that Bitcoin could be aninteresting choice as the world’s reserve currency. Therefore, the sudden drop in its value was a bolt from the blue to many.
To understand what brought about the “May 2021 Crypto Crash”, it is necessary to take a step back. Only by looking at things from a distance, in fact, it is possible to reconstruct the bigger picture. Under this light, Musk’s U-turn, the Chinese ban on crypto, environmental concerns and financial turmoil look like pieces of the same puzzle.
Different people describe Elon Musk in different ways. To someone, he’s a role model and the epitome of a successful businessman. To someone else, he’s a troll. Some people think of him as a genius, others as a fool. At any rate, as someone that can exert a detectable effect on financial markets with a tweet, he is certainly influential.
Certainly, it would be hard to believe that anyone could build an empire such as Musk’s without having some common sense. If this is the case, it is legitimate to wonder whyElon Musk would withdraw his support for Bitcoin. He could have certainly known that this would cause a sharp drop in its price. It would not have been the first time that the financial market would go insane at his whim.
In other words,it is possible that the visionary CEO either envisioned a larger gain to be made in the future, or he evaluated that the momentary loss of a portion of his fortune was somehow the lesser evil. It is not possible for outsiders to know for sure what drove his decision, but it is possible to trace back the most salient aspects of these events and connect the dots.
One issue that deserves better investigation is what prompted Musk’s sudden U-turn with regards to Bitcoin. In his statement, Musk cites environmental concerns, tied to the use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining. As a matter of fact, these concerns are not baseless. In a year,Bitcoin uses up as much energy as Polandhowever, not all of this energy comes from fossil fuels. Plus, it is very hard to ascertain the mix of renewable and non-renewable sources in mining factories.
The issue is so controversial that a recentNature Communicationsacademic paperon the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining in China received heavy criticism. Allegedly,the paper failed to clarifyhow the researchers estimated the energy mix for mining machines. In the absence of accurate estimates,the issue of how much Bitcoinshouldconsume is at the mercy of value judgments. For those who think that cryptocurrencies are little more than a scam, no amount of pollution is tolerable.For those who see it as the future of finance, it is worth sacrificing the environment, to an extent.
The point is that, by all means, Musk should belong to the latter category.Thus, his disavowal of Bitcoin seems rather “out of character”. Even more so given that in FebruaryTesla bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoinand started accepting it as payment. Considering the context, it is easy to argue that behind the crash there may be more than meets the eye.
It has been suggested that the resounding announcement of Musk’s estrangement from Bitcoin was nothing more thana smokescreen for Tesla’s losses. Indeed, in the past few months, the company has been sailing in troubled waters.
In March, the USNational Transportation Safety Boardwarnedthat Tesla was using customers to test new driverless technology, or “Full Self Driving”. In April, at theShanghai Auto Show, protesters complained aboutalleged brace malfunctioning.Further concerns tied to Tesla’s storage of customers’ data and the overall safety of its cars put Elon Musk in a difficult spot.
This series of bumps in the road, together with the more specific issues discussed below, point towards the idea that Elon Musk willfully created havoc around Bitcoin. In other words, disowning the currency citing environmental concerns could have been part of a strategy of distraction. The aim of this strategy would have been todivert attention from Tesla’s flaws with just a pinch ofgreenwashing. This is not to say that Musk is not concerned with the environment at all. Rather, it means that other elements likely entered his considerations.
Amidst these difficulties, two emerging challenges appear as particularly worrisome. The first of them is relatively new, but its impact could be substantial. In particular,the number of registered Tesla vehicles in China droppedto11.949units in April, down from34.714units in March (see figure below).
As the Chinese market represents one-fifth of Tesla’s revenue, this is a serious blow for the company. All the more so, as China and Musk’s company started out as the best of buddies. Only two years ago,in 2019, Chinese banks lent Tesla $1.4 billion over a 5-year period.
Despite this idyllic life, Elon Musk’s and China’s interests are very different. For starters, Tesla and the Chinese government have completely different outlooks on cryptocurrencies. So the partnership took place as the former became a champion of crypto, while the latter was cracking down on it.
But the sources of divergence run deeper than that.Tesla established its Shanghai Gigafactory to cut down transportation and manufacturing costs. Also, betting on electric vehicles was functional to China’s goal ofbecoming carbon neutral by 2060. To be sure, that goal remains unchanged. The only difference is that now the country does not feel it has to rely on foreign electric cars.
In fact, the domestic competition in the Chinese market from companies such asNIOis on the rise.The government’s support is self-evident in how the public discourse changed. Xinhua and People’s Daily have joined Tesla’s critics. The popular newspapers often publishopinion piecesstating that Tesla ignores the rights of consumers.Reportedly, even the protests at theShanghai Auto Showwere part of a set-up to discredit the company.
However, even if this process of “decoupling” between Tesla and China were to continue, it would be incremental. In fact, in the first trimester of 2021 Tesla did score a discouraging-18%; but in light of the+745%of 2020,this number looks like a bearable loss. That being said, this is not the only issue that Tesla is confronting.
In fact, the company has encountered serious issues with the supply of semiconductors lately.The “lead time” (the period of time between the order and the delivery) rose to17 weeksin April. Between 10k and 20k vehicles are sitting idly in Tesla’s Freemont plant. These chips, in fact, are a fundamental component in their construction.
This logistical problem also reverberates on the price of Elon Musk’s cars, and thus on their competitiveness. In May,Tesla increased its Model 3 and Model Y prices. This was the fifth increase in just a few months. According to Intel Corp’s CEO,this shortage could last for years.
In this regard, Intel’s$20 billion planto address the issue might alter the geopolitics of chips. The plan, in fact, entails building two factories in Arizona and expanding to other locations in the U.S. and Europe. This suggests that Tesla’s difficulties on the Chinese market, the logistical bottleneck, and the Bitcoin crash are all elements of a larger phenomenon:the US-China “trade war”.
As a matter of fact, it is possible that Musk simply bit off more than he can chew when deciding to invest in China, but two elements emerge as particularly relevant in contradicting this thesis.
The first element is economic in nature. Namely, when an American investor decides to bet on China, he very likely knows the situation on the ground. Ostensibly, he is informed about the treatment of foreign investors, concessions, and limitations.
Taking this into consideration, it is likely that the enigmatic entrepreneur was conscious that the Chinese market was risky. After all, China’s ban on Bitcoin is not the first forceful act of the government on its companies.At the same time, the reward was high: China’s vast internal market is the object of desire of any automotive company. Therefore, the decision to invest there does not appear at all as irrational.
The second element is more political in nature. The fact that Tesla is trapped in a logistical bottleneck is due to the arm-wrestling between the Chinese and US governments. Measures are in place in the US from September 2020,slowing down the import of chips from China. Although these measures are not directed against Tesla, they do affect the company as collateral damage, as seen above.
Currently, the situation is increasingly heating up. In retaliation to the US measures,China regulated more strictly the export of sensitive technologies. In return, the US Senate is discussing the $250 billionU.S. Innovation and Competition Act. The package includes $52 billion in support of the domestic production of semiconductors.
Does this sour competition entail the end of Musk’s empire? Not necessarily. The honeymoon between Tesla and China might well have come to an end, but on the other hand, looking at the series of events that recently took place, it would appear thatthe resourceful entrepreneur is exploiting a window of opportunity.
In fact, the turn of the screw on the Chinese market, combined with the increased efforts by the US government to nationalize the production of semiconductors, might be a chance for Elon Musk to change his strategy. Namely, forpartially abandoning the unequal Chinese market and betting on the American (andIndian) market instead.
At home, Tesla might find the support that China is no more willing to grant. Under this perspective, the decision to repudiate Bitcoin makes even more sense. If Musk had a sense that China’s crackdown was about to come,why not make a preemptive strike, and look like he was in charge of events?
At the end of this analysis, it is only natural to wonder about the future of Bitcoin. According to a popular interpretation,the recent crash might help to “clean up the market”. In particular, two categories of investors appear detrimental to the health of the cryptocurrency market.
The first one is composed ofamateur investors. These are usually small or micro-investors that, individually, would not have the power to throw the market off balance. But, as cryptocurrencies become more popular, more “recreational” investors enter the market. The problem is that, on an aggregated level, these people are buying into Bitcoin just for the thrill of seeing its value go up. In case of a stunt in growth, this kind of investor will most likely sell their shares. This, in turn, contributes to the sell-offen masse.
The second category is composed oftraders taking excessive risk. These investors could be either retail or institutional. What they have in common is their use of “margin”. Essentially, this entailsborrowing from their brokerage firm to take a bigger position in Bitcoin. The issue is that if prices go down traders have to sell their assets to cover their debt. This practice wiped out about 800,000 crypto accounts during the May Crash.
Now, the fact that occasional investors exited the market may lead to increased stability.Experts forecast that Bitcoin might even grow even moreand reach a 6-figure value by the end of the year. However, before giving in to the temptation of “buying low”, two considerations should be taken into account.
Cryptocurrencies appear to be, to some observers, the future of banking. Notably, Bitcoin attracted the interest of the then-Managing Director of the International Monetary FundChristine Lagarde. Based onblockchaintechnology, in fact, cryptocurrencies ostensibly allow decentralized control over the currency. But the Chinese crackdown on Bitcoin should suffice as a reminder thatcentralized banking and financial institutions are not yet ready to retire. On the contrary, with the ban, the Chinese government reasserted its control over the financial market. This is coherent with China’s vision for two reasons.
First, the idea that underpins cryptocurrencies is that money should belong to everyone. This concept, of course, betraysa strong libertarian tendency. But China’s government closely controls and directs the economy, while also participating in important sectors. Hence, the need to assert “who’s in charge” to issue currency.
Secondly,China’s financial policyis designed to serve the real economy and favor stability. In contrast, cryptocurrencies are characterized by volatility. If this was not enough, the price of Bitcoin doubled in the past five months, quadrupled in the past year. This suggested that a bubble was forming. And, as it is well-known, it is hard to predict when bubbles will burst.Arguably, this “suspicious” trend prompted China to reduce its reliance on an asset that would lose its value anyway.
A second relevant element is that, in the absence of fundamentals,cryptocurrencies are tied to trust. Once that trust is compromised, it is very hard to gain back. As stated above, many small investors opted out of crypto during the crisis. Institutional investors are going down the same road,according to JP Morgan strategists.
So far, the value of Bitcoin had been increasing because it was more and more widespread. For example, since April 2021PayPal accepts certain cryptocurrencies as payment. Other retailers,including Xbox and Burger King, were also joining the team of crypto-friendly shops, but as people sell out their crypto, it is hard to fathom whether paying with Bitcoin will still be a viable option in the future.Even if Bitcoin were to scale down, cryptocurrencies are probably here to stay. There is already much talking about different currencies, less reliant on fossil fuels for mining.","June 23, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/elon-musk-bitcoin-and-china/,Shary Mitidieri,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Where Are All the Chinese Villains?,"Experts have propounded that China is on its way to bring back itsbox office revenues to pre-pandemic levels.A rising China also emerged as thebiggestandfastest-growingmovie market on the planet.This has prompted movie producers from the West to actively work to appease authorities as well as advertisers in China. One of the most seminal examples of Hollywood studios’ appeasement towards China in recent years has been the removal ofJapanese and Taiwanese flag patchesfrom Tom Cruise character’s jacket in the sequel toTop Gun. The movie also saw the involvement of Chinese holding Tencent as “an investor and co-marketer“.
However, appeasement to gain access to the Chinese market does not end here.Instead, commentators have observed appeasement of Chinese authorities to be part of a larger pattern that is observable in other industries as well and possesses the potential to impact the great power competition between the US and China. This pattern stands in stark contrast to the rivalry witnessed between the USSR and the US during the Cold War. In fact, movies such asRocky,Rambo III,A Good Day to Die Hard,Telefon, and theLiving Daylightshad Soviet villains to highlight the clear-cut enmity between the US and the USSR.
Notably, there has been a resurgence of stereotypical villains from the former Soviet Union in movies such asSalt, The November Man,Child 44,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spyand with the character ofIrina SpalkoinIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. These portrayals have been a physical manifestation of the threat perceptions of that time. They were communicated through the portrayal of characters in movie roles traditionally considered and rendered “bad guys”.There has been a sharp contrast in the portrayal of Soviet villains as opposed to Chinese villains even as tensions flare between the US and China.
Chinese opposition to any negative depictions has been so fierce that Christopher Nolan’sDark Knightwas not even presented in China due to sanctions on Beijing.The reason was the presence of a shady Chinese businessman, “Lau”, as a fictional character in the movie. The 2012 movieRed Dawnmemorably bartered itsChinese villains for North Koreansin order to gain access to multiplexes in China.
These developments also put a spotlight on the emerging culture of “self-censorship” in Hollywood in regards to China.Denizens have also focused on movies such asAbominable, which has been observed to bolster China’sterritorial claims to the South China Sea. Additionally, Brad Pitt was only allowed to promote his movieAlliedin China after abanextending over 20 years for his movieSeven Years in Tibet, That experience has acted as a warning to tread carefully when selecting thecast, plot, dialogue, and settingsfor Hollywood films.
Traditionally, China has focused onhard powerto achieve its objectives. However, Beijing has gained increasing cognizance of this limit, and has been investing in public diplomacy. The objective is to cultivate and wield soft power, rather than be exclusively dependent on hard power.One of the ways thatZhongnanhaihas succeed in portraying the desired image is through a quota on Hollywood movies that can be released in Chinese theaters.
The system was earlier based on abilateral pactpertaining to movie imports, which has now expired. Beijing has also utilizedimport permits, distribution dates, and digital keysas bargaining chips to censor movie studios. These instruments can result in unaffordable, expensive delays.All movies exported to China must also adhere to the constitution of the country, as well as upholdsocial morality. Strategic analysts are of the opinion that these factors could be exploited asdiplomatic leverageagainst the new President in the White House, as they were against President Trump during the trade war.
Moreover, scholars have emphasized the importance of movies as one of the key drivers of the cultural industry of China.Movies have emerged as markers of excellence and a crucial indication of thesoft power and influence of national culture. The movie industry has likewise been brandished by the Chinese Communist Party for purposes of making the Chinese audience cognizant ofcultural infiltration, the instruction of fifth column agents as well as the nurturing of oppositioninside China, wherein the stated catalyst was the US pivot to Asia.
Consequently, Chinese theaters have been directed to showcase propaganda moviestwice a week, such asBattle of Xiangjiang River(2016) andThe Sacrifice(2020). These propaganda movies are also to be providedpreferentialtreatment, such as special scheduling slots aimed at increasing the “affection” of the youth as well as tohonorthe centenary of the CCP.
Nevertheless, one movie in recent years which featured a villain or antagonist who is aChinese gangsterwasThe Gentlemanin 2019.The movie was inundated with accusations of usage of “casual racial slurs”. Furthermore, an artificially-created dearth of Chinese villains has provided space for the Chinese government to promote movies such as Wolf Warrior, designed to conjure a passion for patriotism and portrays Westerners as villains. Wolf Warrior2has also drawn parallels with old propaganda movies. This becomes extremely significant asmass perceptions of threatcan drastically impact a nation’s foreign policy, including mobilization against the perceived threat.
Moreover, Chinese movies are making headway into foreign markets with one prominent example beingThe Wandering Earth.The movie showcases Chinese aspirations in a Sino-centric global order, through things such as international joint action. The movie has also taken geopolitical considerations into account. For instance, the ally of the Chinese protagonist in the movie is a Russian cosmonaut, which mirrors the contemporary convergences found between Russia and China.
Subsequently, a new strategy is emerging in Chinese cinema, wherein the Hollywood movie structure is combined with a foundation centered on aChinese story and manufactured around global audience orientation.Furthermore, the advent of non-traditional security threats has also contributed to the rise of new villains such aseco-villains. Yet, Russian villains are in the future slated to be portrayed withtotal impunityas Russian interference in US elections is divulged. This factor is also coupled with the limited heft of the Russian market, which appears to be less alluring than the Chinese market to Hollywood denizens. At the same time, Chinese movies seem to be challenging Hollywooddominance, just as China is challenging the US across the globe.

America’s Great Power Conundrum: Competition or Confrontation?,"In 2017, then-President Donald Trump added anarcane termto his National Security Strategy thatshifted US strategic planning towards a path of defensive and contesting diplomatic thinking. In 2018, Trump used the arcane term todefine and describe growing long-term strategic competitionin the USNational Defence Strategyand theNational Military Strategy. The recent interest in great power competition (GPC) comes from these strategic documents. Not to be outdone by his predecessor, US President Joe Biden has referenced the expanding GPC as akey strategic issuein his Interim National Security Strategy.
For international relations scholars and US foreign policy experts, the references serve as an important notice that firmlyestablishes the notion of GPC as the principal outlook in America’s grand strategy. Not since the Cold War has the US diplomatically and strategically dealt with another great power. With that said,the emerging multipolar rules-based order is not similar to the Cold War. Unlike the bipolar order that shaped US-Soviet great power interactions, the current rules-based order is witnessing deepening multipolarity with several significant poles of power. What is more, China is not the Soviet Union.As a great power, China can combine itstraits of power—economic, militaristic, diplomatic, and technological—to mount serious opposition to American primacy.
With such heightened attention and interest in GPC with China, America is in a strategic conundrum in developing a functional and thorough grand strategy thataddresses its national interests with growing competition from an equal power. With many Cold War hawks still having prominent voices in US grand strategy, perhaps America is too hastened in its tilt towards GPC at the cost of great power peace.
Although this buzzword has become central to recent US foreign policy and grand strategy, the concept of GPC is not well defined. In 2018, the RAND Corporationdefined GPCas a“state of antagonistic relations short of direct armed conflict between actors.”Another approach to GPC is todefine the conceptas a“conflict, short of war, between an incumbent power and a rising challenger.”The latter definition echoes the thought process of manyUS hawk strategists and policy expertsas they seeChina’s great power rise and behavior as a direct challenge to American primacyand its championing of the rules-based international order it helped create.
However, these definitions lack coherent conceptual elements of what competition entails. Despite these vague accounts, three conceptual elements transcend every variety of GPC. First, there is aconstant struggle between conflict and coexistence between the great powers in managing and achieving a promptlyfavorable ratioof objective achievements over each other. Second,GPC reflects thegeopolitical environment and structural realitiesof the period it inhabits. Lastly,GPC has specificefficacy on competitive stakesthat contribute to long-term strategic objectives.
It is easy to portray GPC as an all-or-nothing conflict when linked to the events leading up to the First and Second World Wars. However, despite warnings from foreign policy experts and strategists that a more competitive world would bring back chances of great power armed conflict, a distinct and possible outcome,there is a difference betweencompetition and an all-out struggle.In particular, GPC has advantages in generating prosperity through influencing the normative, positional and material perspectives of great powers.
Normatively, GPC can have practical implications in bringing forwarda refined rules-based order that reflects its multipolarity. Such competition does not imply theirrelevanceof the current system’s rules, norms, and values, but instead universalizes the rules-based order to all states, all forms of government, and across all levels of powers—making no one actorabove and beyond the rules-based order or establishing a double standard of behaviour. When the US or its allies in the liberal rules-based order imposed sanctions on strategic rivals or established military bases outside their geopolitical peripheries, it considered such decisions aslegitimate and following the rulesof the liberal order. However, when rivals mirror such actions, the US and its allies accuse such states ofbullying and intimidatingothers, asserting such policies asbelligerent and expansionist.
Materially and positionally,GPC over technological, political, and economic leadership can lead to comprehensive prosperity as it forces great powers to use their assets to resolve spurring threats of the period.Despite the threat of nuclear annihilation during the Cold War, Soviet-US GPC included advancements insmallpox vaccine researchand treaty implementation onnuclear proliferation.
Although this generation of great powers competesover conventional hard power, there is ongoing competition over alternative forms, namely greener and innovative technologies and pharmaceutical public goods.Competition and success over these alternatives provide more significant avenues for influence and leadership at lower cost-to-reward ratios. Moreover, GPC for these areas offers more headway against spurring issues, promoting more global prosperity as great powers thatfall behindon such areas will not want to besingled outfor their inadequacy in dealing with escalating global problems.
The disadvantages of GPC are well documented in history and could help this generation’s great powers to avoid the same pitfalls. However, American GPC is on the edge of making similar strategic errors. The reasoning for such mishandling is due toAmerican hawks and foreign policy circles observing GPC through a diminishing outlook of American hegemony. This perspective puts GPC as afixated notionthat theUS needs to compete with any and every challenger in the rules-based order as failure would be an existential threat to America’s survival.
Great Power Competition as a guiding principle in American grand strategy risks confusing means and ends, and likely to undermine, rather than enhance, US power and influence.
The misgivings of this approach fail to addressthe strategic reasoning for competition and identifying what the US is competing over. Second, it also generates strategic justifications forazero-sum containment stanceagainst any challengers.As a result, this approach observes short-term objectives in the form of conventional military and nuclear numerical superiority and alternative forms of power as key strategic initiatives thatmust be achieved without compromise.The problem that arises from this approach to GPC is that it inevitably leads toreactionary strategies ofunnecessary escalation, security dilemmas, and the misallocationof vital resources that canrisk triggering unforeseen consequences.
An alternative strategy, the US may want to undertake is Great Power Politics (GPP). In scholarly and foreign policy circles, the term conjures images of powerful states using their material power to maximize and pursue wealth, territory, and military influence. It also implies a return ofrealpolitikto grand strategy, thereby increasing the pursuit of security through overarching dynamics of “power” in the rules-based order. However,by updating GPP to reflect the geopolitical realities of the multipolar rules-based order, this approach may provide the US with an optimal grand strategy for achieving its great power interests without unnecessary confrontation.
GPP is a strategy of integrational interests and mutual responsibilities with state-centric fragmentation over desires of influence, power dynamics, and rules.Through this strategy, great powers exhibit how they will pursue their state-centric interests with a shared role in rectifying orderly deficiencies, shortcomings, and threats to global stability and peace.GPP uses a mix of conventional tools of power with modernized instruments of strategic diplomacy to extend networkings that avoid asymmetric trends of power contestation.Lastly, GPP is not primarily concerned with expansion. Instead, it prices high strategic initiative forgreat power engagement that contributes revelatory strategies for great power competition, coexistence, and collaboration.
Daniel Nexonattests that “competition among great powers cannot return, because it never really went away. Rivalries between leading states exist in every international system.” This statement is extremely accurate, especially in the post-Cold War period and now, asthe US and others havejockeyed for power and influencein international relations despite living in the “long peace.”Coming off the Trump presidency that outright declared the return of GPC andChina as an existential threatto American survival, along with his administration’sundervaluing US diplomacyas a key tool,GPP can offer the Biden administration pathways to resolve the worries and interests brought on by more dynamic strategic competition.
By re-engaging America’s grand strategy with the expanding competition from different conditions of power in the multipolar rules-based order,Biden’s strategy of GPP can estimate thevalue of specific objectives at stakewith America’s long-term great power interests.Moreover, GPP offers the US the much-needed recognition of growing competition in areas it long controlled with new significant areas that have consequences to American great power hegemony. Within this context,GPP offers the US a revelatory perspective to strategic competitionas its long-term and is a means to achieve objectives relating toa state’s security, prosperity, and autonomy, and anchors responsibility for sharing global leadership on peace and stability initiatives.
To avoid armed conflict in competition,GPP does not seek to topple another great power for purely antagonistic reasons, thereby removing possible struggles for power that would inevitably force a state toprioritize conflict over coexistence. Instead, it seeks to applypressure to competitively follow the multipolar order’s rules-based structure, makingclear that any breachesinexisting geographical borders, territorial changes, or regime typesthrough coercion or force will result in great power contestation.GPP also uses competition to organizeprinciples of great power management to guide pragmatic policymakers to rejectsudden and unthinkable policiesfrom transpiring.
GPP offers a prominent role fordiplomacy through conventional and unconventional strategic dialoguesfor manageable competition to emerge. In both the Concert of Europe and Cold War periods, strategic dialogues were critical components in managing GPC. By providing such forums for communication, Sino-US great power relations can sustainmanageable andinescapable geopolitical, ideological, and economicdifferences and shared interests that guide their competition.
Strategic dialogues also installconfidence-building measures (CBMs)to avoid accidental escalations.CBMs are ratified within GPP to lower mistrust among great powers.The US should extend CBMs to verifyformally agreed or informally recognizedparameters to reduce mistrustin competition.During the Cold War, CBMs led to the practices of “trust but verify.” Current strategies on CBMs should arrive from China and the US abstaining from cyberattacks thattarget civilian and critical infrastructuretoChina respectingthe freedom of navigation and aircraft movements in the South China Sea, and America reducing its number ofregional naval operations and exerciseswith allies and partners.
In searching for a formula to manage strategic competition, the US must ensure its great power grand strategy holds long-term interactionsthat place principal judgments of competition versus confrontation.Sino-US great power relations will manage the coming decades, and their engagement will inform the rules, norms, and values of the multipolar rules-based order that willsteer peer-nations to coexist and compete in an unruly or ruly world.

Conditions of Prisoners in Bahrain During Covid-19,"The Bahraini government has once again found itself under the critique of many human rights activists. The country, situated in the Persian Gulf, is in the hands of a royal family which is known for its human rights violations, despite its accession to many human rights treaties and engagement with UN treaty bodies. Following a short-lived attempt at democracy, the Sunni al-Khalifa royal family has been incredibly oppressive to its Shia citizens. In spite of this, it has enjoyed international support from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the UK (which has been called its ‘main protector’). The former two were actively involved in dismantling the 2011 rebellion for democracy, and the latter has provided experts to help maintain security in the country to prevent torture and sexual assault of prisoners.
According toAmnesty International, even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, inmates in prisons like Jau prison did not receive even the minimal requirements for healthcare. In 2019, there was an outbreak of scabies, a disease common in cramped and unclean living spaces. Jau prison is the largest prison in Bahrain, holding hundreds of civil rights activists, journalists, and opposition political leaders in small, overcrowded cells. Despite the government releasing 1,500 prisoners as a form of damage control in March 2020, dozens of prisoners are still cramped into cells of just 13.5m2. This overcrowding is just the first of three ways in which treatment of prisoners falls short of theUN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which also designates that prisoners should be given appropriate accommodation and the ability to talk to their families. In response, many Bahraini human rights NGOs, likeSalam for Democracy and Human Rights, called for an immediate release of all political prisoners. The request was denied.
With the spread of COVID-19 across the world, the contagion found in Jau prison has the ideal conditions to spread rapidly through the inhabitants.The first cases of COVID in the prison appeared on March 23,when the Bahraini government confirmed that three prisoners had been diagnosed with COVID-19 symptoms. This was both the first and last official disclosure of the number of sick inmates. The overcrowding has made the implementation of social distancing measures nearly impossible. The families of inmates and human rights activists have listed at least70 prisonersrumored to have COVID-19 symptoms, but recent estimates predict that over100 prisonershave contracted the disease. The true number of infected inmates cannot be certain due to restrictions on sick prisoners reaching out to family members on the outside. In astatement on March 28, the government claimed that sick prisoners were being isolated and given their weekly calls to their families. However,Amnesty Internationalhas disputed this, stating that Bahraini authorities have not been completely honest about the outbreak in Jau prison, adding that denying weekly calls to families causes anxiety.
In response to the spread of COVID-19 within the prison, many prisoners banded together, forming human chains, in a sit-in protest against the lack of supplies given to prisoners to stop the spread of the virus. They were beaten by security forces as a result. Recorded telephone conversations with inmates have revealed that protesting prisoners were brutally beaten with batons by riot police. The official response to these reports has been muddy, with theGeneral Administration of Reform and Rehabilitationstating that security forces had little choice as prisoners blocked corridors and refused to enter their wards over a weeklong period. The National Institution for Human Rights denied the violence entirely.
Prisoners were not given face masks or hand-sanitizer, nor were they tested for COVID-19 regularly.Prisoners were only able to buy hygiene supplies, such as soap, from the prison commissary, but some inmates, such as Sayed Nazir, have been barred from going to the commissary. As a consequence, Nazir has since tested positive for COVID-19. The vaccination situation in the prison has also been unclear. According to the Bahraini government’s statement on March 28, all prisoners that wanted vaccinations received them. However,Amnesty International’s statementin April states that the preventative measures carried out in the prisons have been “woefully inadequate”.
Protests have also taken place outside of the prisons following the ten-year anniversary of the 2011 pro-democracy insurrection. Families have been protesting for better prison conditions and the release of all political prisoners. They have called for the international community to exert political pressure on the royal family. Many peaceful protesters have been arrested, aggravating the problem. Human rights defenders have called for the government to heed the demands of the protesters, and have condemned the conditions in prisons.Al-Wefaq, Salam for Democracy and Human Rights and BIRDhave accused the security forces of using excessive force in dealing with protesters both inside and outside of prisons.

Ukraine’s Latest Near Crisis: Russian Opportunism or a Harbinger of War?,"On April 23, 2021, Russia “withdrew” its forces, which it had built up along its border with Ukraine. It was the largest military build-up on the border since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, with more than100,000 troopsin the area at the peak of the tensions. Justifications for this build-up were centered on it being a routine military exercise and the growing threat of NATO to Russia.
After a rather rapid escalation and then stagnation of tensions, Russian forces have still not fully withdrawn from the area. Thus, the question remains: is Russia an opportunist, taking advantage of an “opening” it found, or is this event a real, viable threat to regional stability? Is Russia trying to start an international war or is it merely testing Western waters to see what it can reap without damaging consequences?
The debate of whether Russia is an opportunist in the global arena has been at the center of Euro-Atlantic debatessince the mid-2010s.If Moscow operates in a zero-sum world, in which its economic and military goals are deeply intertwined, there could be more to this event than meets the eye. If not, it would follow many theorists’ opinions that this is nothing more than an opportunity taken by Moscow in a moment of“Western hesitation or inactivity”. In the case of Ukraine, the mere economic response via sanctions taken by the West in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, could be understood as relatively “low stakes” for Putin to risk in exchange for the reward of a new territory. So, a hypothetical annexation of Donbas – or even a more encompassing invasion of Ukraine – would also have a relatively low-risk factor, while delivering a relatively high reward factor.
Unfortunately the truth of what is really going on behind the scenes at the Kremlin is ultimately impossible to verify. The only source of information that can provide insights is the events themselves and the way that Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, presents the situation to his own constituents. In this way, Putin’s diplomatic rhetoric can provide a great insight into Russia’s geopolitical vision.
Putin has been talking about a “Great Power Competition” sincethe early 2000s, long before that phrase was common among scholars or world leaders, demonstrating that there is at least an outward focus on “show of force”, and the need for traditional, realist displays of strength and power. His political legacy, which he has developed since coming into power in 2000, has been similarly characterized by strongman qualities and outward demonstration of military and economic capacity.
Unafraid of pitting himself against US leadership, Putin has never shied away from accusing the US of being a superpower thatseeks a unipolar worldthrough what he deems “illegitimate” diplomatic and militaristic means. This approach signifies that Putin views Russia much like US leadership often views itself: as a “savior” which will “liberate” the world from opposing superpowers.In this way,Putin’s speech at the Munich Conference on Security Policy in 2007,in which he describes a world where the US is the ultimate aggressor in the global arena, sends a strong message to the Russian public and any other public which feels threatened by US power.
In his 2007 speech, Putin also points out a discretion in international norms. He affirms that legitimate military action is never attributed to any actors other than the West via NATO and the EU, instead of being something that is mediated through the UN. Moreover, Putin paints Russia as a victim of the West. A victim which can, of course, stand its own ground, but is constantly being cheated by a Western-made system that constantly points to Russia as an opponent, while centering itself as the source of democratic values and liberation. In other words, why would any military action abroad by US armed forces stand unchallenged by international organizations, while Russia’s would be immediately condemned?
Later on, in 2008, Putin said that he wanted Russia to be “as involved as possible in global and regional integration”, emphasizing the role that natural resources, like oil, would play. In relation to the case of Ukraine, there is a very strong geo-economic explanation, beyond the obvious geo-militaristic explanations, for Putin’s actions: Russia needs a landmass connection to its newly acquired warm water port in Crimea. Moreover, Putin’s strategic use of its own oil supply to create dependency puts Ukraine in an extremely vulnerable position. This was demonstrated when Putin completelycut Ukraine off of its energy suppliesin 2014, following a dispute over Ukraine’s gas debt.
After listening to Putin’sState of the Nation address this year, his moves on the Ukrainian border were almost predictable. Warning of “a red line not to be crossed” – a line that Putin would draw himself – the build-up at the border was very much just that: a response to the threat of NATO. Further, in his speech at the celebration of theanniversary of the “reunification”of Russia with Crimea on March 18, 2021, his rhetoric proposed the historical narratives aroundRussia’s “legitimate” claimto the territory of Crimea, harkening back to past land grabbing. These two speeches, when taken together, are very clearly a justification for his actions.
Even though Putin’s rhetoric shows trends and similarities over time, whether his efforts are strategized or opportunistic still remains debatable.To understand the situation in Ukraine further, there are other important factors to consider.
First, at the time of the escalation,Navalny had just been moved into the prison hospitalfollowinghis starvation protest against Putin. The US warned that his death would have triggered a retaliation if it happened at the hands of Russian authorities. The international focus on Navalny could have allowed Putin to make strategic moves with minimal international attention. Moreover, Navalny’s release and the symbolism of the abuse of his human rights remains a top priority for the US but ultimately detracts from the focus on the near crisis in Ukraine.
Second,Russian-Belarusian relations have thrived since theongoing protests– ended in police violence – against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have isolated the latter from the international community. Tightening relations with a free nation that remains between the “Great Powers” of the East and West could legitimize further “reunifications” of former Soviet states with Russia. In other words, it will be important to watch the tightening of relations between Belarus and Russia, because it can ultimately bolster Russian confidence in its ability to continue land grabbing efforts.
Third,significant changes in global leadership, including the election of US President Biden and theupcoming departureof German Prime Minister Angela Merkel both provide an opportunity for Putin to make significant moves geopolitically during a time of Western “weakness” and “instability”. On a similar note, Biden’s reinvigoration of US relations with international organizations, which Former President Trump sought to move away from (or leave altogether), has proven threatening to Putin. Namely, Putin’s military build-up in Ukraine can be, at least partially be attributed to anincrease in the threat by the US-NATO alliance. The way that US-Russia and EU-Russia relations develop over the course of 2021 will set the tone for the next steps Putin takes in Ukraine.
Finally,Russian pipeline projectshave serious political implications. Just like Putin mentioned in his early speeches, natural resources play an important role in his geo-economic and geo-political strategies. As was already mentioned, Putin’s move tocut Ukraine off of its energy suppliesin 2014 following a dispute over Ukraine’s gas debt, shows both willingness and capacity to use Russian pipelines in a strategic, militaristic manner. Most recently, Putin has already threatened to use the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline tocut Donbas off of oil in a retaliatory actfor Ukrainian aggression in the area. The upcomingTurkstream projectcan, and most likely will, eventually serve a similar purpose.
As mentioned, though the near crisis is “over”, at least in ade factosense, the number of troops at the Ukrainian-Russian borderhas not actually decreased, remaining around 100,000, along with weaponry that could be used forrapid escalation.Putin stated that he intendsto continue building up troops, despite international backlash. Since the near crisis, important international meetings have taken place which can provide insight into the severity of the conflict in the eyes of the international community.
The G7 meeting, held from June 11-13, 2021, focused heavily on the threat of China, but also addressed Russian aggression, under the more encompassing premise that the G7 has anobligation to resist authoritarianism. However, on June 14 at the NATO summit, President Biden reiterated thatUkraine is not yet ready for NATO accession. That being said, Biden was careful not to inspire doubts of American support for Ukraine and on June 18th, major news sources reported that the Biden administration had set asidea military aid package worth tens of millions of dollars,including lethal weaponry, for Ukraine, in case Putin should decide to continue the aggression.
Right before the G7 meeting and the NATO summit, Russiawithdrew from the Open Skies Treatyon June 8, 2021 (note: the initiation of the decision began in January 2021). The multilateral agreement no longer includes the US, sincePresident Trump withdrew in 2019, citing Russian violation of the treaty as his motivation to withdraw. However, it still includes the majority of the European Union and many former Soviet states, including Ukraine.The Ukrainian Foreign Minister noted that, “Russia is completing a course that it deliberately began in the mid-2000s… Through the destruction of arms control regimes, Russia created the conditions for covert preparations for sudden armed aggression against Georgia and Ukraine. Russia continues this aggressive expansionist course to this day.”
Moreover, international agreements meant to preserve coherence are not currently protecting Ukraine to the fullest extent that they could. Uncertainty over EU/NATO accession and an increasingly distant Russia from the international arena are reasons to be concerned when it comes to regional security. Whether Russia, specifically Putin, is an opportunist or an intentional aggressor with a grander plan, remains uncertain and though this remains an important debate, it is clear that in the case of Ukraine, Western actors should certainly not relax yet as this near crisis remains very much on the brink of becoming a serious, full-blown international conflict.

Dune and Data Colonization,"One of the most evocative images from the movieDune, adapted fromThe Dune Seriesby Frank Herbert, has been the vision of “spice melange” slipping through the fingers of the protagonist, Paul Atreides. Commentators have drawn understandable parallels between the spice in the Dune series andoilin the 20thcentury.However, in the contemporary era, the new oil is data.This fact has led to the manifestation of concepts such as data localization and data colonization. This struggle is also mirrored in the Dune series, with the resistance of the Fremen on the planet Arrakis, where the spice melange is found.
Spice melange, referred simply as “spice” in the Dune universe, is synonymous with power. In fact, it is essential for space travel, as it empowers specificusers to foresee the future.Thus, its importance is tantamount to the significance of data fordata-dependent technologies.For example, data is imperative for space travel, especially for Artificial Intelligence (AI)initiativesduring deep space exploration missions.
Spice was found in everything on Arrakis, including in the air and water on the planet.Spice was ubiquitous on Arrakis, as is data on Earth in the 21stCentury.However, the control of the spice was the catalyst of conflict between theHarkonnensand theHomerically-styledAtreides. As stated above, spice was essential for space travel and space navigation. Thus different factions, such as theBene Gesserit‘s “Sisterhood”, sought to benefit from the spice trade. Others, such as the Spacing Guild, prescribed members consumed the spice to gain prescience, so as to be able totravel safelythrough space. Thereby, these factions acquired a monopoly over space transportation and communication making it a highly profitable enterprise indeed, that prompted the extreme commodification of spice.
In theDunebooks, the antagonist observes “he who controls spice, controls the universe”.This echoes remarks by India’s Prime Minister, who posited that ‘the one who controls data, will be the world leader”.This acknowledgement has resulted in discourses and debates on data localization, and an enhanced emphasis on data colonization.Data colonialism combines the predatory extractive practices of historical colonialism with the abstract quantification methods of computing.
Data colonialism is perpetuated by conglomerates such as Alphabet and Facebook, who are involved in data extraction and are part of a “cryptocolonialist system”.Similarly, in Dune, the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles (CHOAM) controls, processes and benefits from spice. Great Houses are also in control of spice harvesting and processing. This bears an uncanny resemblance to conglomerates that are profiting from data andfightingdata localization efforts in developing nations. ThePadishah Emperor, who controls CHOAM and decides the fates of the Great Houses, resides on a faraway planet called Kaitain. From there, he exploits the spice extracted from Dune to guarantee the uninterrupted expansion of his galactic empire, the Imperium.
The myriad uses of data and spice have both promulgate a culture of extraction, expansion and exploitation.In the movie and the novels, the protagonist andprophesied savior, Paul Atreides, is part of a legacy of colonist malfeasance. In his upbringing, value was only placed upon the appropriation of Arrakis’ assets, including spice.
Notably, spice and data alike render humans asobjects, prone to external control.The extraction of spice came to define social and power hierarchies in Dune. It spawned a system of government that was benefiting frominfrastructure, order, and systemthat revolved around spice. This is eerily familiar to predictions that are being put forth by experts. In fact, they discern the advent of infrastructure fixated on data extraction and data appropriation. These practices tie humans to an emerging social order and government system, propped up byrationality and a new model of knowledge. In turn, this model is based on the monopolization of data, atotalizing endeavor.
Consequently, just as spice is taken out of the planet of Arrakis to benefit the shareholders of CHOAM, so is data taken out of developing nations to the benefit of the shareholders of major information conglomerates in the developed world.Data is taken out to be processed and stored in locations that are out of thegeographical boundaries and legal jurisdictionof countries where they originate from.This has major security ramifications, particularly from firms backed by state actors, including the Communist Party of China (CPC). Coincidentally, China has some of the mostcomprehensivedata localization laws on the planet, along with Russia.
The interests of state actors are given precedence in regard to data.This is the result of the monetary value of flows of data, which continue to generatenew infrastructure, new monopolies, new sources of economic growth, and new political movements. This mirrors the importance of spice to the Imperium as an enabler of expansion and affluence in the Known Universe. Additionally, the Great Houses owned equipment such as spice Harvesters, Spotters, and Carryalls. In parallel, conglomerates control the data centers and their locations. In this way, they can to circumvent legal frameworks and regulations enacted by the data originator countries and gain control of data flows, thereby perpetuating ‘digital imperialism’.
Moreover, conglomerates’ commitment todata infrastructure investmentin the countries where they are extracting data from is extremely disproportionate to the benefit reaped by their shareholders.This is analogous to the treatment doled out by the Great Houses to the Fremen. Furthermore, a larger trend is observed by strategic analysts. That is, a new colonial thrust to alter human existence into torrents ofdata for economic value and political power. This has provided avenues forunprecedented social discrimination and behavioural influenceby conglomerates, as was done on Dune.
However, the Fremen on Dune were able to regain their agency and work towards terraforming their planet, a multi-generational endeavour.Experts likewise would prefer efforts aimed atdecolonisationof data to take place.This would place the agency of the use of personal data at the behest of the individual. Furthermore, data could be used for the collective good and for collective use, which means working actively towards “data universalism”.
Nevertheless,emerging dimensions of data, including health data(which has been referred to as the “open frontier”)make it impossible for conglomerates to relinquish their control of data.This has also led to renewed concern in regard to its repercussions fornational securityin biotechnology. Particularly relevant is the case of China’s acquisition ofethnically diversehealth data from the US.
Finally, spice was opined to have immortalizing properties. This gave impetus to the increasing rivalry for the control of spice between the various factions. The clash only came to end during theruleof “God Emperor of Dune”, and was resumed soon after his reign ended. Notably, God Emperor was able to achieve a form of immortality with the help of spice producing sand worms or their infantile form, sandtrouts.Data, throughmachine-learning algorithms, can approximate a unique personality or at least some part of it, thereby offering a chance at immortality.This is likely to exploited by corporations with access to the highest amount of data.

[ANALYSIS] The Geopolitical Context of Increased Involvement of Great Powers and Middle Powers in Central Asia,"Investment in modes of transportation, the attainment of strategic depth, as well as the lure of natural resources has led to many countries to seek access to the Central Asia region. However, countries must surmount the barrier imposed by the region’s landlocked predicament, along with the increasing ability of the Central Asian Countries (CAC) to play to their strength through abundant natural resources such as through hydrocarbons, uranium, and agricultural output, which can be harnessed efficiently due to low labor costs. This has naturally prompted a torrent of attention from the colossuses residing on the continent and region. Notably, China, whose One Belt One Road Initiative (BRI) christenedthe new lever of the balance of power, is contingent on the cooperation of the CAC. Moreover, Chinarequiresthe CAC to gain access to the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea.
China has been “a convenient partner” to CAC, but to guarantee its influence, access, and the success of BRI, China is emerging as Central Asia’s biggest customer for hydrocarbons, construction of the Eurasian Landbridge through the CAC and its principal external investor. Additionally, BRI seeks to build a regional community of shared interests and norms, where China desires to contribute to global governance. China aspires to play a more significant role by bringing its development model to the international spotlight. This is part of the Beijing agenda to emerge as a rule maker instead of a rule-taker in the US-led world order. The latter has already been demonstrated in Kazakhstan where the BRI has been utilized as a vehicle to build a web of nations that adhere toChinese cyber policies and standardsas well as employ Chinese technologies.
However, involvement in the region is also a security imperative forChinaas Kazakhstan borders the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) which has beenreportedto have separatist intentions brewing in the province’s ethnic Uighur population. Another concerning development has been the deployment of Chinese troops alongside Tajikistan’s south-eastern border across from Afghanistan and theWakhan corridorwhich could emerge as part of the Chinese calculations in case of a US withdrawal from the region.
TheUShas utilized Central Asia’s strategic location to achieve its logistical and combat goals in Afghanistan with CAC granting the US access to land and air routes to send supplies to its troops and the same routes have been projected to be employed in the case of a US withdrawal which could signal a diminution of US influence in the region. However, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan have been assessed to be the direct recipients of US generosity. Moreover, the US has been working on the “Greater Central Asia”, wherein South and Central Asia are to be regarded as a single unit. This concept has been propounded to be leveraged to shield India’s geostrategic concerns in Central Asia with the construction of transport links including a railway line, expansion of power lines, and extension of communication grids. The US has also been in pursuit of the advancement of the C5+1 which was demonstrated in a recent virtual meeting organized by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken focusing on a diverse range of sectors such as “economy, energy and environment, and security“.
The eternal leviathan of the region, Russia, inevitably casts a long shadow over the CAC. Historically, the existence of a system of spheres that encompass CAC has been perceived by Russia to be operationally functional as layers of protection from adversaries and bridgeheads for proceeding forward in an unending pursuit of supremacy, control, and security. Furthermore, Russian aspirations include the transformation of the region into a “zone of privileged interest”. Shrewdly, Russia is working towards the accomplishment of this objective through a string of military bases as well as economically under the guise of integration by the means of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).
CAC had been utilizing a delicate balancing act to counter the creeping influence of the Russian and Chinese hegemonic institutions, actions, and intentions in the region. This commanded immense collaboration between the CAC and has prompted the enhancement of intra-regional relations. Russia is vehemently opposed to the development of intra-regional ties and instead prefers regional organizational structures which are either founded or controlled by Russia in order to consolidate Russian control and protection of its interest in the region. However, the CAC has been focusing on and studying the functioning structures of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Nordic Council. These models are likely to preserve the individual autonomy of the CAC and lead to the creation of a regional common.
Another player in the region since the disintegration of the Soviet Union has been Pakistan which has been looking for a foothold in Central Asia for the establishment of a regional Islamic commonwealth or a security belt extending from Turkey to Pakistan and the CAC as “the buckle”. The intention behind these aspirations is the attainment ofstrategic depthas well as the attainment of multiple partners to back Pakistani interests in Kashmir and Afghanistan. The CAC has not been tempted to respond to Pakistanigambitsdue to the historical bequest of the Pakistani support to the Mujahideen during the civil war, the secular principles espoused by the CAC, along with the Sufi influences present in the region.
Other countries which are vying for influence in the region and, therefore, impact the regional power balance include Japan, Iran, South Korea, and Turkey. Turkey has conspicuously appeared in the foreign policy strategies of every one of the CAC. There are profound historical linkages, and the reliance of CAC was deepened after their independence when Turkey lend substantial support for entry onto the international milieu and into the international organizations including financial and political backing. The CAC is counting onTurkey’s help to shore them upwhile Ankara focuses on the hydrocarbonreservesin the Caspian Sea. This has led to an intense contestation between Russia which considers any intrusion in CAC to be a threat to its regional interests and Turkey in the region.
Additionally, South Korea has been fixated on engaging and acquiring stakes in the CAC energy sphere. The Korea National Oil Corporation and the Korea Gas Corporation have been interested in exploration rights in gas fields. The companies have acquired rights in Turkmenistan to construct a gas treatment industrial unit. In 2008, the Uzbek government concluded a Memorandum of Understanding with South Korean investors to modernize an airport for the purpose of its transformation into a key air conveyance center which increased commerce and people-to-people ties. In Kazakhstan, agreements were signed for the construction of a petrochemical compound and an electric power plant. Therefore, South Korea is carving itself a niche area wherein its construction prowess is put to good use in the pursuit of its energy security diversification. Furthermore, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have provided South Korea with uranium for its nuclear energy shortfall.
In the international multilateral organizations such as the UN, the majority of the CAC has backed Japan’s entry into Security Council and supported South Korea on the same forum. Political support for the CAC is, however, buoyed by the common discernible threads which are mutual security threat perceptions such as the unrelenting volatility in Afghanistan which has exacerbated the cross-border challenges related to drug trafficking, extremism, radicalization, and terrorism. Furthermore, CAC and South Korea have a shared empathetic understanding of duty in relation to transnational security in particular for the promotion of stability in Asia. South Korea’s capabilities in the spheres of pioneering technologies, including energy and water-saving technologies which the CAC considers a necessity, have provided South Korea with an opportunity to expand its footprint in the region including in the military domain by sellingmilitary hardwarefor border protection to Uzbekistan.
Another country with enormous potential for investing in the region has been Iran. This has already been witnessed in the CAC’s close relations with Iran, membership in the Tehran-based Economic Cooperation Organization, and that Iran has been employed by some countries to act as acounterweightto Russia’s influence in the region. Iran has also been working towards trying to discover convergences with the CAC which includes the Afghan peace process, which has massive implications for the Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan–Afghanistan–Iran (KTAI) transit corridor. Notably, Tehran is trying to leverage its geographic position to connect the landlocked CAC to international waters. This has led to apprehension from Russia which prefers that China’s BRI-related initiativespass through its territory to attract the infrastructure investmentsand acquire a considerable part oftransit from trade moving from China to Europeand back.
Regional political linkages are correspondingly accentuated by mutual security threats including the sustained instability in Afghanistan and challenges which are proliferating across the continent due to the ensuing instability. The balanced configuration of the Central Asian nation’s relations with multiple powers operating in the region displays astutely developed multi-vector balancing strategies particularly considering the overshadowing presence of Russia and China in the region. However, the political state in Central Asia is in flux with local leaders who have become susceptible to increasing foreign influence and therefore are pursuing political agendas that are not sustainable or not in line with the future dividends.
Notably, India, as an emerging power in the emerging multipolar world order, is focusing on security collaborations which could also lead to linkages such as joint research opportunities directed at military-defense concerns, counterterrorism efforts, and the Afghanistan factor which is ever-present in the periphery. However, there is a dire need for economic and connectivity ties. Nevertheless, India is evolving a discerning result-oriented outlook and, as such, is nurturing constructive relations in the region on the bedrock of stability and security in the hopes of the commencement of a trickle-down effect in the region. India is working to broaden the strategic edge and open the imagination to look to the region lying beyond Pakistan and China for future engagement and opportunities.
The CAC is developing dangerous dependencies on China as linkages andeconomic dynamismresult in convergence of political conveniences, reciprocal interdependency, and dissemination of security concerns. The Chinese are following a unilateral strategy in Central Asia and a multilateral strategy globally. This is likely to increase the threat perception of powers operating in the region. India requires active Russian support to emerge as a leader in the region to advance its interest as well as influence in the region. Central Asia has been said to be more a geographic grouping rather than a region composed of shared histories, interests, identities, or even ambitions which have given major openings to foreign players including China.","July 21, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-geopolitical-context-of-increased-involvement-of-great-powers-and-middle-powers-in-central-asia/,Arushi Singh,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The Epoch of Cognitive Warfare: Realities and Ramifications,"Recently, China accused the US of employing cognitive warfare when aphotographemerged of two US naval officers unflappably watching aChinese aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. Experts interpreted it as signalling to China that the US is “watching“. China itself has been accused of utilising cognitive warfare during the Covid-19 pandemic againstTaiwan and other Western countries. China’s focus has also evolved frominformatization tointelligentization, which was outlined in its2019 Defense White Paperand is slated to become the “prevailing form of war“. China has been working onintelligentized technologies and operational concepts.
There are multiple challenges that are being brought forth by the weaponization of the cognitive domain by various countries. Cognitive warfare signals a shift away from conventional military parity and diffusion of warfare. The era of mass customization of various modes of online communication and information has dawned. In this environment, cognitive warfare is executed through the utilization of different platforms, including social media, where messages, beliefs, views, and narratives can be influenced, persuaded, and altered forcognitive advantages, without having to resortto outright force or coercion.
The speed and the extent of information propagation have been tremendously boosted by technological innovations and advancements. This can have a massive impact on the geopolitical landscape of the world without initiating kinetic military warfare. As such, both state and violent non-state actors are employing the technology and psychology understanding to wage cognitive warfare on nations that might not even be prepared for such tactics and their magnitude. Consequently, countering cognitive warfare requires organizationally innovative action, which is backed by a persistent change in face of evolving technologies.
Cognitive Warfare has transformed the concept of ‘below the threshold’ conflictand is at the critical juncture of becoming the norm. The trust which is the linchpin of a country’s “strategic strength” can be negated using cognitive warfare with minimal utilization of resources, while results are maximized. Successful manipulation of asymmetrical methods and unconventional means encompassing non-kinetic and non-lethal delivery, propagated through digital avenues, have removed the epicentre of political battle from armed war to a narrative war contested in the minds of the public. Cognitive warfare can also be waged for the explicit purposes of nurturing apprehensions regardinggovernance, subverting democratic processes, triggering civil disturbances, or instigating separatist movements. This is done through reinforcing cognitive biases,innate reasoning, and critical incident decision-makingfallacies.
Cognitive warfare has been defined as a “disinformation process to psychologically” and gradually weaken the recipients of the information, thus directing public discourse. This is done to manufacture cracks in societal harmony and to damage confidence in institutions. The information is purposefully propagated and amplified through social media, fake news, online platforms, leaks, videos, politically sensitive information, as well as photographs altered to be “out of context and political cartoons”, for the purpose of acquiring a competitive edge over the adversary. The target viewers can then espouse the stance being propagated to further strategic or operational objectives of the actors engaging in cognitive warfare more effortlessly and unknowingly. Cognitive warfare is also the weaponization of “techno-social engineering” which examines the processes wherein technologies and societal influences sway thoughts, perceptions, and actions.
Cognitive doctrine is exemplified in the RussianGerasimov Doctrine, where the goal is to cultivate perpetual strife and turmoil to weaken the enemy state from within. Moreover, artificial intelligence and its incorporation in complicated anthropological structures, which aim for behavioural intercessions, can further aggravate these concerns. However, countering cognitive warfare is made explicitly more difficult due to challenges, such as cognitive warfare possessing a significantly lower threshold, being considerably harder to detect and deter with the capacity to easily surge across intertwined systems, exacerbated by low investment inprotectingdata integrity and restoring it. Moreover, contemporary asymmetric conflicts with no clear victors and methods have made the narrative building paramount.
Haphazardly regulated areas of the cyber domain can result in these technologies and skills being sold to the highest bidders, be they state actors or violent non-state actors. This proliferation can then lead to an increase in cognitive warfare, which will further strain the infrastructure and expand distrust in institutions with an inability to counter or deter tactics in cognitive warfare, likely resulting in a vicious cycle. Furthermore, below the threshold conflict, owing to the emerging cognitive combat zone has transmuted to require more than just the strengthening of non-lethal capacities of states to contain it, as it possesses the potential to transform into a conventional war. To fight on the cognitive battlefield requires constant, “hyper-competitive, multi-domain” struggle while managing flexibility as well as volatility. This additionally necessitates preserving consistency of tactical, non-intuitive, and strategic aims while thwarting unrelenting strikes.
Technology continues toalterhuman bodies and minds, including memory, interests, attention and sleep cycles. The advent of brain stimulation devices, brain-machines, and interfaces aided by machine learning have led to the exploration of intricate forms of movements in a brain when considering a particular figure, reading, even a distinct emotion or discovery of new information. Through this information, researchers can better understand cognitive functions, such as the distinction between cognitive fortes and limitations of individuals, and identify certain views, perceptions and emotions, as well as the misrepresentation of motives and values. This better understanding can then be utilized to cut off “historical memory”, so that victims will be receptive to new beliefs, focusing on leaders to shift their ideological pivots; “deconstructing symbols” to question national identity. These new developments can give enormous leverage to the adversary or can be misdirected to be used to incite allies of the adversary.
Russia employs information operations to provoke internal schisms within the Baltic countries which destabilize politics and undermine institutions, for instance by casting doubt on voting results. Furthermore, democratic countries are most vulnerable during elections; as such, cognitive warfare empowered by other Russian cyber capabilities amassed at the time of elections can effectively disrupt elections. The cognitive battlefield is strewn with propaganda and misinformation to consistently set a context, including “instrumentalization of historical memory”, assertions of the negation of Baltic states’ functioning, while playing up to the cultural and linguistic heritage of Russia to gain an upper hand. These developments have resulted in the conceptualisation of thePrimakov doctrine, whose aims include a multipolar world order, cooperation with China, Russian domination in the post-Soviet space, and putting upopposition to NATO enlargementwhile ensuring the indispensability of Russia in the global order. The Primakov doctrine also involves astrategy to pre-empt political backlash to Russian initiatives, which may culminate into large scale implementation of cognitive warfare.
In a different sphere, perceptions of technology as “just tools” in governmental institutions contradicts the users of these technologies, who encounter technologies as carriers of significance, inspirations, and “extensions” of those users. This disengagement between understanding emotional attachment, which is likely to increase, with a surge in interaction and the level of emotional connection makes exploiting citizens of an adversarial country markedly easier. Instead of being prepared, the surprise element of the warfare is undoubtedly enhanced. Cognitive warfarepreyson and intends to, persuade a rival to let down their guard and make room for complacency, which can then be exploited. The “semantic memory” becomes predisposed to manipulations as well.
Henceforth, to counter cognitive warfare, non-partisan and unbiased institutional frameworks are required. These intuitions should be enabled to scrutinize, supervise, and verify the veracity of election results and the election process. Political parties and campaigns must be expected to allot resources towards cybersecurity and for cyber literacy so politically sensitive information cannot be used for cognitive warfare. Additionally,laws, such as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, empower private industry to share information with the government without being deprived of a competitive edge or being embroiled in legal quagmires, which can lead to a more robust cognitive security environment.
Two divisions of cognitive influencing technologies can be utilized for cognitive warfare. The first is related to the capability to think and functionality through cognitive surveying, interference and strengthening technologies. The second is subliminal cognition that focuses on technologies that influence basic emotions, beliefs awareness, and drive throughprocessing, implanting, and detecting technologies. Furthermore, negative cognitive exertions prevent thedevelopmentof undesirable cognitive conditions while positive cognitive efforts yield a preferred awareness.
Evolution in technology also leads to the evolution of vulnerabilities including cognitive susceptibilities. This is aggravated by the progressively falling cost of the technology which permits different actors to penetrate the sphere where state actors are swayed by “legal and policy” concerns, giving impetus to instability. This is further exacerbated by the erosion of diplomatic power of countries due to the narratives proliferated through cognitive warfare, which question the legitimacy of governments and the supportive institutional framework. To maintain stability and trust in institutions, positive messages which reinforce fundamental societal values and principles have proved to beeffective.
Cognitive warfareintegrates cyber, information, psychological, and social engineering capabilities to achieve its ends. This has highlighted a fundamental disconnect between countries that utilize cognitive warfare, such as Russia, which perceive themselves perpetually positioned to be engaged in information warfare, while the West views the engagement as only temporary. This perceptionaffectsresource allocation, collaboration, expanding adaptability through feedback and follow-through on operations.
A department with interdisciplinary personnel focused on cognitive security through information mapping, capable of conducting the coordinated inter-agency planned operation, is needed. This is particularly concerns the mutating nature of the warfare, as well as aspects such as information overload, which makes people more susceptible to cognitive warfare and superficial signals, including the appearance of impartiality. This can lead to more amenability. Efforts to combat cognitive warfare should include: capacity-building for continual sustained warfare, disinformation education campaigns, enacting election-related cyber safety measures, executing a regulatory framework for a coordinated response by ally states,investingin periodic simulation exercises, and strengthening the sharing of intelligence and best practices.
The cognitive security framework must take these differences into account when forming mechanisms for countering cognitive warfare. Moreover, the underlying conditions which might be societal, political, and economic may act as facilitators and, as such, cannot be ignored while constructing institutional frameworks. However, hurried counter-cognitive actions may prove similarly detrimental as the extent of collateral damage can be enormous. Immense consideration is required to discern external interference and meddling from valid, genuine, and guarded freedom of speech of political actors within the country itself. Authenticity and credentials must be properly and thoroughly checked to discredit the adversary before launching counter-cognitive action, as escalation is an extremely likely scenario. The outcomes are incremental, and it is challenging to gauge their impact.  However, there have been reports of situations when inaction was disadvantageous to societal resilience.
As the world becomes multipolar, the rising powers are likely to pursue strategies that will confront the capabilities of rival nations to counter. Cognitive warfare may just be the start of a new era of confrontation and competition, as well as of “cumulative gains”. Cognitive warfare is rewriting presumptions of contemporary warfare while the potent mixture of technology, insight into human psychology, and the calculated motivation to employ these judiciously at unparalleled speeds is likely to be lethal.

Sexual and Reproductive Rights: The EU Keeps Moving,"The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in 1994 in Cairo, Egypt was welcomed as a ground-breaking initiative, promising to enhance women’s rights. The idea was to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive rights. 179 governments, 11,000 participants from governments, UN specialized agencies and organizations, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, media – all of them came together to discuss the relationship between population and development.
Equality meant empowering women; a result not only beneficial per se, but one which also concerned sustainable development. Complementary to this discourse was the focus on reproductive health, defined as:
“A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, […] Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice”.
Because the ICPD; the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995); the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979); the Millennium Development Goals before and the Sustainable development goals after, constitute a powerful source of guidance for the change we want to achieve. However, what has been done so far leaves room for improvement.
To do more and do it faster was also the goal expressed during the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 in 2019. At the 25th anniversary of the ICPD, the governments of Kenya and Denmark, and UNFPA, stated the will to intensify their political and financial efforts in an action that was summarized as “three zero”: zero unmet need for family planning information and services, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls. To address the three zeros and the broader ICPD agenda, the Summit focused on five themes, among which we can find universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.
On 24th June 2021, with 378 votes in favour, 255 against, and 42 abstentions, the Members of European Parliament (MEPs) adopted the resolution: “Sexual and reproductive health and rights in the EU, in the frame of women’s health”.
The resolution states in clear terms that sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) is “an essential element of human dignity and is intrinsically linked to the achievement of gender equality and combating gender-based violence”.
SRHR, according to WHO, is an umbrella term. Its meaning covers a full range of issues that include:
Sexual health (as the right to see bodily integrity, privacy, and personal autonomy respected);
Sexual rights ( concerning sexual orientation and gender identity);
Reproductive health (as to decide whether, with whom, and when to be sexually active; to have safe sexual experiences);
Reproductive rights (as services and support necessary for family planning).
“In particular, sexual and reproductive health rights are fundamental women’s rights which should be enhanced and cannot in any way be watered down or withdrawn”, thus MEPs invite the Member States to promote and safeguard the right of  “informed choices concerning SRHR, to ensure the right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy, equality, and non-discrimination, and to provide the necessary means to allow everyone to enjoy SRHR”.
The report mentions particularly six different fields on which the actions of Member States should focus to guarantee the enjoyment of, and universal access to, SRHRs. They are:
Lastly, in this resolution, MEPs stress the cruciality of SRHR as a pillar of gender equality, democracy, and the elimination of gender-basedviolence. Thus, they invite the Member States to cooperate and come together, to establish concrete good practices and a uniform action to address the challenges that this field entails.

The Palm Oil Havoc in Indonesia,"Palm oil is the most used vegetable oil in the world. According to the most recentFAO update, 71 million tons of oil palm were produced in 2018. However, the conventional system of oil palm production is responsible for significant damage to the environment and local communities.AndIndonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer, is also one of the most affected, with its palm oil palm plantations causing deforestation, fires, air and water pollution, and loss of animals and plants. But we don’t have to look at it as a problem restricted only to nature.
Environmental deteriorationhas meant a disruption to the life of entire communities living around that damaged ecosystem, especially Indigenous communities. There is an urgency to have stronger environmental protection and transition to sustainable oil palm management, through the recognition that behind the impacts on the environment are the inevitable impacts on people’s lives.
The environmental impacts of oil palm plantations in Indonesia are significant. Deforestation is the largest effect of plantation expansion, with huge environmental implications. Not only does it account for a big part ofGHG emissions, it also results in altering the overall balance of nature, with loss of plants and animal species living in the forest, and air pollution from the burning of trees. Another concerning consequence is river pollution, caused by oil palm mills and the pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers that flow into rivers close to the plantations.
The environmental degradation dramatically impacts Indigenous communities living in the expansion areas, especially with concern to health, livelihoods, and socio-cultural balance. For Indigenous communities, livelihood depends primarily on nature, through traditional subsistence activities such as agriculture, fishing, and gathering. And when nature is destroyed life is destroyed. Deforestation and land expropriation also result in the loss of resources that are fundamental for monetary and non-monetary gain. Lost resources include fruit and vegetables, medicinal plants, and firewood. Families who lose their income from forest products and from the land they have to sell, struggle for daily survival and to pay for their children’s education.
In aninterview with Human Rights Watch, a 38-year-old woman with her child describes this situation: “My daughter attends high school in Jagoi and had to drop out … because I have no money. […] I had a kiosk and my husband would go to the forest, cut wood, and sell when there was a big expense like school needs. Now there is no forest.” People have no access to drinking water due to the poor water quality of polluted rivers. By killing marine life, river pollution also deteriorates small-scale fisheries, which catch fish that is consumed locally.
A Human Rights Watch report investigating the impacts of oil plantations on Indigenous communities living in North Barito has also raised concerns about food security. In a context where daily diets consist of rice, fish, and forest resources, and where additional revenue comes from selling non-timber forest resources, losing the ability to have self-providing food and the money to buy it cause these communities to lose the ability to feed themselves and their families.
In the words of Paulina, a 37-year-old woman from Semunying Bongkang, as reported byHuman Rights Watch:
“I can’t provide food every day like before. Before the company, I used to plant rice and vegetables on a small piece of land. I would use the harvest to feed my family. Now, I plant a little behind my house, not much, and it doesn’t do well like in my farm before.”
However, how has the oil palm exploitation system been put in place, and why does it continue to function while perpetuating socio-environmental damage? Indonesia’s institutional dimension plays a big role, with decentralized governance, a weak legal system and endemic corruption. Local governments and military officials use their legal mandates to favor oil palm companies on land allocation, and they often facilitate illegal cutting and logging. Poor data transparency and overlapping jurisdiction at the national and local level have obstructed the implementation of laws on property and the environment. Moreover, corruption and low-quality governance by local officials have allowed relationships of favoritism and manipulation of the judiciary system by the oil palm companies.
Another factor to address is the weakness of the environmental legal protection framework. In the case of Indonesia, multiple regulations and certification schemes for palm oil production are in place, but they fail to address accountability and to prevent violations from the industry. The most famous body is the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which has developed a set of environmental and social criteria for companies in order to produce Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO).
Even if it has raised the issue and increased the commitment to sustainable oil palm management, this multi-stakeholder initiative has revealed many gaps, allowing the continuation of unsustainable operations. There is a lack of data, lack of transparency, and no mechanism to ensure that policies are properly implemented. The compliance system is not strong enough, leading companies to keep circumventing and violating regulations. Onerecent auditconducted by the government agency, the BPK, found that 81% of Indonesia oil palm plantations violate the existing regulations.
In 2011, the Indonesian government decided to develop a national scheme, the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO), with the aim to complement the gaps of the existing mechanisms. However, this scheme reflects inadequate standards of transparency and human rights. Compared to the RSPO, the international community considers ISPO not strong enough to be vigilant on companies and to protect the most vulnerable. Overall, the legal mechanisms in place are not strong enough to push the transition to sustainable oil palm management. In the report“Destruction: Certified”, Greenpeace talks about oil palm certifications as being tools that enable “destructive businesses to continue operating as usual.”
The dynamics of oil palm exploitation in Indonesia are part of the bigger system of our globalized society, where the economic dimension and economic actors dominate.We talk about commodification, which means the capitalist instrumentation of natural resources.Nature is not seen as a part of human balance, but as a tool of economic gain. Therefore, nature is exploited, and the side effects continue for those who are often the poorest and most vulnerable. The biofuel and food industries dependent on oil palm may create significant revenues for multinational corporations and governments in the region, but they almost never translate into benefits for villagers living in the areas of development. On the community side, what is evident is not poverty alleviation – as is often claimed – but instead the reinforcement of poverty through a change of its nature. This uneven system perpetuates global inequality and underdevelopment, while at the same time threatening the balance of the entire ecosystem.
The story of the palm oil industry in Indonesia has shown that the economic mechanisms described contribute to an increase in poverty, deteriorating the quality of life by destroying nature. And their environmental and human impacts spread from Indonesia to other parts of world. Two main takeaways can be drawn from this situation, both of them related to the concept of ecosystems. The first takeaway is that nature and humans are interdependent. This means that behind the environmental impacts are inevitable impacts on people’s lives. The second takeaway is that the planet’s ecosystem is interconnected. This means that the socio-environmental consequences of oil palm plantations in Indonesia are not limited to the region and Indigenous people. They are a global matter. Thinking about the impact of GHG emissions helps to conceptualize this.","October 24, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-palm-oil-havoc-in-indonesia/,Elisa Bianchini,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"Strategic Ambiguity, China, and Taiwan: The US-Taiwan Quagmire","The US-Taiwan quagmire has long been resolved through an understanding of strategic ambiguity. Before President Xi Jinping and President Biden, the two great powers used this strategic outlook to maintain peace and prosperity over the Taiwan Strait and its place within China.However, marking the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, President Xi declared that China would never bebullied, oppressed, or subjugatedby a foreign force under his leadership. Adding to the strong assertion was his proclamation of China’sunshakeable commitmentto unification with Taiwan. Thus, with growing diplomatic tension and strategic competition between the two great powers, Taiwan has emerged as one of the most contested international issues of this period that could trigger a great power-armed standoff or conflict.
During the early decades of the 20th century, China underwent a series of civil wars between the Kuomintang Nationalist-led government of the Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of Mao Zedong. Conflict occurred in two phases—1927 to 1936 and 1945 to 1949—resulting in the Nationalist-led government retreating to Taiwan in 1949.Being victorious the CCP asserted that there was only“one China”and that Taiwan was part of that policy.Since attaining power, the CCP has maintained that it is the only legitimate government of China and has proclaimed aOne-China principlethat declares Taiwan’s eventual unification with the mainland.
In the closing decade of the 20th century, China claimed that the 1992 Consensus bound Taiwan to China as it declared an understanding of the two geopoliticalsides of the strait belongingto the CCP’s One-China Policy while “working together for national reunification.” This understanding between the two political groups led to eventual closer ties between Taiwan and China. However, when Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),under the leadership of Tsai Ing-wen, won the 2016 election and was re-elected in 2020, and the DDPexplicitly refusedto accept the 1992 Consensus. Instead, the DPP leader argued that they were elected according to the Kuomintang Nationalist Constitution.
Under the Nixon administration, the US establishedformal diplomatic relationswith the CCP’s China, resulting inAmerica severingits diplomatic ties and abrogated its mutual defense treaty with Taiwan.However, the US has maintained anunofficial relationshipwith Taiwan and continues selling weapons to the Taiwanese military for its self-defense.These tactical decisions contributed to three Sino-US communiques in 1972, 1978, and 1982; the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979; and the Six Assurances conveyed to Taiwan in 1982.As a result, US diplomatic efforts towards China and Taiwan have developed a “strategic ambiguity” in America’s role in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
With China’s more assertive foreign policy gaining traction under President Xi and then-president Obama’s foreign policy pivot to the Indo-Pacific, the US deepened its diplomatic ties with Taiwan. During theTrump presidency, the US sold more than $18 billion of weapons to Taiwan’s military and unveiled a $250 million complex for its embassy in Taipei. President Biden has continued with Trump’s US strategic approach to Taiwan, going so far as to invite Taiwanese representatives to attend hispresidential inauguration.
Unlike his predecessors, who held a national policy that formulated China’s stance on living with thestatus quo of a de factoindependent Taiwan, Chinese President Xi Jinping has on numerous occasions publicly called for the progression of Taiwan’s unification with the mainland.
“Complete national reunification is an inevitable requirement for realizing the great juventation of the Chinese nation.”
For President Xi, the Taiwan quagmire has vital consequences for his Chinese Dream—Xi’s personal promise to advance China’spinnacle of power and prosperityby 2049—that will finalize China’s realization of itsgreat renewalas the regional hegemon and a reputable and vital global great power. Lastly, the Chinese Dream will correspond with the 100th anniversary of the CCP’s founding.As can be seen, Taiwan’s unification with the mainland ispersonal to President Xiand is complicated with his political desire to be projected into the same legacy stature as Mao Zedong.
The acceleration of China’s hard push for Taiwan’s reunification can be observed further through the nationalistic opinion among the Chinese population, the military, and bureaucratic elites.If public opinion polls are correct,70 percentof the Chinese population strongly support using military force in unifying Taiwan with China, with37 percentfavouring war with Taiwan over unification in the next three or five years. Moreover, President Xi is surrounded by military and bureaucratic advisersconfident in China’s military powerto regain Taiwan by force.
China’s recent assertive conduct to Taiwan, notably through its use ofaircraft incursionsinto Taiwan’s airspace, is worrisome.Nonetheless, it also needs to be observed through President Xi’s diplomatic takeaways from the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-96.In this moment of military escalation, China fired two sets of missiles intended to intimidate Taiwan’s then-president Lee Teng-hui from further contending the One-China policy and pressure the presidential electorate in the run-up to the Taiwanese 1996 election.Unfortunately for China, this event occurred during America’sunipolar moment, and when the US dispatchedtwo aircraft carrier battle groupsto the Strait, China immediately ceased its armed operation.
This moment in Sino-Taiwan relations has remained in the CCP’s collective memory, and China has since used the following25 years to modernizeits military to avoid similar deterrence from happening.With China’s military nearing its modernization and expansion into new technological forms of warfare, combined with its collective strategic desire to regain Taiwan, China now perceives thebalance of powerto absorb Taiwan to be in its favor.
The American approach to defend and deter conflict in the Taiwan Strait has been defined through strategic ambiguity. However, in the wake of growing Chinese dominance in military and hybrid capabilities, foreign policy experts and analysts—namely Richard Haass and David Sacks—argue foran unambiguous strategyto the Taiwan quagmire.They remark that US superiority in prevailing over a Taiwan conflict is no longer certain, along with emphasizing America’s ill-mannered strategy lacking clarity to the means for preparing the US military for an armed conflict and intervention in the Taiwan Strait.The overall lack of clarity to America’s strategic ambiguity places American Asia-Pacific leadership and power in jeopardy as “losing” Taiwan to China will have consequential effects on American security interests in the Indo-Pacific.
The first consequential fear is with China using Taiwan to project its hegemonic footprint across the region.For American military leaders, Taiwan’s natural geography as an island makes it aformidable and unsinkable aircraft carrierto project the state’s military capabilities. By absorbing Taiwan, China would havea suitable tactical advantage by fortifying its anti-access/area-denial (AS/AD) capabilities byextending China’s naval reachfor its attack and nuclear-armed submarines.Additionally, China would station its newDF-26 ballistic missilesin Taiwan. These military features provide China with extensivefirst-strike capabilitiesagainst US bases, naval flotillas, and its Asian allies.
The second consequential fear is the unraveling of the US regional hub-and-spoke system of alliances.With the fear of being unsuccessful in defending Taiwan from a Chinese military invasion or hesitant in defending the island, there is a worry that America’s like-minded Asian allies would feelabandonedand isolated by the existing US hub-and-spoke system.Such a blunder would see some allies—like Japan and South Korea—yield more readily toChinese territorial demandsor lead US allies to desire and develop nuclear weapons.The aforementioned fear contributes to the anxiety of the hub-and-spoke system of alliances to be dismantled, thereby removing theUS as a pivotal power in the Indo-Pacific, undermining its Asia-Pacific security interests and capabilities to influence regional norms and rules.
A third consequential fear concerns China nearly becoming self-sufficient in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips.As a quasi-independent actor, Taiwan holds an important place among the world’s top economic powers. For instance, it is the10th largest trading partnerfor the US and is a dominant global leader insemiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductor chips are foundational for mostcivilian and military electronics, and if Beijing were successful in unifying Taiwan, it could use this superiority with its powerfuleconomy to leverage countriesthat criticize China’s hegemonic projection.As the US has limited industrial capacity to manufacture these semiconductors, experts argue that this reality constitutes a threat to America’s national security in the Asia-Pacific.
To maintain peace and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait, the US needs to refine its strategy towards the US-Taiwan quagmire. UnlikeCharles Glaser—who proposes a retrenchment strategy—andBlake Herzinger—a traditional realist hawk—the best strategy is still one of ambiguity.Although China has increased its belligerent diplomatic and military outlook towards Taiwan, China will likely only considerinitiating armed unificationwhen President Xi is confident in the PLA’s ability to gain control of the island. Suppose American strategy towards Taiwan was clarified and outlined US commitments to protect the island’s autonomy and future independence,the probability of China initiating an armed unification towards Taiwan would undoubtedly increase and outright occur as President Xi regards this issue as an internal affair that puts Chinese sovereignty in jeopardy.
Strategic ambiguity, meanwhile, has aproven track recordfor affixing US security interests to Taiwan.With that said, strategic ambiguity to Taiwan needs refining to include specific tactical directives to prepare Taiwan and the US—and to an extent, US allies—for an armed conflict with China.Initiating such a process provides the US with strategic insight over how to make explicit that any acts by China towardsarmed unificationwill end President Xi’s Chinese Dream.To accomplish such a feat, the US needs to maintain and push forward more substantial trade agreements with Taiwan, including but not limited to anti-tank and anti-air missiles, ornaments and systems to medical supplies.
While China will condemn and demand a halt to such activities,the US should argue that these actions are simply maintaining the status quo that has provided peace and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait since the 1970s.However, America needs to emphasize to Taiwanese leaders that it will continue to conducttrade activities, even in the wake of a Chinese invasion. Although these strategic measures put US civilian and military forces in danger of Chinese first-strike capabilities,such commitments will have significant morale benefits for Taiwan.
For China to successfully unify Taiwan, it needs thecomplete capitulationof Taiwan’s leaders and civilian population.Such a mission is difficult today as more than64 percent of the Island’s residentsconsider themselves exclusively Taiwanese. If this population was guaranteed continued support from the US in supplying “public goods,”it would be likely that Taiwan could assemble a considerable resistance to the PLA.What is more, America’s military and political leaders should be aware of the major difference between successfully invading an area by force and successfully occupying and subduing a national resistance.After all, the US has extensive historical memories of these occurrences in its tenure as a great power.
Supplying and ensuring the success of such resistance will provide the US with sweeping tactical maneuverability. For one, it provides American armed forces, intelligence departments, and diplomatic agencies adequate time to mount a considerable force in response to any acts of aggression from China.Moreover, China will become the aggressor since it would unquestionably prevent American shipping to Taiwan. If China were to attack or block American shipping by force, it would confirm American sentiments of Chinese belligerence towards the rules-based order and any actors that defy its great power rise.Such a brash decision by China would undoubtedly merit a reasonable response from the US while generating support from allies within NATO and the US hub-and-spoke system to partner with America to push back against China in the Taiwan Strait.
For US strategic ambiguity to function, American political and military leaders need to anticipate China contributing a large-scale invasion, thereby showcasing the PLA’s eminent precession at attaining success and China’s great power status. If this occurs, American strategic ambiguity needs directives on the consequential effects it would have on China. First, the strategy should detail howTaiwan willstrain a significant portionof Chinese power through mounting a robust resistance to its occupational forces.Second, strategic directives need to emphasize thatChina has a limited window to divert more resources and personnel to Taiwan before America responds with a well-provisioned, tactically sound, and internationally supported force.Lastly, China needs to be made aware that the US and its allies are geostrategically positioned and supported within the Indo- and Asia-Pacific,resulting in China being enclosed with mounting military casualties and economic paralysis—with Europe, the US, Japan, South Korea and Canadasevering trade tieswith Chinawhile also making theSouth China Sea inaccessiblefor China to import or export public goods—as a result of its armed invasion of Taiwan.
By putting forward a refined strategic ambiguity to the Taiwan quagmire, the US can better position its great power competition and coexistence with China over peace and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait whilereinforcing its allies in the Indo- and Asia-Pacific.Moreover, by playing off President Xi’s desire to unify Taiwan with the mainland during his presidency,the US should impose upon the Chinese that absorbing Taiwan through force or armed coercion would have notable consequences to its leader’s Chinese Dream.","August 10, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/strategic-ambiguity-china-and-taiwan-the-us-taiwan-quagmire/,Andrew Erskine,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Israel Politics: More than One Month Without Netanyahu,"Israeli politics are something easy to get hooked on.There is something grotesque and exaggerated with the politics there that can make you obsessed. It was two years ago that the last political crisis Israel suffered started. The recently formed government crumbled under its own weight. That episode started a two-year cycle of political stagnation and ended with the ousting of the longest-standing Prime Minister Israel had ever seen.A month has passed since the very unlikely government coalition came into office, and the changes are noticeable.
What did it take to oust Netanyahu? An unlikely coalition that put together a former loyalist, a TV host, and – for the first time ever – an Arab. In fact, the pressure that Netanyahu put on the Israeli political system created the conditions for certain parties – that six months prior were perhaps unlikely to sit at the same table – to willingly form a coalition. Israel has a parliamentary system. Every Israeli citizen above the age of 18 has the right to vote specifically for a candidate list in a single district. Once the votes are counted, the seats in the parliament are distributed accordingly. With 120 seats, the Knesset needed 61 members to agree on a government to function.
The major names on this coalition were Yair Lapid, Mansour Abbas, and Naftali Bennet.Yair Lapid is the head of his own party. After quitting a very prolific career as a TV personality, he went into politics to represent a secular and progressive, Tel Aviv-based, middle-upper class.
Mansour Abbas is a peculiar character. Head of the United Arab List (Ra’Am), he champions the interests of enough of the Arab population to have the necessary votes to be in Knesset. He runs on a platform focused on granting more resources to Arab communities in Israel, but it is hard to ignore the rumors about his old ties to the Muslim Brotherhood – the same organization behind the assassination of Anwar Sadat and the deposition of the Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi.
Finally, the most unlikely member of this threesome is current Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.Bennet, who started as a businessman strongly attached to the start-up sector, has become the face of a very religious, yet modern sector of Israeli society. After spending some time as a Likud member under the leadership of Netanyahu, he parted ways and created his own party, gaining great support from settlers in the West Bank.
The coalition made one major commitment: not to deal with any sensitive issue that will affect its continuity. This means not assessing the Palestinian problem and not tackling the settlement issue. Despite this, there are many issues the coalition is willing to work on. For example, it is expected to seriously invest in Israel’s Arab communities, improve foreign relations with the United States and Europe, and make some advancements on gender issues.
Many have pointed out the fragility of this coalition. Arguably, the smallest issue might be the cause of the fall of the government. How much will it take to sustain the government, when the issue that unites them is their hatred for Netanyahu?This assumption is more than valid, but there are also plenty of reasons to commit to this government.For Abbas, this means a huge step up the political ladder. In fact, for the first time in the history of the State of Israel, an Arab party will be a part of a government coalition. For Lapid, if the coalition were to fall apart, it would mean a loss of confidence for most of its supporters, which would probably allow Netanyahu to regain power. And for Bennett, the failure of the government would mean the end of his political career and definitive ostracism from any circle of influence.
But since every story has an end, this coalition will certainly have its own. In Israel, governments last up to four years. After this time, an election takes place to renew the entire Parliament. Furthermore, it is unusual for Israeli governments to last four years, resulting in early elections in most cases. The real question will come after the government is finished and a new election is called. Why? To begin with, the greatest taboo in Israeli politics has been broken with the participation of an Arab party in the government. This opens up many new opportunities for Arab communities and Arab-Jewish leaders. Second, the next election will show Netanyahu’s fate. Today, Netanyahu is followed closely by the shadow of corruption cases that threaten to put him in jail, as has happened to previous Prime Ministers. Most likely, the only alternative for Netanyahu to avoid prison will be regaining his immunity as Prime Minister. If Israeli society can hold a new election without allowing Netanyahu to become Prime Minister, we will certainly know that the end of an era has come.
If Israeli society can hold a new election without allowing Netanyahu to become Prime Minister, we will certainly know that the end of an era has come.
If there is something that impresses people, it is the attitude within the Likud, Netanyahu’s party. Many were predicting a complete fall from grace for the former Prime Minister and a fast internal election to renew the leadership of the party through this convoluted period. None of this has happened. Despite some announcements of Likud leaders bidding to run for party leadership, nothing has changed. In fact, Likud members of Knesset have shown a savage attitude towards any initiative from the government. Several members of parliament are trying to delegitimize and sabotage the current government. The best example of this is theCitizenship Law, approved as a temporary measure in 2003 in the middle of the Second Intifada. The law forbids Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza to acquire Israeli citizenship or residency. The law, which has been renewed every year since is now about to expire after Netanyahu called the opposition to vote against it. Netanyahu, who has been the main supporter of this law, is looking to widen the gap between the parties in the coalition, namely between Meretz[1]and Ra’am.
Likud is not comporting as a democratic opposition and instead is looking to undermine the governing coalition. For this reason, it is failing to uphold the core pillars on which the Israeli political system is built. Only the advancing of the court cases Netanyahu is facing – or the rise of new leadership – could prevent the aggravation of the current situation. That or, of course, the loss of steam of this dangerous attitude.
Despite the significant efforts the opposition is making, there is still room for change.Probably the most affected by this are the Haredim, or ultra-orthodox. With their parties out of government, the coalition lead by secular Israelis and religious nationalists, the Haredim is in a disadvantageous position. First with subsidy cuts to the Haredi population, and now with a direct confrontation with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Since the inception of the State of Israel, the Chief Rabbinate had authority over key issues in order to ensure religious support of the new State. Issues such as conversion, marriage, and kosher certification have brought controversy over the years. The recent decision to take away the monopoly on Kosher certification, a very lucrative business, from the Chief Rabbinate has eliminated a source of income for Haredi people. Besides that, the reform looks to make a series of private-run certification entities that fit different lifestyles legal. This would reduce costs for business owners and customers.
What remains a major question is Palestine.Palestinians are not represented in the Israeli government since they are not citizens. Instead, they hold their own political organizations with a limited level of autonomy under the institutions of the Palestinian National Authority.A whole article could be written on the events that shook Palestinian society during the same time.But instead, I suggest paying attention to three main issues: the relationship between Arab Israeli citizens and Palestinians, the riots against the Palestinian National Authority between June and July 2021, and the reasons behind the canceling of the election for Palestinian National Authority officials.
Israel is facing changes. It is not addressing any of the major issues the international community might care about, but the long-term consequences of this process might affect how these issues are dealt with.New leaderships for the Jewish and Arab population may represent a bright future for the State of Israel and its Arabs neighbors,especially in the context of the growing number of Arab countries recognizing Israel.

Euros 2020: England’s Loss and Ensuing Racism Show a National Symbol Caught in a Global Movement,"AfterEngland’s loss to Italy in the 2020UEFA European Football Championship(commonly referred to as ‘the Euros’),racismtowards the team’s black players ensued, raising significant questions aboutEngland’s prized national sport within the context of theBlack Lives Matter movement.
Played in London’s Wembley Stadium, the final of the Euros proved especially poignant for English fans, who had been anticipating a win for the first time since 1966. However, the team lost to Italy during penalties; three shots were missed by black players Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka. A number of fans consequently targeted these players through social media.
This targeting accompanied additionalhostility shown towards black playerswho performed symbolic actions, like taking a knee, throughout the tournament. Considering that football and the English team are widely regarded as sacred national symbols for England, the negative and racially motivated attitudes shown towards the black players on the team by a few English fans throughout the UEFA European Football Championship demonstrate the clash and lack of cohesion between a nationalized symbol and its surrounding international context, in this case,Black Lives Matter.
Cases ofracially motivatedcomments,as well as outright racism, towards England’s black players throughout the 2020 Euros took many forms. For example, the booing of players who took a knee before and after matches and over 120 instances of racist social media abuse not long after England lost to Italy. The hostility and abuse wereacknowledged by national authorities, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemning the racism and promising to ban the offenders from football matches. The London Metropolitan Police also launched an investigation into the online comments making five arrests.
pic.twitter.com/bs9lksGM4q
English playerMarcus Rashfordreleased a statement on Twitter in response to the racist abuse hurled at him. An excerpt from his statement reads:
“I will never apologize for who I am and where I come from. I’ve felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest…”.
Rashford’s response brings focus to the typified England player, who wears the symbol of the three lions on his chest. Yet, abuse against his race, based on his performance in the match suggests that he is regarded as undeserving of this label.
Racism towards England’s black players echoes a longstanding discourse aboutEnglish football as a national symbol. Elements of this symbol can still be perceived as rooted in ‘whiteness’, ‘Englishness’, and nationalistic ideals.
These nationalistic ideals focus on ‘England‘ as anidentity, and, therefore, the people who uphold this identity. These ideas also center on wanting England to dominate other nations. Black players on the team were targeted through social media for preventing a national victory and were deemedunrepresentative of England. Cleland’s (2014) study of online football message boards raises this issue of social media racism as a “presentation of whiteness and national belonging“. The abuse black players faced was quickly ascribed to their race, setting them apart as the ‘other’, from the team’s white players.
In the bigger picture, football serves as one of England’s symbols which, as Butz (2009) indicates, cultivates an attachment to the nation. Such a symbol serves as a representation of the nation’s membership, hence, some portions of English football fans have opinions as to what kind of membership their national team should have.
It is when these opinions become aligned with racist attitudes about what the English team should be that the symbol is used as a method to single out certain players over others based on their race. Attitudes of belongingness are further heightened by events like the Euros. The tournament can be categorized through Butz’s (2009) notion of a practice that infuses nationalistic sentiment, hence it becomes an event where there are especially prominent displays of “flag-waving”, which, in turn, causes “explicit psychological reactions”.
Theglobal Black Lives Matter movementremains prevalent in players’ gestures ofprotest, such as taking a knee. This mirrors the actions of other black athletes, such as American football playerColin Kaepernick, who, during games, refused to stand for the American national anthem. In their evaluation of this protest, as well as other forms of activism by African-American athletes, Mower, et al. (2018) note that this is a symbolic gesture that brought Kaepernick to BLM, which brought more attention to the movement. Such gestures can be attributed to events likehighly publicized police violenceandrace-based discrimination.
Just as Kaepernick’s actions have evoked negative reactions from spectators, who have deemed him unpatriotic and un-American, so have the actions of the English players during the Euros. The hostility of these actions has evoked a negative response to the inclusion of BLM within the football tournament, unearthing that there is a conflict between this internationally organized movement and a national phenomenon.
The keen preservation of this phenomenon suggests, as Mower et al (2018) have raised, a “possessive investment in whiteness”. This especially aligns with notions of national belongingness when considering the post-match racist social media posts and comments. Hence, black athletes who are already regarded as un-belonging are further singled out through their ‘acts of defiance’, which are assumed to threaten the phenomenon.

"The Fundamental Right to Strike: 20 Years After the G8, the Fighting Still Ensues","From July 18th– 22nd, 2001, thousands of people gathered in the narrow streets of Genova,Italy, to protest and strike against the ongoing G8 convention. Twenty years later, the legacy of this summit is characterized not by the content of the discussions of the G8 world leaders, but by the violence which ensued as young protestors and activists who had rallird from all over the world were met withbrutal repression from the Italian police. Twenty years later, we still remember thedeath of Carlo Giuliani,a 23-year-old student who, on July 20th, was shot and killed by the police during a protest. We still remember theraid against the Diaz School, where protestors were assaulted while taking shelter. We still remember, with vivid imagery, the total disregard on behalf of the Italian police force for the fundamental right to strike and protest. What started as a structured movement against the extremes of globalization, turned the G8 of Genova into a testament of the systematic violation of the right to strike. That which is annoverated as a foundamental freedom, is in reality often derogated from given its contentious nature.
Therefore, it becomes fundamental to investigate theinternational recognition and function of the right to strikein order to understand its critical role  in both labour law and human rights law, as well as analyze how the erosion of the right to strike influences other social issues that characterize our times.
What Was the Reason Behind the G8 Protests?
The 2001 Convention, during which the Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi welcomed the likes of George W. Bush, Tony Blair,Vladimir Putin, and the other G8 leaders in Genova, was intended to entrench the political and economic vision of a  new globalization which had started in the late 90s. As neoliberal globalization was at the peak of its hegemony in the early 2000s, global citizens were living under the false promise that this system of globalized capitalism would have closed the global inequality gap, instead of furthering it to what it is today.
However, not everyone seemed to agree with this view. Certainly, the thousands of protestors gathered in Genova did not. Since the 1990s, there had been a plethora of debates on how to approach the “global era” and what it could entail. Indeed, many were concerned about the impact that globalization would have and they were there to voice their dissatisfaction with this new world order.
In Genova, students and scholars, workers and migrants, were all gathered to strike against mass deforestation, the growing issue of climate change, a world where 20% of the population held 80% of the wealth, and a system that appeared to foster inequality. On July 20th, 2001, all of the protesters were united under the slogan “a new world is possible”, and they were ready to take action to show that. However, at that time, any talk of breaking from globalization appeared to many as an unrealistic, if not an outright dystopian, prospect.
Today, 20 years later, the premise could not be more different. After years of extremes, economic downturns, and capital-induced recessions, the idea that a globalized economy leads to collective prosperity has all but faded. By 2010,the Economist had highlighted how the “steam” of the train of globalization had run out. The trend of international trade decreasing continued until it fell by a staggering 7% during the Covid-19 Pandemic. This crisis highlights the fragility and inequality deeply rooted in a globalized system that promised equality while socio-economic barriers were being created around the world. Hence, this goes to show how the G8 movements are extremely relevant today and should draw our attention to the institutional responses with which these movements have been met.
In Genova, the fundamental right to strike was severely violated, as was the case with the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and the Friday for Future movement. In what appears to be a cyclical disregard for how crucial it is to ensure respect for the right to protest, a fundamental human right, as we look back at the events in Genova it is essential to understand why the right to strike should be obliged.
The International Recognition of the Right to Strike
The relation between labour laws and human rights is an extremely interesting phenomenon, with the first being majorly influenced by the rise of human rights discourse, in particular, due to the fact that the right to strike is a widely debated topic.
At the legislative level, the right to strike has been enshrined in a multitude of international bodies, such as theILO Convention No. 87(articles 3, 8, and 10), theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights(article 8), theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(article 22), theEuropean Convention on Human Rights (article 11), and theAmerican Convention on Human Rights (article 16), as well as being recognized in the constitutions of at least 90 countries. Nonetheless, although its recognition at the international level is solid, the right to strike has been repeatedly violated over the years, making it fundamental to reiterate why such a right should not be obstructed.
In general, workers’ rights are codified as human rights to the extent that they protect individuals from exploitation and servitude, and guarantee fairness and respect in the workplace. Therefore, the right to strike plays a pivotal role in this process, as giving workers the possibility to unite and manifest their discontent is the core of the democratic and social bargaining that allows for an equitable workplace. This then spills over into other sorts of gatherings and protests, such as student movements or political action, which are meant to practice social bargaining. In this regard,Mr. Maina Kiai, Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Assembly, writes,
“The right to strike is also an intrinsic corollary of the fundamental right of freedom of association. It is crucial for millions of women and men around the world to assert collectively their rights, including the right to just and favorable conditions of work, and to work and live in dignity and without fear of intimidation and persecution”.
Hence, to strike is not limited to workers, but to all of those who are dissatisfied with their current situation and are determined to take action to bring about change by making their voices heard and their demands clear.
Thus, the international recognition of the right to strike appears to be the culmination of all the efforts that began in the midst of the Industrial Revolution and were carried out for the last two centuries to achieve equitable wages, sustainable working hours, and the surpassing of racial and gender discrimination in the workplace. These achievements have influenced other protest movements from the Civil Rights Movement to student protests in Genova. However, even though this achievement deserves recognition, the reality of the influence of the right to strike tells us quite a different story.A study conducted by Eldira Xhafa and the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in 2016 showshow, both at the national and international level, the fundamental right to strike is repeatedly violated. In particular, the survey,
“Shows that most (23 countries) of the 35 countries which are OECD members have enacted legal provisions and/or case-law rulings and/or have adopted practices which restrict the right to strike above and beyond established international standards”.
These violations encompass the exclusion of certain groups of workers from the right to strike, prohibition/restriction on strikes, excessive sanctions on legitimate strikes, and, as in the case of Genova, the violent repression of strikes and gatherings. Hence, it appears that the right to strike, although solidly established and recognised at the international level, is often defied when actually put into practice.
As such, the right to strike is a very particular type of human right as it is subject to many limitations. These limitations occur when a governing body fails to properly adhere to and respect such a fundamental feature of workers’ rights, and constitute a major disrespect of the validity of these movements. As Xhafa writes,
“The erosion of the right to strike represents a major setback for the labor movement, further weakening it and the means to challenge rising inequality and other economic and social problems. In times of concerted attack on workers’ rights, including the right to strike, the vision of ›economic democracy‹ has become a distant utopia”.
Therefore, we can notice how the right to strike does not represent only a fundamental resource for workers, but it is also a social power utilised to manifest the demand for equity and respect.
The act of striking is a political tool to demand and protect other fundamental human rights; an act meant to send a clear message of dissatisfaction that is difficult to ignore. This, of course, has often led to strikes becoming violent acts, which have sometimes discredited their validity in the face of the law.  However, perhaps if it were not for these powerful, and sometimes not completely peaceful, actions, our society would have not reached some of the milestones it has. Therefore, it is important to contextualize and understand labour rights and, in this case, the right to strike as a wider struggle for a democratization of both the workplace and in the act of social bargaining.
Thus, to strike is not necessarily to wreak havoc; it means establishing a dialogue when nobody bothers to listen to you. In the words of Frederick Douglas, a pioneer of the labor movement, “Power concedes nothing without demand”.

Cuban Protests: Coercion and Revolution for Export,"Since 1991,Cubahas suffered economic and political unrest due to the fall of the Soviet Union and the consequent lack of Communist aid. During the ’90s, the Cuban government andFidel Castrohimself referred to the post-Soviet era as a “special period”. In fact, Cubans remember this time as a period of hunger and repression.
The socialist island was able to ease economic tensions for a few years during its alliance withVenezuelanpresident Hugo Chavez. In 2000, the two leaders signed an agreement of cooperation that involved the economic integration of both countries. The Cubans contributed to the Venezuelan economy with technology and services to “support the economic and social program for the development of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela” in exchange for a daily shipment of53,000 barrels of crude oil a day. Even today, the island receives subsidized oil barrels despite the economic disaster caused by the Maduro regime.
The oil was resold by Castro’s regime to gain hard currency; however, the island’s situation has become more difficult in recent years, due to the economic crisis in Venezuela, the drop in the oil prices, and theCovid-19 pandemicthat killed tourism, a big source of income for the island.
“Movimiento San Isidro”, born from artists and human rights activists in favor of the change, has been significantly impacted due to recent internet access, despite the government’s shutdown, which allows the world to see some of the abuses of the dictatorship, a compelling difference with the “Maleconazo” movement in 1994.
Further, the civil society that rose against Cuban autocracy has a stronger identity than ever. The song “Patria y Vida” (Motherland and life) and the movement’s name “Movimiento San Isidro” have given the anti-regime protesters a slogan and an anthem that helped put their movement on the map.
In a recentinterview, Steven Levitsky talked about regimes that are born from social movements, as is the case in Cuba, and their long-term stability. One of the reasons this Harvard professor identifies is that in this kind of revolution there is a total collapse of the ancient regime, for instance, the church, former military, and pre-existing political parties. Subsequently, a revolutionary army is created through theindoctrination of the new leadership. This tends to reduce the chances of military uprisings, and, in the long term, can result in a total fusion between the political elite and the armed forces.
The ambiguity over the monopoly of power and violence has been exploited by Castro and his commanders in several instances to assure the obedience of his army, which has never rebelled against the revolution, allowing the Cuban politburo to buy some long-term stability.
Another ticket for autocratic stability is the consolidation of a powerful, coercive system. The organizations controlled by the new elites made the Cuban regime immune to military coups. The fearsome apparatus created by the Cubans was known as the G2, created in the early ’60s by former Interior Minister Ramiro Valdez Menendez, with advisors from the Czech intelligence, the consent of Anastás Mikoyán and Raul Castro, and the supervision of the KGB.
The G2’s have also beenexported to counsel the Maduro regime, to help wipe away the opposition and the unsubmissive media, and ultimately build an authoritarian regime. Ramiro Valdez was named advisor of an energy commission in 2010 by President Hugo Chavez himself. The former Minister was the face of a large number of Cubans who joined the public administration of Venezuela during this period.
The once prosperous Venezuelan democracy, ruled by a bipartisan regime, became a battleground between a republic that has not passed away and an autocracy that has not yet been born. As Gramsci once said, it is “the time of monsters”.
Mr. Valdezis one of the historic leaders of the revolution. He enlisted with Castro in the Moncada insurrection when he was 22 and followed Castro’s to imprisonment and exile. After the triumph of the revolution, he was sent as the second commander of the“La Cabaña”military fortress, a place that is well known for being chosen for the execution of the former Batista army and police forces.
In 1960, he was a key member of the Cuban delegation that received training in military intelligence in Czechoslovakia, his fearsome reputation in this field gave him the alias “Charco de Sangre” (pool of blood).
“Valdés has governed Cuba with repression and a rifle under his arm, that’s the only purpose he has. He never managed engineering matters,” said Enrique Márquez, spokesman for the opposition party “Un Nuevo Tiempo” in anarticleto “El Mundo” journal.
However, giving some hope to change,Levitskyassures that when the revolutionary generation disappears, the dictatorship needs to find alternative bases for stability. For instance, in the cases of Vietnam and China, the solution was industrial economic growth. However, the latter did not work in Cuba, despite loosening private property control and advances from the Chavez alliance.
The Cuban Revolution created a society that, between the ’70s and late ’80s, was socially integrated thanks to the help of Sovietaid, despite the fact that dissensus was eliminated with repression. From the ’90s onwards, coercion and ideology were the only recipes the revolution could offer to build political stability.
President Canel faces the challenge of choosing whether to open Cuba to the global markets as the rest of the Communist dictatorships did. This would buy stability for the political branch, with the cost of inner resistance from the Cuban politburo, as Deng Xiaoping suffered in his time. The risk of not addressing reforms would expose the regime to more years of political tension and repression.

Countercultures of Overworking: Socio-Economic Implications of 21st Century Burnout,"By common definition,burnoutis a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress.
The grueling demands of modern society are not new and, unsurprisingly,international studieshave proven that global work culture is causing burnout, even to the point of death. In the wake of Covid-19 and the additional stress it has placed on workers in every field, it is not surprising to observe a growing resistance to unhealthy workplaces, especially among young people.
Counterculture movements expressing disillusionment with societal structures have been important aspects of nearly every political landscape for centuries. For example, in the realm of European philosophical approaches, movements like Existentialism, dating back to the 19th century, expressed disenchantment with the status quo and focused on the value of the individual over the collective.
Two examples of young people standing in opposition to “traditional” post-industrial expectations of young workers – such as finding a “stable” job with a good income, buying property, and starting a nuclear family unit via marriage and childbirth – are“Tang Ping”(or“Lying Flat”) in China and“I Do Not Dream of Labor”, which is based mostly in the West but has global influence. While the former has the potential to be a revolutionary movement, the latter can be understood as a trend that lacks actionable next steps.
In China, there is statistical evidence that workers from nearly every industry, fromteacherstodoctors, are experiencing burnout at staggering levels. At Peking University, one of the top universities in the country, a study found that40% of freshmenthought that life was pointless. In a country where your marks in school determine your job but cannot guarantee employment, this sentiment is not unfounded, especially this year whenonly 25% of recent graduateswere able to find work due to the pandemic. General youth unemployment in China isaround 14%which demonstrates that there is a significant issue. Add the fact thaturban housing priceshave risen far beyond wages and the idea of even barely getting by becomes unfeasible for the majority of Chinese youth.
From the intensified disenchantment created by the pandemic came “Tang Ping“, orthe “Lying Flat” Movement, which began in April 2021 after a viral post was written on Baidu; one of the largest internet companies in the world, which hosts a major search engine and online forum for the Chinese population. The post’s author, whose identity is still unknown to the general public,wrote, “I can be like Diogenes, who sleeps in his own barrel taking in the sun” and detailed how two years of unemployment led him to reject societal expectations and ambitions, choosing instead to work small jobs to make just enough money to survive, and nothing more.
The post gained serious traction by May, and the idea that“Lying Flat is Justice”became a formidable online movement. So formidable, in fact, that it posed a threat to the Chinese government. Afour-page commentaryinNanfang Daily, a newspaper known to be the CCP-run government’s mouthpiece, stated: “In the face of pressure, choosing to ‘lie flat’ is not only unjust but shameful.” This reaction shows that “lying flat” is not trivial to the government, and it poses a direct threat to Xi Jinping’s “National Rejuvenation” goals of doubling per capita GDP between 2010 and 2021 and reaching a state of full development by IMF standards.
Several other state-run media sites quickly followed suitin criticizing the movement as a threat to the nation. The backlash was not limited just to media sites; the search function for “lying flat” was banned on WeChat, discussion forums about “lying flat” on Douban were disabled, and t-shirts associated with “lying flat” were banned from Alibaba-owned Taobao.
In a country where the prevalence of“wolf culture”,where one must “kill or be killed” and “996” (working from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm 6 days a week), is considered normal, “lying flat” embodies the cost of “killing” a nation’s employees. Attempts to rebel against “wolf culture” are not new in China. As recently as 2019, tech workers utilized GitHub to form the“996.ICU”Movement; a play on words that implied that the 996 culture sent its workers to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Unlike “lying flat”, the movement was not shut down by the government, but rather by the tech industry itself, which quickly shrugged it off. Jack Ma, CEO of Alibaba, went as far as to call 996 culture a“huge blessing”.
But in the midst ofa looming debt crisisthat could disproportionately impact young people hoping to take out a student loan or use credit to pay their bills, “lying flat” seems to be the only formidable alternative to trying to live up to societal expectations. In a country where physical protests are swiftly suppressed, online movements are much more difficult to control. Any attempts to suppress them can be interpreted as a sign of their strength rather than an indication of failure. Moreover, if a significant number of Chinese youth actually chose to “lie down” instead of work, there could be aserious chance for political upheaval, or even a revolution.
China is not the only place where online counterculture has formed in the wake of burnout. One example is the“I Do Not Dream of Labor” Movementtaking place predominantly on social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter. Led by the “influencer” crowd – mostly comprised of upper-middle-class youth – this movement proposes many of the same ideas that “lying flat” does; namely, that career aspirations should not be central to one’s life.
A “dream job”, the trend shows, is unrealistic because no one actually dreams of engaging in labor, and instead prefers to enjoy their life through leisure. The idealization of labor, especially in Western countries like the United States, can be attributed to the modern neoliberal economic system that is built upon the idea that paying your dues to society will directly benefit one’s happiness. However, “I Do Not Dream of Labor” indicates that this idea no longer motivates younger generations, who widely believe that even with hard work,their lives are unlikely to be more prosperous than their parents’ lives.
It is important to remember that this trend is led by “influencers”, who often make a significant income from their social media platforms, often attained through ads for the same major companies they critique. While an influencer can use their channel to reject the idea of a non-specific “capitalist system”, all of the leaders of this movement self-identify as “privileged” and, though their intentions may be good, have utilized that same “capitalist” (specifically neoliberal) system they live within to their own benefit. In fact, many of those same influencers support the idea thateveryone can make money off of YouTubeand lateroutsource the tasks they find dull to other people.
The idea that you can “fight capitalism with capitalism” through YouTube and then practice “altruistic outsourcing” is essentially a reworking of thetrickle-down economic policieswhich most notably manifested in “Reaganomics” in the US during the 1980s. The idea that providing tax breaks to businesses will “trickle-down” to the consumer because it will allow the business to grow and therefore hire more employees and increase wages, failed to produce long-term growth in the economy. In fact, empirical evidence has shown that tax breaks for big corporations onlyexacerbate wealth gaps.
For this reason, “I Do Not Dream of Labor” does not propose a real solution to the problems the leaders of the trend point out, which is exactly what makes ita trend and not a movement. Until the leaders and followers of this trend can find a real, actionable solution that does not merely reproduce the problem in a different way, this idea will not have a real impact on the economy or political system the members live in.
In this way, the “I Do Not Dream of Labor” Movement is far less formidable than the “Lying Flat” Movement in its hopes to evoke structural change. That being said, the “I Do Not Dream of Labor” Movement represents a broader sense of disillusionment and disenchantment with labor or employment in general and can be considered an indicator of burnout in the 21st-century, which has already had a very real impact on the global economy.
Both of these movements indicate a significant shift in the way employees approach work, the consequences of which have already manifested in the economy. Economists are calling 2021“The Great Resignation”due to the number of workers who have quit their jobs in the midst of the ongoing pandemic.A Microsoft studyof more than 30,000 workers worldwide indicated that as many as 41% were considering quitting or changing jobs this year.
For many people, changing jobs or quitting altogether was centered on the ways they felt mistreated, undervalued, or overworked by their employerduring the pandemic.A Stanford Business studyshows that companies who were already treating workers badly before the pandemic were less financially flexible and more likely to engage with activities that hurt their employees; such as laying off large numbers of workers.
The Great Resignation, much like “lying flat”, is manifesting itself in every socio-economic group. In April 2021,650,000 retail workers quit their jobs, citing that “their lives weren’t worth a dead-end job”, and some studies place this number even higher at740,000.
Where “lying flat” has many obvious political implications, like the possibility for social unrest and making feasible strides towards change, trends towards rethinking work in the West show less revolutionary thinking and more petitioning for peaceful changes.
More and more companies are realizing that offering remote work is one way to attract workers back into the economy. For jobs that are able to be done remotely,the number of remote listings on LinkedIn tripled in 2021in Australia alone. However, for jobs that cannot be done remotely, the mass exodus of workers is forcing businesses that previously offered minimum wage payments to considerincreasing their wages and offering benefits.
If businesses can adapt to workers’ needs, there is no indication that a broader political movement would take place. However, it is clear that workers are willing to risk everything, including their source of income, to live a life that is not controlled by their workplace. Therefore, it is up to both political and business leaders to react in a way that satisfies workers’ demands, because not doing so risks systemic collapse, lost generations, and social upheaval.

Flooding and Fibbing: The Absence of Climate Change Effort from Developed Countries,"In the wake of recent flooding in Europe, the death toll has catastrophically andtragically reached 180 after floods tore through Western Germany and Belgiumin mid-July 2021. Scientists have demonstrably attributed the unimaginable severity of the recent flooding to climate change, and politicians appear to agree. The Interior Minister of Germany, Horst Seehofer, said the country“must prepare much better”, adding that“this is a consequence of climate change”. Both argue that the extreme weather cannot be attributed to any usual hot, wet summer, considering the24-hour rainfall at Cologne’s Stammheim stationon Wednesday of 155mm (6.1in), which smashed the city’s previous daily rainfall high of 95mm, and the fact that theseven hottest-recorded years have occurred since 2014. As Jonathan Watts stated in the Guardian:“These numbers are outside worst-case scenarios”.
In an interview following the flood in Arloff, Germany, one victim was quoted crying:“You don’t expect people to die in a flood in Germany”. She continued,“You expect it maybe in poor countries, but you don’t expect it here”. Though clearly traumatized, this person’s idea of the location of climate change, unfortunately, echoes the voices of much of European governance. Climate change issystematically placed and scapegoated on ‘poor’ countries. An argument against this would suggest you might expect a more capable response to climate disasters, embedded in infrastructure, in developed countries, or expect fewer disasters due to the milder climate of many European countries. However, following the floods in Germany, the Greens Candidate for Chancellor admitted “ambitious climate protection” measures to be the last of the three steps required to address the situation. Centralizing the country’s disaster management system and adjusting the design of German cities and waterways to prepare for future floods, she insisted, were of “equal importance”. Due to the increase in severe flooding, not just in Germany and Belgium, but also in the Netherlands and England (where in London themonthly average rainfall fell in 24 hourson the 12thJuly 2021),infrastructure continues to be unprepared, responses fail to save lives and property, and the title of ‘mild weather’ loses its veracity.
This article will focus primarily on the EU, Schengen countries, and the UK’s climate responsibility, in comparison to the rest of the world. According to the above chart, Germany, Poland, Italy, France, and the UK make up a collective 6% of total global CO2 emissions, whilst making up 4.05% of the world’s population. In comparison, developing countries are responsible for 63% of total global emissions, whilst making up 80% of the world’s population. As well as considering these empirical imbalances in global emissions compared to population share, this article would also like to draw attention to the widely debated scholarship on climate responsibility. There are undeniable historical imbalances when we consider the formation of the Anthropocene. Due to European colonialism, the innovation and progress that the Industrial Revolution brought to many European nations were obstructed from ex-colonies in the name of European development, and these now make up the vast majority of developing countries. The development of green technologies is a long way away from those who“lack access to a steady, clean electricity supply and instead use high-emission diesel generators to generate electricity”.
Despite its scholarly importance, this article believes climate progress will not be made by the individual, but by addressing the real issue:the 20 firms behind a third of all global emissions. Twelve of these firms are state-owned by nations outside of Europe, however, the following firms are owned by European investors:
These 20 firms have contributed to an inconceivable amount of emissions (35% or 480 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane since 1965) and these three firms, allentirely European-owned, have contributed 78.3 billion tonnes, approximately 5.7% of total global emissions since 1965, from countries that make up 1.93% of the world’s population.
In light of this, we look at the recent climate promises made by the G7 in Cornwall, 2021. [The G7 includes the nations of the UK, Germany, France, Italy, the US, China, and Canada, as well as a representative from the EU, President Ursula von der Leyen; the group makes up60% of global net wealth].
The $100 billion pledge makes up a total of 0.03% of the total wealth of the G7 nations, and according to Caroline Lucas, Leader of the English Green Party, the nations which were promised this amount“have been waiting for richer nations to deliver on [the] pledgemade more than 10 years agoof $100 billion a year in climate finance.”Furthermore, according to Teresa Anderson of Action Aid, the little financial support provided so far to developing countries “has beenin the form of loans, which are pushing vulnerable countries further into debt and poverty.”
This promise falls flat in consideration of the empirical and socio-political imbalances already stated in this article, which would arguedeveloped countries use more non-renewable energy per person than developing countries do.
Furthermore, we can consider the other top 20 firms that are owned by non-European G7 leaders. The graph below shows that an enormous amount of the total percentage of global emissions since 1965 are produced within the G7, a fact that puts a significant proportion of responsibility on the nations of the G7 to control their own citizens first and foremost.Whether these nations are completely submissive to the investors they are meant to govern, or they are instead in some way benefiting from the continuation of these firms’ rampant emissions production, is a question yet to be answered.
Further promises included:
[G7 promises source:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-57461670]
Anderson was disappointed with the G7’s green promises stating,“The G7’s reaffirmation of the previous $100 billion a year target doesn’t come close to addressingthe urgency and scale of the crisis.”It is difficult to not fall under the doom and gloom statistics that seem to increasingly warn us that we are missing our opportunity to reverse climate change, or that we have long missed it altogether. However, it is clear that there is a real need for pressure on European and other developed governments to offer far more substantial action, whether this means addressing the 20 firms who have produced more emissions than any individual country, or improving infrastructure to deal with the inevitable increase in extreme temperatures, flooding, and disaster as we are expecting with current trends.

The Rise of Eco-Terrorism in Latin America,"The fight to mitigatethe effects of climate changehas been ongoing for decades. In response to government inaction, non-violent movements of civil activism have arisen, and recently, so have organizations with more violent and radical agendas.
The termeco-terrorismhas been misused multiple times by mass media to describeecotage. The latter constitutes acts of civil disobedience such as sabotage, arson, or trespassing for ecological reasons. On the contrary, ecoterrorism, like any type ofterrorism, is defined as the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims, in this case, in defense of the environment.
Researchersestimatedthat Radical Environmentalist and Animal Rights (REAR) cells can be found in at least 25 countries and were responsible for more than 1,000 criminal acts between 1970 and 2007 in the United States alone.InLatin Americathe presence of REAR groups can be traced back to 2011, when scientists from the Monterrey Institute of Technology in Mexico City received a package bomb that exploded, injuring a robotics researcher. This attack was the first of many in the country, which mostly targeted bio and nanotechnologists.
The group that claimed the assaults wereIndividualistas Tendiendo a lo Salvaje-roughly translated to Individuals Tending to Savagery- or ITS, through amanifestoposted on the anarchist blog Total Liberation. They self-identify aseco-extremistsand accuse technological progress of being the main cause of environmental issues. The closing lines of the manifesto state:
“We act without compassion in defense of nature. Did those that alter and destroy the Earth think that their actions had no consequences? That they didn’t have to pay a price? If they thought that, they thought wrong”.
Since then, a rise in threats and attacks has been registered in various Latin American countries. In2017, an explosive package was delivered to the home of Óscar Landerretche, president of Coldeco, Chilean Copper Corporation. The explosion left him with injuries on his arm, forearm, and abdomen. Two years later,Camilo Gajardowas arrested and accused of being linked to ITS and named responsible for this and other attacks. The prosecutors sought a 170 years sentence and he currently awaits trial in prison. In 2018, Brasilian ministers Damares Alves – Women, Family, and Human Rights- and Ricardo Salles -Environment- received multiple death threats from REAR group Wilderness Secret Society.
InMarch 2019, in an explosion near a bus stop in Chile’s capital Santiago, five people were injured and no deaths were reported. Weeks later, ITS released a statement taking responsibility for the attack. Although Chilean authorities made no comments about ITS involvement, they opened an investigation labeled as terrorism.In the same year, during the International Congress on Transnational Crime held in Buenos A res, the head of the Anti-Terrorism Directorate of the Buenos Aires City Police, Alejandro Cassaglia, acknowledged the existence of ecoterrorist groups in the region without giving further details on their whereabouts.
The air of secrecy and misinformation that surrounds ITS can raise questions about their actual size and international presence. Often, they take credit for attacks that were later proven not to be executed by them. Nonetheless, they keep pushing a narrative that not only positions them as perpetrators but underlines an intention to be perceived as a factor of societal instability.
In this context, Latin American governments do not seem to have a strategy when it comes to tackling ecoterrorism in the long run. Countless attacks were registered in the last couple of years, yet very few people were arrested, let alone convicted, and there appears to be a tendency to deal with them after the fact. Meanwhile, not much is being done in terms of intelligence and preventative measures.
As with any social phenomenon, the causes leading to an increase in ecoterrorist attacks vary. A sense of hopelessness and frustration with government inaction can spawn radical views to arise within ecoactivists. At the same time, groups with other political views could be using the current relevance of green politics as a facade to attract and radicalize new people.
Either way, these attacks – although not necessarily linked – are the signs of a rising movement. Governments must be careful about how to approach the situation. The importance of preserving democratic values and the safety of its citizens must not come as a detriment to the reputation of the environmental movement, nor the right to protest.

25 Years After a Conflict: Helping the Youth in Bosnia,"Dubioza Kolektiv, a popular Bosnian avant-garde group would say – or rather, sing – that Bosnia-Herzegovina is in Europe “just in Eurosong“. According to them, the country is only welcome as a full-fledged member of Europe when it benefits the image of a multicultural, welcoming continent, but when the lights of Eurovision go off, Bosnia disappears from public discourse. If anything, it may come up in conversations simply as the place where “there once was a war”.
In part, this is understandable. How is it possible that a European country could be majority Muslim? Why does it stubbornly refuse to behave like a “normal” democracy? And yet, since February 2016, Bosnia-Herzegovina has been acandidatefor accession to the EU. In 2010, the country joined the NATOMembership Action Plan. Therefore, no matter how divided or unstable, Bosnia is clearly a member of the wobbly, colorful European family.
Bosnian youth are also, by extension, a part of the European youth. Their dreams, aspirations, and difficulties are not so different from those of young people born on the other side of the Adriatic. Their starting ground, however, is not the same. Their social, economic, and political context is complex and hard to navigate. Even 25 years after the conflict in Yugoslavia, Bosnia still has a long way to go.
This article will investigate the role of NGOs in confronting the shortcomings of the political and educational system in Bosnia. It will do so through the words ofZorana Selak, Project Manager of theNGO “Most”[The Bridge], based in Gradiška, Bosnia. This interview will help to shed some light on the benefits of informal education. Can local organizations help overcome ethnic divisions and gaps in formal education?
The interview took place in the town of Gradiška, situated in the Banja Luka district of Republika Srpska.Many of its inhabitants would describe it as beingBogu iza noga[behind the legs of God], which roughly translates to “in the middle of nowhere”. One might think that there is not much worth investigating. The joyful appearance of this town resonates well with its motto: “Nothing much happened here“. However, not only does the town have a very peculiar history, but it is also the blooming cultural center of Bosnia.
The area surrounding this town was of strategic importance as early as the Roman era. In fact, the municipality was built on the precise location where the Sava river used to be crossed. The town was identified for the first time asGradiški Brodin 1330 A.C. In 1537, the town came under Ottoman rule and was renamedBerbir.
Even during the most recent war, Gradiška did not lose its centrality.Here, wartime began almost a year before the “official” beginning of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on April 6, 1992. As early as May 1991, the town was implicated in the escalation of hostilities in Western Slavonia. As the Croatian forces and the Yugoslav People’s Army prepared to confront each other, Gradiška developed into a strategic outpost.
Its geographic location made it the ideal place for organizing the military activities of the Yugoslav/Serb forces. The downside was that from September 1991, its proximity to the frontline exposed the town to Croatian airstrikes. By December, Gradiška appeared on the front page of the Serb newspaperGlas Srpskeas “the most endangered town in [Bosnia-Herzegovina]”.
Being on the frontline throughout the 10-year war was not inconsequential. As a result,in Gradiška there are now two different communities of war refugees.The first group is constituted by the Serbian population that left Western Slavonia during the first phase of the conflict. The second is the group of people – predominantly ethnic Serbs – who relocated to Gradiška from Southern Bosnia. Many came from Donji Vakuf after the town fell to the Bosnian and Croat armies in the summer of 1995.
The massive influx of refugees caused changes in the ethnic landscape of Gradiška. In 1971 Bošniaks (Bosnian Muslims) accounted for 56% of the population, whereas the Serb presence amounted to 30%. As of 2013, the town’s population of 51,000 is made up of 77% Serbs, and only 17% Bošniaks. Understandably, the traumatic experience of war gave way to personal grievances and political acrimony. But how does this translate into the lives of young people in Bosnia today?
To gain some insight, TNGO interviewed Zorana Selak, a 26-year-old Project Manager at the NGO “Most”. The first question was how a young woman such as herself decided to pursue such a career path. In the Balkans, in general, and in Republika Srpska in particular, NGOs encounter a certain suspicion. For many, their international breadth implies unwelcome foreign meddling into the regions’ affairs.
She proudly recognized that her choice was somewhat unusual, stating that: “As for myself, I am kind of ambitious. But the school that I went to was pretty… realistic. Once finishing school I told myself: “Ok, I’m going to work in a company, do some accounting or something and just be a regular worker. And then I saw that that’s not enough for me. I want something else. I want to be useful, I want to help somebody, I want to be more active. And then I saw that Association Most had a very beautiful project at that moment.“
“That’s not enough for me. I want something else. I want to be useful, I want to help somebody, I want to be more active. And then I saw that Association Most had a very beautiful project at the moment.”
Selak then volunteered at the Daily Nest Centre for children at risk for a year and a half. When the opportunity arose to become more involved, she did not hesitate to say yes. Through the association, she was able to further her education and gain more responsibilities. Gradually, she started managing her own projects. The most impactful experience she had was not only getting to know people and their difficulties, but also seeing the effects of the NGO’s projects on their lives.
But how did NGO “Most” come to be? The association was born in 2008 and formally registered in 2009. The founders were three close friends striving to gain funds for their youth-oriented projects. Their initial purpose was to help young people from around the country travel, in particular for Erasmus+ youth exchanges, regarding which, Zorana added: “But then it got kind of bigger, we didn’t stop at just those exchanges. Instead, we spread our activities to three main fields: support for the local youth, social entrepreneurship, and environmental protection.“
“But then it got kind of bigger, we didn’t just stop at those exchanges. Instead, we spread our activities to three main fields: support for the local youth, social entrepreneurship and environmental protection.”
In 2010, the local government offered “Most” an old building which had been turned into an office space. And, after a lot of hard work, the place was finally ready for inauguration. Currently, “the youth center is now 12 years from its formal foundation. We receive a lot of positive comments.We are very recognized in the community for our very good work with young people, especially in the field of informal education.“
The association also acts as the headquarters for the local volunteering service. That means that all its partner organizations and institutions that need volunteers can contact the organization to help them out. Of course, this guarantees that “Most” remains integrated into a network of national and international associations. This is important not only because the volunteers that lend their service have an opportunity to network with international organizations, but also because they get a “Passport of the Volunteer”. That is, a document that registers their activities and the skills developed, that they can use for future employment.
“Most” is also active in the field of social entrepreneurship. “We have our very own start-up, or small business if you want:Funky Guerrilla, under the FG Group. It produces and sells clothing as a social entrepreneurs company. 50% of the profit that is made by the company goes back to the company. The other 50% goes into financing the activities that we have, including Environmental Protection.“
In fact, “Most” pays close attention to keeping the environment as healthy as possible, a valuable effort ina country that still relies on coal for 45% of its needs. Activities span from protecting certain animal species to school programs and concrete cleaning actions.
When it comes to Bosnia, party politics are very different from that of Western countries. In Western Europe, party politics often appear to be far away from everyday people. People may have their preferences, but generally do not perceive politics to be an active presence in their lives. In Bosnia, however, party politics are pervasive. It is not unusual to see political personalities attending social and cultural events that, apparently, have nothing to do with politics.
The ubiquity of politics goes hand in hand with high levels ofcorruption. Frequently,people affiliate with a party just to get a job, or a better contract. It is not even necessary to be genuinely in line with the political beliefs of the party. What matters, apparently, is the outward expression of allegiance.
This “my way or the highway” attitude often encounters forms of resistance. Last month, the YouTuber Amir Hadžić launched a petition to arrest Milorad Dodik [the representative of Serbs in the Bosnian Presidency] for his alleged corruption. Yet, these sporadic actions cannot, alone, eradicate a system that is sewn into the political fabric of Bosnia.
Considering the situation, can NGOs still enjoy the freedom of action?With regards to this, Zorana answered that:“Well, the Bosnian system has a lot of obstacles. But on the local level, we had, from the beginning,pretty good cooperation with our local government.They supported us on any kind of actions in the first few years. Then, they saw what kind of activities we do, what kind of results we give, and they were good results.“
“They said: Every activity that you do, if you need some kind of permission or anything, please just tell us. We’re going to help you. Of course, that doesn’t mean that they financially support us. We aren’t financed by Republika Srpska. The office space that we use belongs to the city, and we receive a small amount for local volunteering services. But most of our funds come frominternational organizationsand international projects.”
“But still, it’s very nice to see that you are recognized in the local community as an association that does really good things that help others. And it’s also very nice when the government is not saying: ‘Ok, you cannot do this and that’. They are always like: “You have our full support and any kind of projects that you implement, count us in”.Therefore, it would appear that NGOs enjoyrelative freedom and space for maneuvering. In this way, they can provide services such as informal education or other training that young people could not otherwise access.
Bosnian youth, in fact, are a particularly fragile demographic even today. They are most affected by the precarious economic conditions of the country, even 25 years after the conflict, which leads to an unstoppable flow of emigration. The latestOECD figuresshow that since 2018, 44,700 people have left the country, going mostly to Germany, Slovenia, and Austria. The emigrants from 2013 and 2018 are estimated to be between 150,000 and 500,000 people. That would represent 15% of the entire population of a country of only 3.5 million inhabitants. The Western Balkans Democracy Initiative calculated thatBosnia is losing about €21,000 per person that leaves the country.
NGO “Most”, together with other similar organizations, is trying to counteract this trend.According to Zorana: “Being a volunteer is an amazing job, it’s a job that we all have to do. But then, if you don’t offer the volunteers something that is interesting for them, something that they need, something from what they can learn and gain new knowledge from, they eventually get lost, go somewhere else“. In particular, the association tries to focus on teaching young people useful hard and soft skills. The hope is, of course, that this can help them find a job.
“There is a bit of a situation in the Bosnian system, in the sense that it’s not very empowering for you. Young people don’t know how to get their own small companies starting. So we did a lot of education about how to create your own business, how to run a small company.”
“There is a bit of a situation in the Bosniansystem, in the sense that it’s not very empowering for you. Young people don’t know how to get their own small companies starting. So we did a lot of education about how to create your own business, how to run a small company. We provided a lot of education that I hope served to make them feel pushed to get into the field. We just hope to help them out with all the resources that we have in here.” Furthermore, “Most” also has to run its own company. About that, she added: “I sincerely hope that we will also make new workplaces.”
To make things even more difficult, the school system also has its shortcomings. This problem is not exclusive to Bosnia; on the contrary, thegap between education and workaffects even developed countries. The effect is that: “The education that young people get in high school is often not enough. They don’t have enough social, linguistic, IT, and other work-related skills. In such a state of things, we paid a lot of attention to informal education. All the projects that we did were based on empowering the youth and underlining the possibilities of informal education. The objective was to help them get the skills that they need for University or employment.“
“The education that young people get in high school is often not enough. […] All the projects that we did were based on empowering the youth and underlining the possibilities of non-formal education.
In other words, NGOs try to figure out what people need and deliver tailored projects. At the same, it is important to let volunteers bond and form connections. “We put a lot of effort intoorganizing different things for them to gather here, to hang out. That’s the thing, the informal activities that we organize, such as movie nights or music workshops, help to get the volunteers to bond. And then, when you call them to, let’s say, a volunteering action, they will come. Because you don’t just call them when you need them.“
Another way in which “Most” tries to reconnect the youth with growth opportunities is through exchanges. In this way, teenagers get to meet their fellow Europeans and overcome marginality. Youngsters as young as 16 can apply, and spend some time in other European countries. “For young people it’s an amazing thing, when you’re like 16-17 and you get a chance to travel for 10 days to the Czech Republic, to Croatia, to hang out with other people from all across Europe, to meet new cultures.This kind of spreads their mind, you know. You get a bit more open-minded and then you’ll see how many chances you have.“
When asked about the future of “Most”, Zorana says: “We cannot predict the things that will happen in the future. This past year has taught us that none of our plans are written in stone. But still, I think that, in the future, we’re going to have to make a stronger team. Sure, we have a lot of activities now, but I envision making it even bigger. I would like to include more people, even from all around Bosnia.“
“To reconnect the youth all over the country, that’s kind of our plan.”
Last year, “Most” hosted a project that included ten cities from all around the country, from Bihac to Travnik. That was an opportunity for people to connect, hang out, talk, across the entities’ boundaries. “So, in the future, we will much like to continue like that. To reconnect the youth all over the country, that’s kind of our plan.” There is probably no better example of howcivil society can be the force for change in Bosnia. While older generations continue to hold on to clientelistic networks of power and old grievances, there is still a chance for young people. After all, aren’t they the future?

The US Military’s Extremism Problem,"Therecent storming of the Capitol– an attempt by Trump supporters to disrupt the confirmation of the electoral college vote on the 6th of January 2021 – has highlighted a systemic problem within theUS military.Those charged with protecting theUSA’s interests instead turned their weapons on their own government, with 21 of the first 150 protesters arrested being active or former military personnel. Beyond mere Trumpian ideals, these servicemen and women have been linked to anarchist, racist, and fundamentalist groups, some wishing to topple the government to establish“an all-White paradise”.
There have long been tell-tale signs of deeply rooted racism in the US military, with theOklahoma City bombingand theBurmeister murdercasesome of the most poignant examples of the 1990s. This can be traced back to theestablishment of the White Patriot Party by Glenn Miller, who hoarded ammunition and explosives, enticing military personnel fresh from the Vietnam War to join him in his mission to topple the government and start a race war. Despite his arrest and subsequent sentencing, his legacy has lived on amongst military personnel, with manyblatantly voicing similar extremist beliefs.
Amongst the Capitol Hill protesters, there were many high-profile names such as veteranJoseph Randall Biggsand would-be Republican candidateCaptain Gabriel Garcia. Both are professed members of the far-right and neo-fascist groupProud Boys, with the former leading the extremists in their attacks against the Capitol building. The Proud Boys were named by Canada as a terrorist organization this year for violence and planned attacks, as well as their pivotal role in the Capitol riots. This group has been notorious for its violence against supporters of the left, as well as their demands to close the border with Mexico, scrap all gun regulations, and place restrictions on working women. They have been banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.
Ex-marines Ryan Nichols and Alex Hardrideralso made themselves known during the protests by calling for the crowds to arm themselves.Veteran Joshua Lollarlive-streamed himself breaking into the capitol building and confessed to attacking police officers. Furthermore, three members of the far-right Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, Donovan Crowl,and Thomas Caldwellhave been accused of orchestrating insurrection.The Oath Keepersare an anti-government organization made up of current and former military and police that has approximately 5,000 members, making them one of the largest militias in the USA. Their leader,ex-paratrooper Stewart Rhodes, has denied his involvement in the forced entry and attack of the Capitol building, saying that he and his comrades were only at the riots to protect Trump supporters from Antifa.
In the past, efforts made by the US Department of Defense have been largely ineffective, with manyextremist tendencies being overlooked. For example,Burmeisteris said to have hung a swastika in his barracks and read white supremacist newspapers, but a lack of active participation in extremist activities meant that Department of Defense policy fell short and could not condemn him. While this policy was updated following the murders that he carried out – meaning that personnel could not participate in“organizations that espouse supremacist causes”– it did not forbid membership and it left it up to other personnel to decide whether the serviceman or woman was truly at fault.
Following the riots of January 2021,Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin IIIhas sought to tackle this problem by creating a new working group to counter extremism and implementing new transition instructions to army veterans regarding the dangers of radicalization by extremist anti-government groups. This working group will be active across departments within the military to ensure that extremists do not infiltrate their ranks and radicalize other servicemen and women. The Biden administration has been very supportive of these policy changes and has also pushed for the implementation of screening upon recruitment and behavior monitoring while recruits are still in active service.
One of the reasons that progress has been slow, however, is thelack of a clear-cut definition for extremism.While the aforementioned policy changes have been effectuated to minimize the chances for radicalization while serving, the policy does not provide a definition for extremism, nor does it describe its causes. This hampers the ability of leaders within the military to effectively carry out and implement changes to the policy, despite UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres labeling U.S. extremism a threat to international social cohesion. Indeed, the US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas sees“domestic violent extremism as the ‘greatest threat’ to the United States”.

Latin American Soft Power During the Latest Olympic Games,"Joseph Nye, one of the most important academic figures in political science, coined the concept ‘soft power’ as the capacity of a country to achieve its political objectives because other countries share its values and aspire to follow its path. Soft power isn’t something that can be built in one day, nor bought with high-income rates—even though that may help.
This type of power is distinct from hard power, like military might, because it is numerically unmeasurable. Namely, we aren’t able to rank the 10 most powerful countries in terms of soft power, but that doesn’t mean it is less important. On the contrary, living in the era of social media and fast global communication, governments are realizing the relevance of soft power as a tool for international politics.
In this context, the Olympic Games are fertile ground for countries to cultivate this unique type of power.This happens because, as the definition stands, soft power has to do with values, aspirations, and even dreams. This is the reason why the mystique of the legends that grow in the field of the Olympic Games has been a crucial piece of world politics throughout history. A clear example of this phenomenon is Nadia Comaneci, the young Romanian gymnast who achieved a perfect ten during the Cold War era. It is important to highlight that this event wasn’t a coincidence. The Soviet Union, as well as the United States, saw that the Olympics were an opportunity to reinforce soft power and invest in the formation of highly trained athletes that would represent the country.
Just like the Soviet Union and theUnited States,Latin Americahas followed this strategy too, but with a smaller audience: their own region. In order to do this, two principal elements of analysis are important to consider.
Furthermore, there are some countries that stand out from the rest because of their use of a soft power strategy in the Olympic Games: Cuba, Brazil, and Venezuela.
On one hand, focusing on the budget analysis,Brazilstands out as the country that invests the most in athletics. According to an investigation by Forbes Dominican Republic (2015),the Brazilian government spends $842.4 million dollars per year on athletics, including on the promotion of high-performance athletes. Cuba ranks seventh in the region, investing $62.1 million in athletics. This is not a minor piece of data if other economic indicators are taken into account. In that same year, Brazil’s PIB was1,802 billion dollars, while Cuba’s PIB was87,133 million dollars. This means that, in proportion to their economy’s production, the percentage invested by Cuba in athletics is higher.
Although both countries’ sports budgets appear to be high for low or middle-income Latin-American countries, they are extremely low compared to the athletic budget in other regions such asEurope. Countries like Spain spend almost 3 billion dollars on athletics, which is not even one percent of their total public spending. This is the reason why a budget analysis that takes several economic indicators into account needs to be done according to the region. Unfortunately, at the time this article was written, there was no public data on Venezuela’s budget, so a long-term strategic analysis in this country couldn’t be performed.
On the other hand, structural difficulties in Latin-American countries’ public accounts create the need to analyze other factors, such as governmentcommunication. During the last Olympic Games, the region witnessed several declarations of high-ranking politicians regarding the outstanding athletes of their countries.
One of the best examples of the ideas developed in this article is the story ofRebecca Andrade, the gymnast that achieved the first gold medal in women’s gymnastics for Brazil, and for the whole region. Rebecca is a black girl who comes from a humble background and was raised by a single mother, along with four other siblings. She started her career in gymnastics in school as a part of a social program called “Second Half”, in accordance with a group of policies of massification of sports that took place under the government of Inácio “Lula” da Silva.
This is the reason why the ex-president and possible candidate for the next presidential election showed support for this athlete on his social media. Eloi Pietá, Mayor of Guarulhos, the state where Rebecca grew up, also said:“Rebeca Andrade’s is a case that symbolically brings together three things: talent, effort,and personal dedication, family support,and social policy. Without these three things, she would not achieve the result. Without that policy of sports massification, without the support of her mother, siblings, and coaches, and without her talent and individual effort we would not have those medals at the Olympic Games”.Pietá is a member of the Workers’ Party like Lula and was in charge of the policies around the massification of sports in this state.
“Rebeca Andrade’s is a case that symbolically brings together three things: talent, effort and personal dedication, family support and social policy. Without these three things she would not achieve the result. Without that policy of sport massification, without the support of her mother, siblings and coaches, and without her talent and individual effort we would not have those medals at the Olympic Games.”
Another event relevant to the communication analysis is thetelephone call between Yulimar Rojas and Nicolas Maduro, President ofVenezuela. Yulimar is a Venezuelan athlete that was trained in Spain. Not only did she win the gold medal in the long jump try-out, but she also beat the world record in that discipline. A video spread on social media showed her taking a call from Maduro in which he congratulated her in the name of Venezuela for her achievement. During the telephone call, when Maduro called her “the Queen of Tokyo”, Yulimar was in an emotional state because of her triumph and said that she was happy to be a part of “the best country in the world”; a land that she calls “a warrior land”.
Another relevant example is the declaration of some Cuban athletes after winning their medals, thanking Fidel Castro for his actions regarding athletics. Focusing on the government’s communication specifically, we were able to see Miguel Díaz Canel, the current president of Cuba, taking an active role on social media by congratulating the athletes. He even had video calls with some of them that were transmitted on national television.
Venezuela’s government has been a source of controversy regarding its declaration.The situation involved a Venezuelan boxer,Eldric Sella, who participated as a member of the Refugees delegation. Sella explained that he was helped by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be a part of the refugee delegation because Trinidad and Tobago, the country where he was living, refused to give him a visa because his Venezuelan passport had expired. In this situation, after he was eliminated from the competition in the first round, Jorge Arreaza, Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared that Sella wasn’t really a refugee because he wasn’t pursued in Venezuela, and he could come back whenever he wanted. The minister also declared that “[UNHCR]used him ideologically against Venezuela”because Eldric Sella has “emigrated” to Trinidad and Tobago so he “didn’t apply” to the status of refugee.
In conclusion, looking at budgets for athletics, it is necessary to highlight Cuba’s high percentage of investment and Brazil’s long-term policies in this matter.Both of them may apply this type of policy, not only because it may create high-level athletes to compete at an international level, but also as a policy of social containment. On the other hand, Venezuela stands out the most in the use of communication as a political strategy because it is not only used to congratulate its athletes but also to fight the figures and institutions that articulate opposition in their political speeches. All in all, these counties’ strategies are based on their budget or in their communication and serve as useful elements that contribute to the articulation of a state’s soft power.

Is There a Way Out of Brazilian Political Manichaeism?,"The date, 2 October 2022, isset. The clock is ticking. And preparations for the next Brazilian general election will soon be underway. As of now, polls show incumbentJair Bolsonaroand former presidentLuis Inácio “Lula” da Silvaas the front-runners.
But they also reveal another important figure:rejection ratesand acall for change. Both candidates are very divisive figures who muster support by instigating fear about the other. If a legitimate challenger were to arise and defuse the Lula-Bolsonaro dichotomy, they could be well-positioned to prevail.
Since the end ofBrazil’smilitary regime in 1985, the only real political movements that stand out areLulismoandBolsonarismo.Both are personalistic movements based on a belief that their leader is the only one who can defend one side of the political spectrum against the other. And their leaders mirror that belief with a Messiah Complex.
Both groups are very antagonistic. Hardcore Bolsonaro voters echo their candidate inportrayingLula as a ‘communist demon’ eager to turn Brazil into “the next Venezuela.” Hardcore Lula voters, conversely,depictBolsonaro as an aspiring totalitarian and borderline fascist leader who serves the Brazilian elite.
The reason why the two candidates stand so far ahead of the pack right now is that both leaders possess a very fierce, loyal, and noisy core of voters. As of January 2022, that core group of voters represented 34% and 20% for Lula and Bolsonaro, respectively, per a pollpromotedby EXAME/IDEA.
But above all, both groups are resorting to the same strategy to foster their candidate’s support: Tactical Voting.
Under itscurrentvoting system, Brazilian presidents are elected by a simple majority. If no candidate receives enough votes for a majority in one round, a run-off between the two best-performing candidates takes place.
In that scenario, Brazilians who are unsatisfied with the two already front-runners, are nonetheless encouraged to take one of them into the run-off, as they are convinced that the chances of their preferred candidate making it past the second round are seemly slim to non-existent. Thus, many voters are cajoled into settling for what they regard as the lesser of two evils.
Choosing the lesser of two evils is, however, something that Brazilian voters are increasingly unwilling to do, as rejection rates and desire for a third-way candidate are high across Brazilian society.
In terms ofrejection, a poll made by Data Folha in December 2021suggeststhat 60% of the population dislike Bolsonaro. Lula fairs better, but with a still elevated 34% rejection rate. Regarding a desire for change, non-stimulated polls, when voters are not given a list of opinions, reveal that many voters have currently not decided who to vote for. As of January 2022, 25% of votersclaimedto be undecided, and 12% said that they would not vote for any of the currently available options.
Such rejection rates for both figures are understandable. On the one hand, Lula’s administration was beset by corruption scandals that led many of its former ministers and, later, even Lula himself to be jailed (read our analysis here). Lula is now free, but around 57% of Braziliansbelievethat his arrest was warranted. Additionally, there is no way to dissociate Lula from his less successful successor, Dilma Rousseff, who inherited Lula’s unsustainable economic growth model based on public debt.
The Bolsonaro administration, on the other hand, faced its own set challenges, ranging from corruptionscandalsinvolving allies and the president’s sons, three of which are also politicians, along with economic and sanitary mismanagement during thepandemic. The sitting president has also had to deal with the backlash from always being in ‘campaign mode’.
From the beginning of his term, Bolsonaro has sought to appease its core group of supporters by attacking groups that these supporters saw as enemies. In particular, the president has picked fights against key figures in the legislative, the judiciary and issued inflammatory speeches against opposition groups. While this tactic yielded little result expanding its base of supporters, it has eroded the president’s popularity to such an extent that he is no longer capable of promoting any reform in the country, even if he wanted to.
The time is, therefore, ripe for a third way to materialize. Right now, pollsindicatethat alternative candidates could win against Lula or Bolsonaro in a run-off. The issue is indeed making it into that run-off.
There is no obvious challenger to the Lula-Bolsonaro dyad.Other relevant political figures do stand out. But there are three problems yet to be overcome by whoever wants to receive the presidential sash.
The first is fragmentation and infighting amongst potential candidates. With rejection rates of Lula and Bolsonaro on the rise, many potential candidates smelled blood and flocked to launch themselves as viable presidential hopefuls. This includesJoão Doria, the governor of the state of São Paulo,Ciro Gomes, a former finance minister and congressman, andSergio Moro, the judge who was in charge of Lula’s arrest. Together, these three candidatesaccountfor 22% of voting intentions, about as much as Bolsonaro’s.
However, all these candidates are fighting for the same group of disillusioned voters, making it harder for any of them to mount a viable campaign for making into the run-off. Such division plays right into a ‘divide and conquer’ strategy promoted by the two front runners.
The second challenge faced by potential challengers is to build a coalition strong enough to support their campaign.InBrazil, important elements of a political campaign, such as television airtime and public funding aredeterminedby the strength of the coalition of political parties that a candidate has in its support. The more parties you have in your favor, and the stronger they are within the parliament, the more money and exposure you get.
Unfortunately for these candidates, Brazil’s political constellation is made up of a nightmarish patchwork of24 parties,most of which have no fixed alliances or ideology, who have resources and reach to help with the aspirations of presidential hopefuls. The problem is that, with only one year left before the vote, there will be little time for a third-way candidate to stand out and gather enough support from these non-pledged parties.
In conclusion, both Lula and Bolsonaro have never been weaker. Their rejection is high and their survival is directly linked to the perception that the two are the only available options. However, there is no obvious challenger to their supremacy as of now. And, if one arises, it will be a tough uphill battle.

One Year of The New Security Law in Hong Kong: An Assessment of the State of Democracy,"Hong Kongis a former British colony that was overtaken byChinain 1997. Maintaining a separate legal system from Mainland China, Hong Kong has rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. These freedoms are assured by Basic Law which is set to expire in 2047, making the future of the former colony uncertain. Signs of erosion of democratic principles in the past two years have led to a series of protests.
In June 2019, protests broke out against a plan to allow extradition to mainland China. People in Hong Kong feared that the bill would pave the way for unfair trials and censorship of political opposition, as well as exponential increases in control by mainland China over the territory. Despite the bill being revoked, Hongkongers feared that it would be reintroduced, and thus continued to take the streets with a significant escalation in October 2019, particularly on the 1st of October when China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party Rule. After that, violence between police and protesters escalated until December when the local council elections saw pro-democracy forces win 17 out of 18 councils.
More than a year has passed since Beijing introduced theNew Security Law, a set of policies aimed at restoring stability through the “one country – two systems” principle.The New Global Ordercovered the policy at the time. The most salient and worrying provisions are the ones that indirectly aimed at silencing freedom of speech. For instance, ‘The vaguely defined acts of ‘secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with external forces’ will be criminalized”. The main issue with the policy is its vagueness and its ability to legislate a wide array of pro-democracy actors. AsAmnestyreports, the law has been abused from day one.
Furthermore,Al Jazeerareported on September 1, 2021, that nine activists were arrested for participating in the 2019 protests in an arguably violent manner.Two Hong Kong activistshave pleaded guilty under the territory’s national security law in a case linked to jailed pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the popular newspaper Apple Daily. Moreover, as of now, another onehundred thirty peoplehave been arrested under the law. Finally, the law has been used to tighten control over education, media, and information in general.
Targetting information and freedom of expression is at the center of China’s plan to suppress democracy and align Hong Kong to the Chinese model. The national security law is an efficient tool thanks to its broad and vague definitions, allowing it to easily be used to silence and condemn any voice which goes against China. Expressions such as “subversion” “secession” and “terrorism” can be attributed to any political expression or opinion. This creates an arbitrary application of the law at the discretion of the central government. In fact, the government did not hesitate to abuse the law from day one, in order to suppress freedom of expression.
Today, one can say that press freedom is non-existent. Journals, magazines, and news media reporting information related to pro-democracy, pro-independence, or that is in any way compromising to the image of China, are silenced and closed, mainly with the accusation of “subversion”. Particularly significant was the closure ofApple Daily,one of the biggest autonomous journals in the region. Asthe Guardianreports, this journal has been the symbol of independence, rebellion, and democracy, with its investigations into government issues and its extensive coverage of the past protests. For this reason, the media outlet was one of the first targets of the government.
Theoppressionwas gradual; it started in August 2020 with the arrest and imprisonment of the founder Jilly Lai, who was accused of multiple charges including “conspiracy to defraud,” “terrorism” and “colluding with foreign elements”, and continued with the recent arrest of five senior Apple Daily executives. In May 2021, the government froze the company’s finances and on June 24, Apple Daily officially closed due to financial distress.
Freedom of the press is under attack, not only in terms of censorship of pro-democracy media outlets such as Apple Daily, but also in the way China reports on the protests to its Mainland citizens.DWdemonstrated that as soon as the protests broke out in 2019, China denounced Western media for being biased, instilling mistrust of outside voices. The People’s Daily painted the protests as a violation of the “one country, two systems” principle and deemed it a terrorist attack on the rule of law and the freedom of Hongkongers. Despite this, many observers claim the opposite regarding China, when talking about China’s intention to revert to a de facto  “one country, one system.” To instill fear and confusion in Chinese readers, Chinese media created parallelisms between the violence of the Islamic State and the protests, going as far as toaffirmthat the protestors commit suicide bombings against the modern city of Hong Kong.
Moreover, asBBCreported, Chinese media outlets kept silent during the first days of protests and started covering the events only once the protestors broke into Hong Kong’s parliament, without contextualization any of the acts, focusing mostly on lawlessness. The attack on freedom not only involves the press and information but also popular participation and opposition. A Human Rights Watch report investigates how protests and movements of civil society are being suppressed, with accusations of “collusion with a foreign power”, attempts of “secession” and “sedition.”
The people involved are targeted and can face criminal charges for simple participation or for slogans calling for Hong Kong independence. According to BBC, more than 50 pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested with the accusation of trying to “overthrow” the government. These include activists such as Joshua Wong, human rights lawyers, academics, and the most prominent voices of the 2019 protests. Moreover, peaceful protests have been prohibited, using the excuse of the COVID-19 pandemic.
China’s goal of aligning Hong Kong with the Chinese model is clear, however, this time the strategy is different from the one enacted in China in the 1990s, during the Tiananmen Square Massare. Abrupt, bloody oppression through a military intervention like the one in Tienanmen Square would be ineffective for Hong Kong because it would only end up highlighting explicit authoritarianism and promote a negative image of China. Today, China aims for an implicit control of power and more gradual and strategic oppression, which targets information, freedom of expression, education, and patriotism. By shaping people’s cultures and minds, this strategy is even more effective, with the risk of inculcating China’s values and principles from within.
The destiny of Hong Kong is in the hands of its people. Hongkongers have to make the decision to escape to places where they can maintain a life of freedom and democracy for themselves and their children. But escaping will not save Hong Kong, it will only give victory to China. The people of Hong Kong will have to fight in order to resist China’s cultural propaganda, by maintaining the memory of the past struggles and people that have made it a democratic, free, and dynamic country. This is going to be a difficult challenge, especially in refusing to conform and facing the risk of legal repercussions. They will have to enact the same strategy as China, withmemoryandvaluesbeing the weapons they use to fight for their democracy.

A New Dawn of the EU-US Relationship in Digital and Tech Issues,"With theelection of Joe Biden as the46th president of the United States,the lawmakers of both theEuropean UnionandUnited Stateshave expressed their desire for anew dawn in transatlantic ties. Hopes for a new EU-US relationship has emerged, especially in regard todigitalandtechissues. As of recently, there are a considerable number of challenges that need to be addressed in this specific area.
On 20 January 2021, several MEPs welcomed the appointment ofJoe Bidenas the new president of the US. It was seen as a chance to reinforce the EU-US relationship to tackle common challenges. Particularly emphasizing the need to regulate tech giants. The MEP Manfred Weber (EPP, DE) emphasized thattech giants need clear rules as they should serve society.
Furthermore,Derk Jan Eppink(ECR, NL) expressed his concern about tech giants silencing public debate or politicians, claiming that:
“big tech companies abuse their dominant position. Their power must be broken”.
Finally, the president of the Commission,Ursula von der Leyen, expressed her desire tocooperate with the USregarding regulations. “The unbridled political power of internet giants must be reined in” as their behavior must be dictated by law instead of “arbitrary decisions made by a Silicon Valley CEO”, she stated.
The primary aim of this new transatlantic agenda is tobuild up a global digital regulation.Hence, the EU, after having implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is now considering tackling other challenges in the tech industry. For instance, by implementing an e-Privacy Regulation addressing online marketing and cookies, the regulation of online platforms, AI ethics, and legislation to expand copyright online.
In addressing these challenges in the digital and tech trade, the EU is seeking to cooperate with the US to developcommon standards for emerging technologies. Also, to commit to better control and regulation of the digital world, currently ruled by a few tech ‘titans’ in Silicon Valley.
As a consequence, von der Leyen proposed to create an EU-US common Technology Council, which was subsequently launched by both her and Biden during the EU-US Summit in Brussels on June 15, 2021.
By coordinating on tech issues throughout the common Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and by setting up the framework for digital regulation, the EU and the US aim at establishing real global standards that other countries such asAustraliaorCanadamay follow. These standards will particularly take into account, as stated by Margrethe Vestager (the Commission’s executive vice-president in charge of digital policy), individuals’ privacy and dignity.
The regulations, which have been proposed by the EU, will especially impact tech giants; which are all US-based companies. Such as Facebook, Apple, and Google. However, regarding the regulation of AI, the EU aims at putting in place restrictions that would not constrain technological advantages or advances.
This new EU-US tech alliance and the creation of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) to set up common regulatory standards in digital issues is also considered to be a strategic move to oppose China’s tech rise. Although the US is still the leader, the Chinese tech sector is rapidly growing – aiming to become a global superpower.
This gives another explanation to the cooperation between the EU and the US and their efforts to become global standard setters. In fact, as part of the renewed tech alliance between the EU and the US, it has been proposed to foster more investments and innovation across the two regions. By doing so, both the EU and the US will be able to compete againstChina’s top-down economic model and will try to fight back China’s expansion as a tech superpower.

Reform or Bust: Mercosur at 31,"In February 2022, Mercosur celebrated its 31st anniversary, closing a year in which the bloc managed to agree on a framework to reduce tariffs, after almost a decade without any major advances economically. This may sound like integration in the South Cone is back on track, however, there is still bickering and disagreement over the future of the bloc that was once a promising organization but seems to have lost its momentum and sense of direction.
Mercosur, the customs union originally formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay in 1991, was born under ‘perfect; conditions. Firstly, there was a huge international appetite for regional and bilateral trade deals, especially as countries found it increasingly hard to close the Uruguay Round at theWorld Trade Organization. In 1990 alone, fifty trade agreements came into force. Secondly, there was an almost perfect convergence among like-minded governments, such as that of Menem inArgentinaand Collor inBrazil. Thirdly, the South Cone finally replaced civil-military regimes with newly-established democratic governments, paving the way for less distrust and nationalistic mentalities among the to-be bloc members.

Fast-forward thirty years and not many significant advances have been made. Despite the recent frameworkagreementto reduce the common external tariff (CET) by a tenth in almost 87 percent of the products traded to the bloc, Mercosur came to be seen during the past years as stagnant and dysfunctional so much so that fears of fracturing became palpable after president Lacalle Pou from Uruguayhintedat the possibility of his country pursuing a trade agreement with China on its own outside the Mercosur framework. Before that, Brasília wasthreateningto bypass the CET altogether by imposing a unilateral reduction of its tariffs.
Bearing in mind that the founders of Mercosur meant for it to become a common market as its name suggests, the increasing skeptical, outward-looking positions of its members suggesteda dramatic fall from grace is imminent.
Three major factors can help explain how the bloc got here. The first is the stagnation of intra-bloc trade and the difficulties posed to the signing of new trade deals with new partners. The second is the existence of open wounds resulting from institutional crises in the last decade. The third and final is the lack of political alignment between state members.
Mercosur got off to a hot start. The creation of a free-market and customs union led to an impressive increase in intra-bloc trade. In 1991, trade among Mercosur membersamountedto only US$ 9.11 billion. In 2011, when intra-bloc trade peaked, thefigurewas almost six times higher, at US$ 54.2 billion. Further, Mercosur negotiated important agreements with other regional arrangements, such as the Andean Community and theEuropean Union, which supported the bloc’s unified front for brokering better deals with the outside world.
At the beginning of the last decade, Mercosur seemed to run out of fuel. From its peak in 2011, trade among membersrecededto $41.6 billion in 2018. Beyond absolute numbers, intra-bloc trade also lost importance in relative terms. Even when trade among member states increased, intra-Mercosur tradebecameless representative over the years. In 2000, exports within the bloc represented 21% of total exports for member states. In 2013, that ratio dropped to 14.8%. Simultaneously, trade with non-traditional partners, notablyChina, grew rapidly. As of 2021, exports to Asian countries represent 48% of Mercosur exports. As non-Mercosur exports grew in importance, so did the pressure from some member states, such as Brazil and Uruguay, for a more outward-looking Mercosur.
Unfortunately, however, the bloc has fared poorly in brokering deals with the outside world. Today, only three free-trade agreements have come into effect between the bloc and third parties: one withEgypt, one withIsrael, and one with the Andean Community. Mercosur’s biggest bets are an agreement with the European Union and one with the European Free Trade Association, both signed in July 2019. Both are unlikely to come into effect soon because opposition to these deals remains intense among many European countries – mainly due toenvironmental issues related to Brazil’s inadequate protection of the Amazon rainforest. A survey by YouGov revealed that an average of 75% of Europeansopposethe deals.

-1%
With little success in fostering trade with outside partners, it is no surprise that Mercosur came to be seen as an obstacle rather than a springboard for the integration of member states into the global trade system. Worryingly, the bloc has failed to even start meaningful negotiations with major Asian markets, which are currently the bloc’s leading trading partners.
The biggest political crisis of Mercosur, and one that has left wounds not yet healed, was the suspension of Paraguay and the almost immediate ascension of Venezuela to full membership of the bloc. MercosursuspendedParaguay after the dismissal of president Fernando Lugo in 2012, which was considered a breach of the bloc democratic clause: the Ushuaia Protocol. At that time, the country was the only member not to ratify Venezuela’s full entry to the bloc and as soon as Paraguay was suspended, the other three members rushed to announce the club’s new addition.
Not only was the decision harshly criticized for its motives and questionable procedure, but also paved the way for a new crisis: the Venezuelansuspensionin 2017. By then, President Nicolás Maduro and his government faced several accusations of violating democratic order after he decided to strip the opposition-controlled National Assembly from its powers. On top of that, it was also criticized for human rights abuses in relation to its treatment of political dissent.
Because of these two major institutional crises, there has been bad blood among member states. In particular, Paraguay resented the way it was forced into suspension andbecame, together with Brazil, one of the leading voices regarding Venezuela’s suspension. Furthermore, upon being reinstated in the bloc, Paraguayannouncedthat it would be no longer bound by the Ushuaia II Protocol regarding sanctions for breaches of democratic order. The same will probably happen when, or if, Venezuela is reinstated, further undermining the institutional strength of the bloc.
Mercosur’s existence and progress were much easier under combinations of like-minded, or at least non-confrontational, governments at the helm in each member state. First with the reigning economically-orthodox governments from the 1990s, and later with the ascension of the so-called Pink Tide of left-leaning administrations. Such political alignment or, at the very least, lack of open opposition paved the way for understanding within the bloc.
That is no longer the case, and three examples indicate misalignment among state members. First is the fact that the Paraguayan government of Mario Abdo Benítez has had no diplomatic ties with Venezuela since 2019. The second is theincreasing isolation of Alberto Fernandez’s government in Argentinawithin the bloc and its constant confrontations with Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay because of its protectionist stances. Such a stance even led to an openquarrelbetween Fernandez and Lacalle Pou in March of the current year during a discussion on reducing the CET. On that occasion, Fernandez took it personally when Lacalle Pou suggested that the Mercosur was becoming a burden and a heated debate ensued. The third example is the tense relationship between Brazil and Argentina due to Bolsonaro’s open support for Macri’s reelection attempt in 2019.
As long as misalignment persists, it will be difficult for a consensus-based organization such as the Mercosur to engage in any meaningful attempt to reform.
It remains to be seen whether a miracle, economic or political, can save the bloc. Perhaps its member states are just too different in size and economic interests to work well together. Especially since Brazil and Argentina, Mercosur’s original paymasters, don’t appear very open to compromise at the moment. In this case, the bloc is living a “Weekend at Bernie” trajectory, cinematically speaking. It is dead, but it is useful to pretend that it is still alive. This is not to say that members will not occasionally find moments of convergence and consensus, just like in October 2021, when theyagreedon a framework to reduce the bloc’s common external tariffs by as much as 10%. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Mercosur will come back to deliver as many breakthroughs as it did during the first half of its existence.
Perhaps this could be an opportunity for a complete overhaul of the bloc. Just as NAFTA eventually had to morph into USMCA, Mercosur members could leave aside their pride just for a moment and admit that no one is happy with the current state of the bloc. Perhaps a war like that between Russia and Ukraine might just be the push Mercosur members need to reform the bloc and sell it as an alternative to other, less trustworthy, or geopolitically unstable, markets. It remains to be seen whether Mercosur’s members can once again find a way to thrive together.

A Prominent Middle Power No More: Canada’s Fledgling Foreign Policy,"With Canada entering into an election on September 20th, there are many public policy initiatives at the forefront of the major federal parties of Canada that desire to govern. Fromindigenous rights and sovereignty issues, public health and COVID-19, education, the economy, and climate change, it is clear that the election will strictly focus on domestic issues.
However, early on in the election, the presiding Liberal Government of Canada, under the leadership of Justin Trudeau,witnessed and took part in the ill-mannered withdrawal of military troops and civilians from Afghanistan. Although the stories and images from news broadcasters, social media, and first-hand accounts were shocking, the event did not have significant implications or points of discussion for the political parties or leaders partaking in the ongoing election.
Against the backdrop of deepening strategic competition in international relations,the election showcases the lacking nature and quality of Canada’s foreign policy and services for the emerging multipolar order. From a once integrated and paramount middle power of the international rules-based order, Canada’s diplomatic and middle power status has become jeopardized as a result of Canadian political leaders, parliamentarians, and the general public’s reservation of foreign affairs’ role in preserving and promoting prosperity and peace, along with advancing and attaining Canadian interests.
As the first entry of a three-part analysis on Canada’s foreign policy, this article will examine and highlight the mismanagement of Canadian foreign affairs, the lack of interest from the Canadian public, and its values-centric foreign policy. These will form key evidence of Canada’s inadequacy among allies and like-minded partners to preserve the international rules-based order, deter significant forms of aggression from autocratic and belligerent states, and address pivotal global and regional threats and challenges to Canada’s national security.
Following the sacrifice of Canadian soldiers during the First World War, Canada attained the ability to project and proclaim itsforeign policy interestsindependent of the British Empire. Maintaining this strategic autonomy in its foreign policy, Canada continued to measure its international interests against a growing bilateral relationship with the US. Although it is not easy to manage and project an independent foreign policy away from the regional and global hegemon that is the US,Canada has forged and directed its special relationship with America through shared geo-security and geo-economic interests, values, and norms.Together these initiatives helped establish the US-led post-war rules-based order without costing Canada its ability to practice and produce an independent foreign policy.
From all previousU.S. presidents and Canadian prime ministers, such as Diefenbaker and Kennedy, Pierre Trudeau and Nixon, Chretien and Clinton, or Martin and Bush, Canada has managed its strategic autonomy to identify and attain its foreign policy interests while springing the special relationship forward.However, the special relationship has become strained due to the Harper-Obama and Trudeau-Trump years, and Canada’s strategic autonomy being undervalued.
Under the leadership of Stephan Harper, Canadian foreign policy undertook hisneoconservative outlookof managing Canada as a military power bent on reinforcing theBush Doctrinein a period of declining state-building and growing passivity, and a strategic pivot to Asia under President Obama. Under the current prime minister,Justin Trudeau showed an incapacity to stand up to Trump’s unilateral “America First” foreign policy outlook that overtly weakened allies and like-minded partners on shared issues over trade, defence, and security.As a result of these two past Canadian governments, the nation’s political leaders and party members have abandoned foreign policy as an instrument that canguide and alignthe special relationship to the new realities and affairs that will manage the global multipolar order.
Unlike the US’s pivot to Asia to balance China’s eminent great power rise,Sino-Canadian relations during the early years of the Trudeau administration sought to continue his late father’s legacy of revitalizing bilateraleconomic, political, and cultural ties.Although Trudeau was initially successful in attaining diplomaticinvitationsandmeetingswith Chinese President Xi Jinping and diplomatic officials at formal multilateral institutions like the G20, the arrival of President Trump hindered Canada’s strategic autonomy in Sino-Canadian affairs.
With Trump determined to “make America great again,” his foreign policy took on a more populist and nationalist perspective withadversaries and allies alike.In particular, the former US president sought to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico to showcase his commitment to a campaign pledge.For Trump, NAFTA was“the worst trade deal ever made”for American dairy farmers, auto and civil manufacturers. In NAFTA’s place came an updated vision called the Canada-US-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).
However, unlike past free trade agreements,CUSMA also established a“China Clause,”requiring all members to notify each other of entering into a free trade agreement with a “non-market” country.Although Trump’s negotiating team dismissed the clause as a tool serving US geopolitical interests, its addition in CUSMA highlighted Trump’s growing strategic endeavour to limit Chinese intellectual dominance by deposing its ability tomisappropriate intellectual property.
To make matters worse for Canada’s diplomatic and strategic autonomy, the “China Clause” was followed up by a request from the US Department of Justice to detain Chinese telecom giant and Huawei CFOMeng Wanzhou. Allegedly accused of doing business with Iran in 2013, thereby violating US sanctions against Iran, Meng was arrested by Canadian police and placed under house arrest while awaiting an extradition hearing in Canadian courts.Immediately following this event, China detained and arrested two Canadian citizens,Michael Spavour and Michael Korvig, under charges of espionage.
Whether the Trudeau government feared the wrath of Trump withdrawing from the CUSMA talks or placing stricter tariffs on Canadian public goods,the absence of Canada’s diplomatic and strategic autonomy in assessing the detainment of Meng Wanzhou with its national interests has overtly neutralized Canada’s ability to independently prioritize and set out its geopolitical relations with China going forward.Instead, Canada has become integrated into the middle of growing Sino-US power politics at the cost of two Canadian citizens and its diplomatic voice in deepening global issues over China’s belligerence to the rules-based order.
During a parliamentary vote to label the human rights abuses in Xinjiang as a genocide—an international pillar Canada helped create and lead during the Cold War—Trudeau abstained from votingto limit the diplomatic backlash arriving from China.Clearly, Sino-Canadian relations have entered into a period of agitation, uncertainty, and mistrust, a stark contrast to Pierre Trudeau’s engagement with China in 1970 that helpednormalize relationsbetween China and the developed world.
Canadian foreign policy misgivings have also seen the Trudeau government dwindle in its status as a reliable and trusting middle power globally.Declaring that“Canada is back”during his election victory speech in 2015, the global community eagerly awaited Canada’s re-emergence as a pivotal and outstanding bridger of the developed and developing world. Trudeau’s proclamation, however, would ultimately fall on deaf ears.
As prime minister,Trudeau and his liberal party have missed the OECD target of 0.7 percent of GDI for Official Development Assistance (ODA) in the past six years, providing only0.27 percentof the country’s GDI.Moreover, Trudeau continued Stephen Harper’s policy ofselling arms to Saudi Arabia, a recognized human rights abuser, and lacked in the country’s formal commitments to NATO’s defence spending mandate of 2 percent GDP.Coupled with Canada’s dwindling peacekeeping commitment—a historical legacy and cornerstone of Canadian middle power status—these foreign policy misgivings resulted in Canada losing,for the second time in a decade, a bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
To make matters worse, this past August further showcased Canada’s inability to develop and execute a functional foreign policy towards Afghanistan. Albeit not solely responsible for the collapse of Afghanistan to the Taliban,Canada’s inability to plan independently and collectively with its allies on a rational withdrawal plan illustrates the low-ranking nature of foreign policy in the Trudeau government and Canadian politics—further exemplified by the other political partiesnot putting forward any proposed pledgesto improve and situate Canadian foreign policy for engaging in modern geopolitical, security and defence issues.
A notable problem in Canada’s foreign policy is that the current government has executed a strategy of high diplomatic rhetoric with significantly few attainable outcomes.As a result of this process, Canada has been relatively weak in setting out diplomatic priorities and geostrategic interests in a deepening competitive and contested global order.
“We’ve got the ability to make declarations, but [what] we really need is the ability to pursue our interests. And to do that, you have to define them first of all.”
A major criticism of Canadian foreign policy arrives from its recent values-based orientation that sees global affairs as a tool to court domestic votes in elections.During the Harper years, the conservative leader held staunch opposition to Putin’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Although such opposition is warranted and should act as a bridging point to develop a foreign policy to defend and uphold the rules-based order,Steven Harperinstead used the Russian-Ukrainian issue to cater to the Ukrainian population in Canada—the second-largest population outside Ukraine—to gain electoral votes. Justin Trudeau has taken this values-based approach to court progressives in Canada by declaring a feminist foreign policy during his election run in 2015, 2019, and 2021.
ACanadian feminist foreign policyaims to reflect on and bring forward Canada’s progress on developing feminist policies, strategies, and programs on enhanced diplomatic engagements and women, peace, and security (WPS).The Trudeau government claims that a feminist foreign policy offers a re-envisioned strategy tosolve social and economic inequalitiesthat undermine human rights, democracy, and the rules-based order’s norms, values, and institutions. However, there are two problematic aspects to Trudeau’s feminist foreign policy.
First, by catering to progressives in Canada,Trudeau has reinforced the position of foreign policy being a tool for domestic politics, thereby creating polarization on foreign policy issues that should be fundamental to all Canadian parties, politicians, and the general public—climate change, defence, security, intelligence, democratic and institution resiliency, NATO and a mandate to uphold the rules-based order.Second, the values-based nature of the feminist foreign policy produces hypocrisy.For instance, when Canada maintains anarms sale with Saudi Arabiaor fails tocondemn human rights abusesin China orfails to protect servicewomenin the Canadian military,it is difficult to wholeheartedly see how Canada can practically attain its diplomatic and geostrategic interests of resolving and enforcing gender norms and gender equality.
In addition, a feminist foreign policy hinders the very nature of diplomacy as it will compel illiberal, autocratic, and other democratic states—all necessary actors in addressing and solving global challenges to peace and prosperity—to observe Canada as a moralistic high-and-mighty nation that dares to dictate how they should behave to be considered a legitimate member of the international community,instead of attracting and influencing diplomatic dialogues on such issues.Values in foreign policy are vital, and they can assist in assessing and attaining diplomatic and geostrategic interests. With that said, they should not be the driving factor of a policy that isout-of-step and illogical with the realities of the rules-based order and the states that make up the international community.
The misgivings of Canada’s fledgling foreign policy emphasize the notion of Canada lacking the ability to be ageopolitically prominentcountry in a rapidly shifting global multipolar order. As the recent failed bid for the UNSC showcases,Canada is on track to become a “trick-a-box” nation that prioritizes“megaphone diplomacy”instead of prioritising practical engagement strategies that aim to address its national interests and those of the rules-based order.
Toparaphrase a letterfrom forty scholars, experts, and former diplomats from the Institute for Peace & Diplomacy to all Canadian federal party leaders:“if Canada continues to marginalize its foreign policy as a vital instrument for its national interests, it risks diminishing its ability to secure and promote the values, norms, and rules that have helped maintain global peace and prosperity.”Luckily for Canada, these misgivings can be readily corrected.","September 19, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/ready-a-prominent-middle-power-no-more-canadas-fledgling-foreign-policy/,Andrew Erskine,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Chile Is Changing,"Chile, despite being one of the most stable countries in Latin America, suffersa structural problem: inequality. The problem started with Pinochet’s seventeen-year-long dictatorship; where he changed the structure of Chile’s economy and made the neoliberal, free-market economic model, the law. In this system, the costly education reproduces class inequalities and the pension system leaves elderly people with a pittance.
To explain what is going on in Chile, it is quintessential to first understand what happened in the last two years.
In October of 2019, large-scale protests broke out over a 4-cent metro fare hike in the country’s capital, Santiago. Multitudes from diverse backgrounds converged in these protests, united in their shared anger over the deeply entrenched social inequality in Chile. There were more than 1.2 million people participating. The biggest demand was to reform the 1980 Constitution, sanctioned by dictator Augusto Pinochet, which it was argued to be the root of most of Chile’s inequality issues by giving undue weight to the country’s private sector. Furthermore, Pinochet’s constitution and his regime made the neoliberal, free-market economic model the law, leading to, among other things, the privatization of education, health care, and pensions.
A year after the massive protests, in October 2020, Chileans voted in the first constitutional referendum since the advent of democracy. Thereferendumasked whether a new constitution should be drafted, as well as the form in which it should be drafted: either by a constitutional convention made up by members elected directly for this convention or by a mixed constitutional convention made up with currently-sitting members of Parliament and directly elected citizens.
The plebiscite resulted in a resounding victory for the pro-reform camp; with 78% of votes in favor of adopting a new constitution and 79% opting for a Constitutional Convention as the preferred mode for writing it.
The Constitutional Convention is made up of 155 citizens, many of them entirely new to politics. Independent candidates won 48 seats, the left 28, the center-left 25, and the right-wing coalition 37. In addition, 17 seats are destined for representatives of Indigenous groups. Most of them aim to promote civic participation and better the protection of the environment in the new constitution.
In July 2021, the Constitutional Convention convened for the first time and elected its first president: Elisa Loncón. She is one of the 17 representatives of the Indigenous groups, with strong leadership within the Mapuche people. She also has a master’s degree in Linguistics. After she won as president of the Convention, she made a call for the unity of Chile and spoke of
“changing the history of this country”
The first official session of the assembly kicks off the one-year-long process of writing a new constitutional text. In mid-2022, Chile must vote for another plebiscite to approve or reject it. Currently, the Constitutional Convention has some important immediate tasks. First, they will have to define the internal regulation. Second, their own confirmation and the possibility of extending the board of directors to ensure greater political diversity. Lastly, they will have to evaluate the Convention’s budget.
This new direction Chile is taking can be deepened by the election of a new president. The future candidates are already selected. There are three favorites: Sebastian Sichel, from the right-wing alliance Chile Vamos; Yasna Provoste, from the center-left Christian Democracy (and the only woman in the election); and the young congressman Gabriel Boric, from the left-wing bloc Apruebo Dignidad. In addition, smaller campaigns such as far-right José Antonio Kast and center-left Marco Enríquez Ominami, can threaten to siphon off votes from the front-runners. In November, Chileans will also vote for new Parliament representatives – 27 of 55 senators and all 155 seats in the Chamber of Deputies – who can legislate over new equitable plans.
All eyes will be on the left and center-left – currently out of government – to see if they can win this election and transform popular discontent.

"France’s Anti-Covid Strategy: Compulsory Health Passes, Mandatory Vaccination, and Limitations on Human Rights","President Macron’s anti-Covid measures have raised a high number of protests inFranceand sharp accusations of violating human rights.Mandatory vaccinationandhealth passesare among the most contentious initiatives.
This situation led to discussions and research on the causes for vaccination-hesitancy, as well as on the proportionality of the government’s strategy to fightCovid-19. In effect, the questions remain: why is there so much hesitancy towards the Covid-19 vaccine? Is it justifiable to preserve public health and fight a worldwide pandemic through the infringement of fundamental rights?
On the 12th of July of this year, given the emergence of the Delta variant and its exponential propagation, President Macron announced a stricter anti-Covid course of action. It involved the following measures:
These measures were the result of a low vaccination rate that was threatening a deeply desired social recovery and putting the vulnerable population seriously endangered in the face of a new, unknown, and rapidly spreading variant.
On the one hand, this announcement led to a boost in the booking of vaccines’ appointments all over the country. On the other hand, it led to an increasing number of protests and complaints. Indeed, many are of the opinion – especially those in the opposition and theanti-vax movement– that this course of action represents an attack on personal freedoms and extreme abuse of power.
France is, apparently, one of the mostvaccine-scepticalcountries in Europe. An aspect that, according to some, has its roots in the past and is worthy of investigation. In effect, it is this hesitancy that inevitably leads to harsher preventative measures.
Understanding this reluctance can pave the way for different strategies to fight the pandemic that won’t provoke antagonism against governments’ restrictions of some fundamental rights. To that end, it is indispensable to untangle and understand why people are, in the first place, unwilling to take the vaccine.
Firstly,there isscientific uncertaintyregarding the duration of the immunity period and the vaccines’ efficiency to limit transmission. Coronavirus’ nature and effects are ongoing research. This prevailing uncertainty creates a climate of insecurity. In effect, it is fundamental for people to have access to all the relevant information about the vaccine in order to make informed decisions, without being indirectly impelled to do it through government measures that might intensify feelings of distrust and anxiety.
According to some,the 2009 Swine Fluwas an impactful event that negatively moulded France’s perspective on vaccination. At the time, “millions of superfluous jabs were prescribed raising millions of euros to the industry behind it” which created a climate of scepticism around vaccination that might explain the current reluctance towards Covid-19 vaccines.
TheRECOVER Social Sciences and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)developed a study that evaluates public opinion concerning Covid-19 vaccines in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine. This brief is valuable to understand why there is so much reluctance in accepting the vaccine and to, eventually, create new conciliatory strategies that will dispense the infringement of fundamental rights.
The brief states that the mistrust against Covid-19 vaccines is less about not trusting healthcare workers and medical practitioners and more aboutnot trusting pharmaceutical companies and the financial gains behind the vaccination campaigns. The study also demonstrates that even if the vaccine was proven safe and free of charge, only “between 44% and 66% of respondents would accept to be vaccinated”.
That said, neither the incident of the Swine Flu in 2009 nor the conditional approval or the uncertainty of vaccine’s side effects can be blamed for the low number of vaccinated citizens. The vaccines being free of charge and proven safe may not be enough to encourage mass vaccination.
Katherine Eichelbaum, in her research essay,Is mandatory vaccination an unjustified violation on human rights?, debates the psychology of anti-vaccination thinking. Even though her study refers to childhood immunizations, it can be linked to the current pandemic. Eichelbaum adds two other reasons why people might be discouraged to be vaccinated: one is what the author considers ‘misinformation’, which alarms people by exaggerating some side effects the vaccine might provoke. The second isthe high number of individuals who chose to rely on herd immunity instead of taking the vaccines themselves.
In other words, the hesitancy and uncertainty lurking behind Covid-19 vaccines are impeding herd immunity; “which only occurs once a (relatively high) threshold of a given population is inoculated against each preventable disease”. Herd immunity is essential to fight the pandemic efficiently with the least number of victims.
In short, if there are not enough people vaccinated against the pandemic, public health is seriously at risk which, in turn, leads to severe measures that might have to interfere with human rights.
According to Eichelbaum, a vaccine can be defined as “the suspension of attenuated or killed microorganism (bacteria, viruses or rickettsiae), or of antigenic proteins derived from them, administered for the prevention, amelioration, or treatment of infectious diseases”. When we are vaccinated, an external agent is being inserted into our body which, inevitably, affects bodily integrity.
If mandatory, France’s measures will infringe not onlyArticle 8of theEuropean Convention of Human Rights(right to respect for private and family life), which implicitly includes the right to refuse medical treatment, the right to bodily autonomy, and the need for informed consent; but alsoArticle 5(right to liberty and security) since it is inextricably linked to ideas of freedom from any interference with one’s bodily autonomy and integrity.  However, according to the ECHR, the public authority may interfere with these rights in the “interests of national security, public safety (…) for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”.
Moreover, the imposition of health passes violatesArticle 2of the Protocol Nº 4 of the ECHR (right to freedom of movement). But then again, restrictions to this freedom might be necessary and proportionate when in “accordance with law and are necessary in a democratic society (…) for the maintenance of order public, for the prevention of crime, for the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”. Adding to this, mandatory vaccination might breachArticle 9of the ECHR (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion). Nevertheless, this freedom, once again, “shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and necessary (…) for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”.
At last, it is important to mention how these infringements are at odds with the states’ obligation to protectArticle 2of the ECHR (right to life). This right is of the utmost importance when considering the proportionality and justification of anti-Covid-19 measures that restrict some human rights and freedoms. Indeed, the Right to Life asks for a negative and positive action of the states, and the latter refers to the states’“primary duty to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life”. The Covid-19 pandemic and the refusal of some to be vaccinated for non-medical reasons make it difficult to achieve herd immunity which, in turn, threatens the life of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Furthermore, André den Exter from Erasmus School of Law, in the articleMandatory vaccination in childcare and its relevance to COVID-19, maintains the claim that “the right to private life does not only include an obligation to abstain from unlawful interference in a person’s private life but, simultaneously, includes a generally recognized positive obligation to protect the life and well-being of others from health risks”.
Exter analysed the case study ofVavřička and Others v the Czech Republic, which has been thoroughly connected to the debate on the Covid-19 vaccination strategy. This case was submitted to the European Human Rights Court by a group of parents from the Czech Republic. They objected to paying a 400 euros penalty for not having vaccinated their children and, also, for having their unvaccinated kids excluded from preschool, and claimed that their right to private life was being violated. At last, the European Court decided that there was no violation of ECHR’s private life since it is not an absolute right and, therefore, “restrictions can be allowed when justified”.
The outcome ofVavřička and Others v the Czech Republiccase demonstrates how compulsory (not forced) vaccination can be justified in the presence of apressing social need, even if there is no certainty of its efficacy, and especially when vaccine hesitancy is increasing.
Even though there are significant differences between childhood immunizations and Covid-19 vaccination programmes, –  the former concerns diseases that are well studied by medical science, and, besides, the Covid-19 vaccine is not yet approved for children –  this case study has been discussed thoroughly to demonstrate that a compulsory Covid-19 vaccination could be lawful as long as considered necessary and proportionate in the interest of public health and safety and the protection of others’ rights and freedoms.
The questions remain and there is no simple and clear-cut way of providing an answer. Indeed, the world is experiencing an unprecedented situation that has led to immediate and often-improvised responses.
Given the urgency and critical times,these actions had to restrict some fundamental rights. For instance, if before ‘freedom of movement’ was ever more restricted by compulsory quarantines and lockdowns for a greater good, now France’s mandatory health passes and vaccination (the latter applies to part of the population, namely, health and care workers) is the government’s approach assumed to better and more effectively fight a pandemic that has proven to be extremely unpredictable and fatal.
Undoubtedly, it has its disadvantages. The strong discontent and dissatisfaction in the country reflect that. Nonetheless, these controversial conditions are raising important discussions and debates which are crucial and utterly useful not only for the moment we are living but also to any future circumstances that might demand conflicting and difficult decision-making.

[ANALYSIS] Multi-level Politics in Argentina,"Argentinian democracy has been classified as a“flawed democracy”in the 2021 Global Democracy Index. Although the consolidation of a bipartisan coalition party system has given balance to the national arena inArgentina, the subnational level has its own dynamic, where the “strongmen” of many provinces have reportedly bent the rules of democracy to tilt the playing field in their favor.
But first, it is quintessential to analyze the characteristics of Argentina’s federal system and its effects ondemocracy.
The Argentinian Constitution was signed by provinces that pre-date the Argentine nation, giving them a long-standing legitimacy. The current system includes23 provincesand the capital city of Buenos Aires – each one of them has its own legislative organ, its own supreme court, and most importantly, its own constitution. These constitutions allow the provinces to choose their own authorities without the intervention of thenational government. While on paper this may seem reasonable by allowing provinces to retain autonomy, in practice this autonomy can easily translate into abuses of power, and, in some cases, to the construction of a feudal-style state.
At the political level, there are24 provincial party systemsthat compete for positions of power.
In the case of national elections (presidential or legislative), the provinces are their own electoral district. Usually, as the provincial party leader, it is the governor who chooses the representatives and senators for the national chambers. However, this can give provincial strongmen the power to use their votes as a bargaining chip for extra resources; if the chosen legislators do not deliver on the governor’s demands, they can simply exclude the names of the rebel congressmen in the next election – ruining their political career.
With such a diverse and complex political scenario, it’s no surprise that the levels of democracy within Argentine provinces tend to differ so much from one another.
The fragmentation and de-nationalization of party politics in Argentina generate the need for agreements between several actors, which sometimes adds a high level of instability to the decision-making process due to the competing interests of political actors.
At times, this complex decision-making process ends up cornering presidents, as they must contend with many different, contradictory demands. When this occurs, it can appear as though the only way to successfully reform policy is to raise the president’s voice and suppress other political actors, which has occasionally led to authoritarian positions.
This was the case with Carlos Menem’s presidency and with the Kirchner governments, where,through the discretionary distributionof soybean export surplus incomes, the Kirchner couple was able to reward loyal governors and punish dissidents at the provincial level.
The Argentinian Congress is divided into two branches: theSenatethat represents the provinces (three senators per province and the capital district), and theChamber of Deputies(with one representative for every 33,000 citizens to be updated every ten-yearcensus).
The problem arguably lies in the flat rate of representatives per province, despite their widely varying sizes and populations (see graph below). This causes a distortion in the representation of the provinces, which is especially damaging to the Buenos Aires province – the biggest in size and population – and disproportionately benefits small (typically with poor democratic standards) districts like Formosa, Santa Cruz, and Tucuman.
Small districts with a smaller population and strong leaders can have a lot of influence in legislative debates. This can create a temptation for members of the executive branch to use their influence to sanction their own laws, especially given the carrot and stick dynamic that exists between governors, senators, and representatives.
The consequence of this amplification of influence in small districts is reflected in the distribution of resources between the provinces. The national government and the sub-national provinces first divide Argentina's tax revenue equally between themselves and the provinces then divide their half between the 24 districts in a fixed percentage.
This way of dividing resources is deeply damaging to the finances of a province like Buenos Aires, which despite providing services to 40% of the country's population and producing almost 40% of the national GDP, receives only 20% of the taxes raised by the government. The major part of these resources instead goes to""rent-seeking""provinces that then become fully dependent on them. This generates a dual economy with provinces that act as free riders, while the sub-national state becomes the only motor of the economy.
When approaching the subject of multi-level politics from an international perspective, one can already identify a lack of multi-level analysis.  In fact, the focus of a great part of international analyses has been on analyzing the economic interactions between transnational companies and national states, avoiding analysis of how government systems (federalist or unitary) could have a considerable impact on political-economic negotiations. Moreover, globalization should be understood as a dynamic process where economic changes are more common than before.
In many cases, international media can have significant blind spots when it comes to understanding states, as they cannot perceive the internal specificities that impact the political, economic, and social spheres. Nowadays,globalizationhas permitted numerous channels of transition where national and local governments interact at the same time with important transnational companies and non-profit organizations. This makes it very important to observe the economic and political relationships between provinces and other important private sectors. As a result, understanding and analyzing how federalism can shape political and economic dynamics requires a strong definition offederalism.
Federalismcan be understood as a particular political dynamic in which national, provincial, and local governments interact simultaneously, while also having the autonomy to legislate in certain areas.China´s 'multi-tiered' approach in Latin Americaprovides an interesting case study on federalism. Not only has federalism encountered certain difficulties in terms of managing theCOVID-19 pandemic, but it has also sparked considerable debate around the sub-national and territorial politicking between presidents, governors, and municipal mayors in the structuring of commercial, financial, and joint cooperation agreements.
Over the last twenty years (2000-2020),Chinahas been vigorously expanding its financial and economic ties withLatin Americaand the Caribbean. According to Harvard's Atlas Economy of Complexity, and as we can see in Graphics 1, 2, and 3 below, there has been significant growth in exports toAsiaand China, particularly in three strategic trade partners:Argentina,Brazil, andUruguay(the three most significant actors in the Southern Common Market [MERCOSUR]).
Since the early 2000s, most Latin American countries have been experimenting with this trend towards increased ties with China, as can be seen in the graphs below. This trend is important to consider when analyzing how negotiating dynamics are managed within the political systems, both unitary and federally.
The gradual growth of Sino-Latin American ties has also been created by a series ofofficial documents and bilateral meetingsbetween a wide range of actors. So far, over the course of the twenty-first century, China has written two important white papers, in 2006 and 2016, which have drawn Sino-American linkages closer and embedded economic and soft power sources. Both documents represent points of inflection due to the emergence of decentralized economic negotiations.
In the image below, it is evident that Chinese engagement has become highly decentralized in Latin America in three particular moments. The multi-level approach favored by the Chinese can be understood as a useful tool for increasing their negotiating capacity. By pursuing decentralized negotiations, China was able to avoid the legal and political obstacles in the electoral cycle, which typically go against projected results. This was the case with the last two Argentinian presidents:Cristina Fernandez de KirchnerandMauricio Macri. As both presidencies struggled to maintain a mandate, which made it difficult for legislation to be passed, the position of China was to establish a multi-level approach between local governments and the local private sector instead.
Put simply, the current multi-level approach of China in their dealings with Argentina has been very important.  The possibility of three different levels of government in Argentina, even during problematic economic and political situations, can make the timing and speed of political and economic projects complex, diverse, and, at times, cause unexpected national results. This makes the case of Argentina very useful in understanding how multi-tiered Chinese diplomacy can represent a timely opportunity for state-state negotiations. In fact, Argentina has been a large recipient of important, strategic Chinese investments.
According to the University of Boston, Chinese banks (such as Exim Bank, CDB, and ICBC) already have a strong presence in the Argentinian provinces of Jujuy, Santa Cruz, and Cordoba. In Jujuy, China built the most important and largest solar park in Latin America as a result of a series of negotiations between the provincial bureaucracy and the Argentinian/Chinese private sectors (without the presence of the Argentinian national government).
Moreover, the emergence of these projects has been feasible due to the existence of political rigidities, in particular, projects among national governments. As a result of these tendencies, federal states, like Argentina, with three levels of power (national, provincial, and local powers) make economic and political agreements more difficult, which can lead to conflicting interests, for example, between the national and provincial governments.
In a certain way, the Chinese multi-level approach to diplomacy represents a useful tool forimproving the results of economic negotiations. This is even true for Argentinian provinces that have a large amount of critical natural resources, and their strategic position can bring about important results. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), South America and a large part of the Andean region have extraordinarywind and solar potential, which could improve its current energetic matrix, production, and research (our reportexplores in depth this topic).
On the other hand, it is crucial that these countries consider the potential dangers of the internationalization of Chinese companies and banks (such as CDB, EIBC, and ICBC) and the development of a“resource-seeking”strategy. Latin America and its political sphere must be on the alert to this regional tendency. Each country and regional institution (CELAC and MERCOSUR, for example) should define a clear middle-term development plan. As Carol Wise, an expert of Sino-Latin American relations, writes:
""The task ahead is to work smarter andmore efficiently on the China relationship, while simultaneously tacklingthe backlog of pending reforms on the domestic front""
The political reality of countries that rely on decentralization and fragmented federalism are easy prey for economic superpowers with a hunger for natural resources. The lack of bargaining power of the Argentinian national government makes the powerful rulers of the subnational states susceptible to the influence of foreign countries which pay very little for natural resources and have little or no environmental controls, making it very difficult for national governments to enforce a unified international approach.
Further, the key position of local governors within the exploitation of natural resources can encourage countries like China to skip negotiations with the national government and start negotiations with these often cheaper decision-makers. This is all aggravated by the lack of hard currency in Argentina due to inflation, which causes the incomes of provinces to fall every year and increases the incentive for them to negotiate internationally.
Finally, the globalization of economic ties, both formal and informal, has resulted in deep complexities among sub-national units in federal government systems and other actors, including nation-states and multinational corporations. The economic weight of the People’s Republic of China is widely recognized, but it is important to observe how this multi-level approach to diplomacy can shape national territories, political dynamics, and political economy. The Argentine experience clearly demonstrates that this can result in over-dependence on larger state actors as well as a poor democracy.","January 09, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-multi-level-politics-in-argentina/,Joaquin Gomez Amato,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"Political Crisis and Peronist Realpolitik: “Alberto Fernandez for Government, Francis J. Underwood to Power”","In the Netflix series “House of Cards,”Francis Underwood, the fictional Vice President of the United States played by Kevin Spacey, turns his face to the camera and says: “There are two types of Vice Presidents: Doormats and matadors. Which do you think I intend to be?”.
This ruthless pragmatism applies to the institutional crisis of the last few weeks inArgentina. After two years of government, theCovid-19 pandemic, and spikes in inflation, the Peronist coalitionFrente de Todoswas bitterly defeated by the right-wing coalition Juntos.
The collapse was so dramatic for the government that they even lost in its historic electoral strongholds, such as Chaco, Santa Cruz (the district where the Kirchner marriage was politically born), and Buenos Aires “the mother of all battles” due to its size and population.
Even though these elections were the primaries, where society chooses between several candidates within each party, and although the final match will be played in November, the setback activated an old mechanism in Argentine politics known as the search and destroy of the “Marshall of defeat”.
The first move was made by the Vice President,Cristina Kirchner, who, according to the press, met President Fernandez after the election with the intention ofchanging the course of the governmentandforcing a replacementof the entire presidential staff.
However, her requests were denied by the Head of the State, who argued that the main districts where the coalition was defeated were Buenos Aires and Santa Cruz (both ruled by the Governors of Mrs. Kirchner’s inner circle). Following this line, the President could not be accused of being the “Marshall of defeat”. Besides, the executive claimed that a change of staff would leave a weakened government if there were similar results in November.
The quarrel got dirty, and the Vice President left the Presidential palace empty-handed. However, Mrs. Kirchner turned out to be – in Underwood’s own terms – no “doormat,” but a “matador.”
Three days after losing the election, Kirchner held her posture by making her loyal henchmen in Santa Cruz and Buenos Aires ask for the resignation of their entire cabinets. The queen put the king in check, but the President kept his stance.
The next day, one of Cristina’s loyalists, the Minister of Interior, Eduardo “Wado” de Pedro, presented his resignation via Twitter. In the following hours, resignations were presented one after another, and entire staff members of several ministries were ready to abandon their positions in obedience to the Vice President’s command.
This offensive was not answered by the President; the third night ended with tepid declarations, reaffirming that the national cabinet would not be changed.
At noon, four days after the election, people ate lunch while reading a statement by the Presidentvia Twitter, where he affirmed his authority in the management of the government, calling the Argentines to dialogue, and soliciting the unity of his political front.
His call for unity was bombarded by “filtered” audio of a Peronist Member of Congress, Fernanda Vallejos, a strong member of the Kirchner faction, who mocked the President for being a “squat”, “whippersnapper”, “clown” and a “sick man”.
She also stated:
“This man who thanks to Cristina is sitting there in Rivadavia’s chair [Presidential chair] has no merit to be there. He must surrender to what Cristina says, because Cristina is the representation of the Argentine people, and the Argentine people speaks through her mouth. Not through Alberto Fernández, not through Guzmán’s [Minister of Economy] a**hole”.
This rhetoric violence was ignored by the Presidential office. But the inner circle started to discuss a possible way out of the political battle with a new staff that left every member of the coalition happy.
The night of the fourth day after the election, Cristina Kirchner turned the table with aruthless letter. She accused the President of ignoring her views about the social crisis, and the fact that she knew the election was lost before it had even happened.
She lashed out against the presidential spokesman, Juan Pablo Biondi, accusing him of propelling media operations against her. This accusation ended with the resignation of the closest advisor of the President.
The ball was in the air as the political media said President Fernandez was seriously evaluating the possibility of breaking the government and expelling the rebel functionaries. Misgovernment and anarchy would probably become the “new normality”.
Behind the scenes, someone who acted in favor of institutional normality, and who helped maintain the cohesion of the political coalition, was the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Sergio Massa. Once a fierce opponent of the Kirchner government between 2013 and 2019, with good relations with the United States and the corporate world, the leader of this Peronist faction acted as a mediator between the two parts and was successful in advancing an agreement that left the Argentines with the sense of a delicate truce, when it all seemed lost.
The work of political articulation of this political actor isn’t new. The Congressman has found help in moving the government’s legislative agenda by working in tandem with the son of the Vice President, Deputy Maximo Kirchner. His ideological pragmatism and contacts gave him the necessary flexibility to mediate the conflict and end the crisis.
Finally, after an entire week of political unrest,the President changed his staff. Many saw the move as a sign of weakness, but when we dissect the new ministers, we cannot say it was a full Kirchner victory. In spite of the fact that the changes were done when Cristina demanded, the names of new functionaries do not resemble the left-wing coalition Frente de Todos presented in 2019.
The President was also able to keep his Minister of Economy, Martin Guzman (disciple of Stiglitz and negotiator with the IMF), and his Minister of Production, Matias Kulfas, who were both very resisted by the Kirchnerist faction.
The new chief of staff, Governor Juan Manzur, rules one of the most conservative provinces in Argentina. He was recently sued by the Ministry of Women and Diversities becausehe forced an 11-year-oldto have a baby without granting her legal right toan abortion. By U.S. standards, this would be like having a pro-life Texas Governor as the chief of staff of a Democrat administration.
But the Governor is an expert in Argentinian politics, as he worked in the most complex hot areas of Buenos Aires province, as well as Health Secretary in La Matanza (one of the biggest and poorest districts). After that, he became the National Minister of Health and was finally elected as the Governor of Tucuman province. His profile is of a strongman in administering poor areas, and he also presumes an excellent relationship with Israel and the United States.
For the newcomers to the land of the Pampas, Peronism, as Frank Underwood implies, is a party of power where “ruthless pragmatism” prevails, and ideology is just a canvas upon which leaders paint what the people want to see.
To conclude, is this truce going to blow into pieces again if the result of the primaries repeats in the general election? ​​Hard to say, but what we can affirm is that the Argentine political confrontation has something valuable in the Latin American context, and it’s the fact that the crisis has remained inside the political system. There was no attempt or threat to democracy as we saw recently in Brazil or El Salvador.
Maybe if our readers live in parliamentary systems, they might see this “crisis” as something “normal” but as political scientistJuan Linz affirms, an institutional architecture that uses fixed terms of duration in charges like presidentialism, cannot put up with the flexibility this type of crisis demands.
The political dynamic, and the high-speed decisions of the different players in the political game, make it impossible for any analyst to produce accurate predictions and interpretations. However, as we say in Argentina, “It is always good to fish in troubled waters”.

[REPORT] Evolution of Women’s Rights in Turkey: The Fall of a Democracy,"Within the aftermath of the First World War and the arrival of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in Turkey, the instauration of a new republic based on modern, western values came as a necessity. Indeed, in 1923, the founder wished to establish a new and progressive Turkish Republic. Henceforth, Ataturk renounced the old standards of the country as he believed in modernization. This change in morals was notably carried out in favor of the improvement ofwomen’s rights.Indeed, as the state modernization project enhanced by Ataturk’s reforms was based on women, the government promotedgender equalitywithin the public sphere.Women represented a tool of the state’s mutation. InState Feminism, Modernization and the Turkish Republican Woman, Jenny White defined the feminist state as
“a male-dominated state that made women’s equality in the public sphere a national policy.”
Hence, the republican government started to define what modern women should incarnate. The new Turkish republican woman is“unveiled, educated, socially progressive, urban and has to behave in what the stated defined as modern”. These modernist transformations incarnated themselves in the emancipation of the feminine part of the population. They became the image of a“new common civilized way of living”.
Legal reforms started to pave the way for women’s liberation. In 1926,Islamic laws were replaced by a secular civil code, giving women more rights. Turkish women were granted the right to vote in 1934. One year later, eighteen women took full part in the decision-making process by being elected to the Grand National Assembly. Thus, the implication of democratic reforms implemented prior to 1923 has taken on the democratic aspects by ensuring universal suffrage.
Women’s rights were considered an imminent condition for the instauration of the new Turkish Republic. Thus, the instrumentalization of the role of women was a major pivot in the transformation of Turkish society. The establishment of its democracy was notably rooted in theimprovement of women’s legal conditionsand thus the abolition of a society solely divided by gender.
In the early 1980s, the young Turkish democracy was fortified by theflourishing of secular feminist civil-society movements. Indeed, women gradually “became involved in activism”, according toTekeli(1995), and after the coup of 1980 women’s NGOs began to gather.
The emergence of independent networks was used to “maintain stability” after the military putsch that occurred on the12th of September, 1980. An apolitical atmosphere marked the aftermath of the coup. This left room for the emergence of civil societies networks, including one of the secular women’s organizations. These networks had time to organize themselves into structureswithout fearing government pressure.
Feminist networks started to raise concerns regarding domestic issues and were filled with a strong desire to question the gendered nature of Turkish society. Considering the lack of political debate on women’s rights issues in the private sector, secular feminist organizations became aware of the complementarity of their actions to those of the leaders.
They were critical of the gendered nature of their civil rights and called for reforms. Thus, the notion of lobbying became a necessity and was used as a means to gain influence.Feminists became political entrepreneursserving a cause. Since the pluralism of opinion is a fertile ground for democracy, Turkish civil society was playing an important role in consolidating it. Therefore, the modernism ofTurkeywas accomplished under the yoke of the expansion of feminist civil societies.
In December 1999, Turkey was officially been accepted as a candidate forEUmembership. Henceforth, a Europeanization process started to come into effect in orderto comply with EU democratic values.Within the redefinition of Turkish norms, women’s organizations contemplated the opportunity to extend their influence within civil society. Indeed, women’s NGOs started to seriously pressure the government to“alleviate the gender discriminatory laws”. For instance, theWomen’s Working Group on the Penal Code(WWG) initiated dialogue with the high political sphere. A legal battle emerged when women’s associations found themselves in the position of combatants.
Actions for reforms in favor of women’s rights began to gain ground, notably with the suppression of Article 438 of the Penal Code; a law that previously reduced a rapist’s sentence if the victim was a prostitute. Seeing the light at the end of a legal tunnel formed by gendered, discriminatory laws, more and more Turkish feminist NGOs called for reforming the Turkish civil code.
According to theWWHR, the new civil code, passed in November 2001, was the embodiment of a founding change in favor of gender equality and the improvement of women’s rights, once set aside. Indeed,the reformed civil code abolished the supremacy of men in conjugal unions.It also established the full equality of men and women“with respect to rights over the family abode, marital property, divorce, child custody, inheritance and rights to work and travel”.
In terms of democracy advancement, the constitutional reform of 2010 was seen as a genuine turning point. Indeed, a constitutional amendment’s referendum was held in 2010 and has beenaccepted by 58%, to comply with EU standards. The package of 26 constitutional amendments was meant to improve freedom, women’s rights, as well as restructure the high judiciary courts.
Thus, the EU accession process has been enhanced by the progress of adaption of Turkish law,‘marking the period of democratization and rights-based reforms’.
In line with the EU enlargement process, Turkish women’s organizations considerably broadened their influence. Indeed, they benefited from the collaboration of other European feminist NGOs. By recognizing the importance of civil society, the Turkish government will further its EU application procedure and has helped buildlearning cooperation with European feminist organizations.Hande Eslen-Ziya and Nazli Kazanogluexplained that Turkish civil society and particular feminist organizations “saw it as a bridge between Western feminism and Turkish feminism”.
Therefore, the Europeanization process has had considerable influence on the expansion of women’s rights through the Turkish legal system. The consolidation of women’s civil society incarnated thefirst step of Turkey’s entry into the EU. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the period of acceptance of Turkey as an official EU membership candidate and the proliferation of women’s rights pursuant to the constant efforts of Turkish NGOs to demand the re-establishment of the women’s equality project.
After Turkey’s disappointment regarding its status as an EU-member state, AKP’s popularity rose sharply. Erdoğan’s government won the 2011 general election by a large majority. His rise to power was accompanied bya new conservative, nation-centered revival.
Due to the reluctance of the ruling party to continue building the EU accession project, a considerable turn in democracy-building occurred. This retroversion has been the fertile ground forweakening efforts to improve the cause of women. Hande Eslen-Ziya and Nazlı Kazanoğlu define De-democratization as “the weakening of human rights, more specifically the weakening of gender equality discourses “. Such a definition could be compared with the De-Europeanization process. Symansky defined it as the“loss of democratic quality, experienced by countries that modify their regime from democratic to non-democratic”.
This de-Europeanization process has been escorted by a certain determination to de-construct policies implemented accordingly with EU standards such as the one on women’s rights.
It appears that in the new Turkish era, driven by the AKP government, the understanding of women is based under the umbrella of family. After the 2000s, Turkey enhanced theprotection of conservative and religious valuesas well as neo-liberal policies while favoring‘motherhood behavior’. According to President Erdoğan, giving equal status to women and men would run counter to their fitrah: the ‘God-given nature.’ This statement, which appreciates the conception of a divided and gendered society, shines a spotlight on the implication of patriarchy. Indeed, it seems that gender equality, a fundamental principle of human rights, is against nature, this the decline of women’s rights under the‘New Turkey’has been in effect.
A certain gap between theEuropeanization process led by policy reforms, and the reality of Turkish women’s rights have become more and more visible. The World Economic Forum’s2016 Global Gender Gap reportranked Turkey as 130 out of 144. The lastreport of Freedom house 2020, testifies theunderrepresentation of women in positions of powerwithin the AKP government. Hence, in the last parliamentary election in 2018, women won 104 seat,s which put their presence around 17 %. In light of those rankings and despite the considerable legislative efforts to renew Turkey’s image by making it a master of progressivism, a paradox began to emerge.
This mindset change emphasizes women’s roles as mothers, wives, and sisters. To protect the family vision ofTurkey, the paradigm of domestic violence has shifted. The ruling government considered diminishing domestic violence protection to disincentivize women from seeking a divorce. In 2016 the parliament recommended that“women should prove their partner’s violence to receive extended police protection”.
Turkey’s government does not seem to see violence against women as a problem of inequality. It is rather considered to be a potential threat to the domestic equilibrium. The failure to make efforts to end violence against women manifests itself as aviolation of the Istanbul Convention, officially known as the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, adopted in 2011. Turkey was the first signatory as well asthe first one to withdraw from iton March 20, 2021.
On 25 May 2012,PresidentErdoğanequated abortion with murdersaying, “there is no difference between killing a baby in its mother’s stomach or killing it after birth.” Regarding this statement, Mustafa Akyol said that “politically this will serve him” since most people living in Turkey are against abortion. This turn on the structuration of Turkish society goes along moreIslamic conservative lines at the expense of women’s rights.
In his opening cannonade against abortion, President Erdoğan also claimed that abortion was
“part of a plan to hold back Turkey’s population from growing and be part of the world’s top 10 economies by 2023”.
Indeed, women can fuel that economic rise by having “at least three children”, the Turkish president said. Erdoğan’s government has paved the way for constant acceleration of population growth where women are purely playing a maternal role. Within the economic motivation of Erdoğan, the place of women is fundamental in the sense that it actuates procreation.
According to Alexander Christie-Miller, women are considered to be determining factors to weigh in the balance of global competition. President Erdoğan’s efforts to reduce access to abortion were meant to protect Turkish society from Western deviances. Henceforth, the Turkish government led a campaign to banabortion. This campaign was not successful due to the resistance of feminist organizations which all came together to protest the decision. Thus, in theory, the government did not question the 1983 law authorizing abortion. In practice, however, under pressure from the Ministry of Health, many public hospitals stopped performing abortions. Across Turkey, “only 7.8 percent of the total of 431 public hospitals perform abortions” announcedKadir Has University study.
Abortion inTurkeyhas become a state matter, loosening the conservative philosophy of the government. Women’s bodies are being manipulated with the sole purpose of serving the government’s determination to curb Turkey’s falling birth rates. In hisinterview Pouvoir et Savoir with Hasumi, Foucault gave the definition of power as a form of truth;
“Truth (…) is carried under the effect of multiple forms of constraint. Each society has its own regime of truth: that is to say, the types of discourse it accepts as true.”
In the case of the current Turkish government,conservative norms and thirst for economic power are the truth. Foucault mentions the fact that the omnipresence of power results in ‘the dressage of bodies’. Thus, the so-called knowledge of the government forcibly penetrates the mentality of the individuals whose bodies must submit to it. The abortion case study highlights the willingness to conform women’s bodies to the discourse of truth of power. Henceforth, the instrumentalization ofthe female body is at the service of the conservative and religious conception of the state.
The fundamental freedom of women to make choices about their own bodies comes into conflict with the interest of the state. Inevitably, this collision violates the democratic principle of independence between the provisions of legal power and government ideologies. Democratic consolidation implies the process of freezing democratic norms. By calling into question the right to abortion, the government is carrying out a process of norm change that considerably endangers Turkey’sdemocracy.
A strong democracy finds its roots in a developed and pluralistic civil society (lobbying, information asymmetry, judicialization tactics, etc.). As analyzed earlier, the reform of Ataturk gave the opportunity to women to express themselves as individuals. The advancement of Turkishfeminismfrom a group’s perspective toward a more individual-oriented conception allowed women’s networking strategies to gain a major place within civil society. The implication of the de-democratization process that followed had acatastrophic impact on secular feminist organizations and on the rights obtained by and for Turkish women.
In the light of the importance gained by the pro-government women’s organization, the hardening of the conditions of feminist organizations became evident. Hence, to achieve the regeneration of a country based on the fusion of conservative Islam and nationalism, the government launched a collaboration with civil society women’s organizations. Those are“often co-founded by relatives of AKP leaders”. The multiplication of these collaborations has resulted in a tacit agreement between women’s movements and governments that have agreed ideologically. The creation of the KADEM (Women and Democracy Association) aimed at preserving traditional gender division within Turkish society. A splendid coincidence considering that it isthe President’s daughter, Sumeyye Erdoğan who runs this organization. Once KADEM was founded“it slowly blocked the communication between the government and secular women’s organizations.”This authoritarian drift involves the homogenization of opinions and the stigmatization of criticism.
Following the public affront of the prominent feminist Pinar Ilkkaracan denouncing KADEM as the‘government’s fake civil society organizations‘, the president’s daughter filed a lawsuit against her. Thus, in addition to crushing feminist organizations, the government discredits the voice of the opposition. They also prevented them from having a separatist impact on the political scene.
Since debate and confrontation of ideas are necessary for the good health of democracy, the homogenization of the conception of feminism endangers its values of freedom. By empowering pro-government women’s groups, the tendency of the government to silence and, indeed,ignore civil society,is symptomatic of the repressive and authoritarian drift that Turkey is undergoing.
A breakdown of the dismantling process of the Turkish democracy is presented below.
Women’s roles and status have always been a fundamental pillar for the construction of different political projects in Turkey. There is an intrinsic relationship between the rights allocated to women and the current political situation. Hence, the stability and expansion of women’s rights remain a determining factor in assessing the consolidation of democracy.
Whenever Turkish democratic principles are threatened, women’s rights suffer the consequences from it. Given this feature,Turkeycan no longer be considered a democracy, but as a fallen one.

Haiti is Shaking: The Impact of the Last Earthquake on the Vulnerability of the Country,"On August 14, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struckHaitileaving more than 1,200 people dead and more than 5,700 wounded. The impact was disastrous in every aspect, with the destruction of many buildings including houses, schools, hospitals, and churches, as well as the displacement of thousands of people. To make matters worse, three days laterTropical Storm Grace hit the country, bringing heavy rains and mudslides into the already affected area. This worsened the impact of the earthquake, leaving no time for rescue and recovery.
The country was left completely devastated and unable to react, withhospitals incapable of treating the survivorsdue to poor infrastructure and the impact of the earthquake. The urgent need for medicine, food, water, and shelter activated international aid and support from all over the world, but inaccessible roads and collapsed bridges complicated aid, preventing people from reaching the most remote areas.
These natural disasters contributed to the already precarious situation in Haiti. To truly understand the situation, we have to go deeper and investigate Haiti’s pre-existing vulnerabilities, which include environmental, political, economic, and social factors.
Considering thepolitical situation, Haiti is now in the middle of a crisis, culminating in the recentassassination of President Jovenel Moïseone month before the earthquake. Haiti’s political instability is historic. Crime and insecurity are norms, with multiple armed gangs alternating between outwardly opposing and infiltrating into the government. Endemic corruption and incompetence have consistently characterized the national government, and the Moïse administration was no exception. The recent assassination has reinforced this condition, leaving the country in an institutional vacuum lacking authority.
Theeconomic situationis no better.Once the wealthiest colony in the Americas, Haiti is now the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, amplified by economic stagnation, debt, and dependence on international aid. The2019 economic downturn, which resulted in a lack of basic services such as food, water, and fuel, has left 59% of the population under the poverty line, 24% of which are in extreme poverty. Recent events such as popular protests, a presidential assassination, and natural disasters have placed further pressure on the country’s economy.
One of the most serious results of Haiti’s economic stress and extreme poverty is poor health. The population suffers from poor health conditions due to malnutrition, poor hygiene, and lack of basic necessities. Moreover, public health lacks essential supplies, infrastructure, and personnel. The healthcare system is constantly impacted by natural disasters making it nearly impossible for it to ever fully recover,COVID-19has dealt a significant blow as well, pushing hospitals that were unprepared to fight the pandemic to the verge of collapse and leaving the population particularly vulnerable to the virus.
Besides general instability and poverty, Haiti has been even more negatively impacted by its natural environment. Some call it the “Haitian Curse“; located along a geological fault line and in a region exposed to severe weather, Haiti is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards, especially floods, droughts, earthquakes, and hurricanes. The history of earthquakes goes back to the18th century, with the first big earthquake reported in 1751. On top of its vulnerability to earthquakes, climate change is also putting the region under further stress by causing extreme weather events to become more frequent and intense.
All of this is worsened by the limited preparedness and poor economic conditions of the country.Poorly planned urbanizationcontributes to environmental vulnerability, with a large portion of the poorer segments of Haiti’s population creating settlements in illegal, disaster-prone areas. When natural hazards occur, the weak infrastructure does not stand. If the state does not invest in mitigation and prevention, the “Haitian Curse” will continue to bring pain to the country.
Considering the previous earthquake that occurred in 2010, which left a profound mark on Haiti, it is useful to make a comparison to understand what has changed and what the former disaster taught the country.
In terms of intensity, the recent earthquake was 0.2 stronger than the one in 2010, which was a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. Despite this, the consequences for the environment and population were much more drastic in 2010, with220,000 dead, 300,000 injured, thousands of buildings collapsed, and more than 1 million people displaced. This is mainly due to the difference in location. While the 2010 earthquake struck the capital of Port Au Prince, this recent one struck Haiti’s southwest Tiburon Peninsula, which is more rural and less densely populated.
But even if this earthquake was better in terms of location and intensity, the 2021 earthquake put a strain on the still-open wounds of the previous one, from which the country has yet to fully recover. Clearly, the outcome of a natural hazard is not only characterized by its environmental features. The disaster resilience of Haiti correlates with a given natural hazard’s outcome, with less intense events causing more intense consequences and vice-versa. Two main mistakes were made during this intermediate time: not only has the population been left alone, unable to recover from the last earthquake, but the state has not learned from the 2010 earthquake, making no relevant investment in emergency planning or infrastructure standards. Moreover, the worsening of the current political and economic situation plays a role in the effects of the 2021 earthquake.
The historical experience of natural hazards can be used constructively by a country, teaching it to increase its preparedness in terms of disaster mitigation and risk prevention. This is the case inJapan, whose historical exposure to strong earthquakes has resulted in a push for investment in resilient infrastructure and high-speed recovery measures, making earthquakes not as much of a threat to the country. For Haiti, this is not the case. The political instability and economic stagnation did not allow the country to invest in resilience against constantly occurring natural disasters.
As we understand, every aspect of Haiti’s vulnerability is linked, and each of them worsens the other. Environmental harshness reduces the already poor health and economic status of the population. This, in turn, hinders the country’s ability to mitigate, anticipate, and prepare for environmental disasters. Therefore, it would be limited and misconceiving to link the precarious conditions of Haitians exclusively to the recent earthquake. This is a product of a historical evolution that involves political, economic, and social components, as well as the “Haitian environmental curse” that contributes to the country’s deterioration.

Politics of Ransomware: A Latin-American Approach,"Earlier this year, United States DHS Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas,statedthat ransomware has risen to be considered anational securitythreat. These comments rekindled an interest in cybersecurity issues, drawing special attention to the damage cyber-attacks can have on a political level.
Ransomwareis a type of malicious software that infects a computer and restricts users’ access to it until a ransom is paid to unlock it. Variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert. Typically, these alerts notify users that the system has been locked or that files were encrypted.
Traditionally, ransomware targeted companies and consumers only as the attacks are carried out primarily for profit-based motives. Although this still remains true, they are evolving, targeting governments worldwide. Last year alone, 2,400 US-based public-sector entities were affected with payments totaling 350 million dollars.
Nevertheless, ransom attacks do not solely translate into financial costs for governments.Critical infrastructure, loss of public data by encryption, and national health systems are also at risk.If developed countries seem to be struggling with this phenomenon, where areLatin-American countriesstanding and how can they undertake the threat of ransomware?
In Latin America, the most common attacks are associated with data leaks. Just acouple of weeks agothe information of more than 1 million military servicemen and women of various national defense agencies were leaked. The data purports to contain the full names, civil status, gender, precise address, telephone numbers, email, and rank of the affected individuals.
A similar incident was reported in August 2019 when hackers leaked 700 GB of data including confidential documents, wiretaps, and biometric information from the Argentine Federal Police.In the same year, theArgentinegovernment acknowledged a ransomware attack that restricted 7,700 GB of data.
In the current scope of things, there aretwo ongoing issues. The first one islegislation. In Latin American countries, regulations over cybersecurity and cyberattacks seem good in theory, but not in practice.
Within national strategies, there is a tendency to raise awareness about the dangers of online spaces, with calls for international cooperation and an emphasis on the importance of building robust security architectures; yet this awareness rarely translates into public policy. For example, the creation of the Argentinian Information-Security Committee in 2005 was followed by a 9-year gap until the Joint Cyber ​​Defense Command (which primarily responds to containing the availability and integrity of critical infrastructures) was founded.
When it comes to cybersecurity the “natural pace” of policymaking falls short. Another obstacle is the overlapping nature of cyberspace, which spawns into anattribution-retaliation dilemma: who is responsible for the attacks and how should victims react?
Since hiding traces is relatively easy for perpetrators, attribution in ransomware attacks is highly difficult. When attempting to work out who may be behind an attack, analysts assess two things: indicators of compromise (IoCs) and attackers’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, attacker infrastructure, like IP addresses and domains, can be easily forged or generated in a manner which will shield their real identity. Ergo, it is not uncommon that an important number of attacks happen anonymously.
After an attack, the “victim” country needs to assess the capabilities, intentions and characteristics of potential aggressors and only then decide if it is worth announcing the findings of a security breach and its alleged responsibility.
This scenario causes great danger for states, because deciding to retaliate can be a political bargain if the perpetrator is not confirmed. Specialists still debate about whether the retaliation of cyberattacks has to happen within the cyber realm or in a kinetic way, especially if the perpetrator remains unknown.
The attribution-retaliation dilemma has led to question of whether cyberattacks are a matter of defence or national security; or both. Most Latin American systems make the distinction between two different types of regulations for National Defense and National Security. Hence, this entitlement issue can deepen countries’ vulnerabilities when it comes to ransomware attacks, simply by being unclear about who should act upon them.
According torecent studies, in the first semester of 2021, Latin America suffered more than 91 million cyberattack attempts. These studies indicate that ransomware is showing a steady increase in frequency. The average weekly ransomware activity in June 2021 was ten times higher than a year ago.
The telecommunications sector was the most targeted, followed by government institutions and the automotive and manufacturing sectors. This data shows that ransomware remains a very present risk for all types of organizations, regardless of industry or size.
The fast changing pace of cybercrime calls for quick action. Regional cooperation and aligned regulations seem like a good alternative to prevent cyberattacks and ensure the cybersecurity of states. In particular for Latin American countries, which may not have the resources or structures individually, a regional system that shares cybersecurity capabilities could reduce ransomware risks and attacks.
Currently, the closest thing to a regional approach is theInter-American Cybercrime Cooperation Portalsteered by the Organization of American States (OAS). However, it is not a political strategy of international cooperation. Instead, it seeks to strengthen hemispheric cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrimes. Therefore, it deals with the crime once it already happened and does not create policies of prevention.
Regional organizations such as OAS or Mercosur can be of great use as they already have a history of successful multilateral cooperation. Developing a regional policy in cybersecurity issues can be fundamental to prepare and prevent the political and economical costs of ransomware.

Great Britain’s Energy Failure: Poor Economic Structures Lead to Crisis,"This November, manyBritonswill be seeing their first or second extraordinary energy bills as winter rears its bitter head and homes grow cold. While winter creates a familiar dent in many British pockets due to increased heating bills, this year the dent is closer to a chasm.Energyprices are soaring with both supply-side and demand-side forces pushing the energy market close to collapse.
Energy prices are increasing globally, in particular for natural gas. Last winter’s cool temperatures and lockdowns put pressure on supplies, meaning this year’s gas station supply is lower than normal;around 22.9 billion cubic meters below normal. This is coupled with increased demand fromAsia, but perhaps the more pressing issue is the litany of poor economic structuring of the past decade due to privatization and Conservative rule.
Among structural problems at the basis of the phenomenon,The Economistreports the following:
Withgas prices up 250% since January, Great Britain finds itself significantly in the weeds.
Both homes and businesses are being directly affected by increased energy costs. In September, Britons will remember seeing plenty of headlines about meat shortages across the country, caused by the closure of CF industries, an American-owned fertilizer company responsible for over half of Britain’s CO2 supply. Due to increased energy costs, the company announced it was shutting down operations in September, creating disastrous effects for the meat industry who relies on CO2 for the processes of food production.
The Economist reported that on the 21stof September, the government met and agreed to subsidize CF Industries’ energy prices to the tune of“many millions”according to the Secretary of State for Environment, George Eustice MP. In fact, CF Industriesreported a profit of $246 million in the second quarter of 2021, a 29.5% increase from its $190 million profits in the second quarter of 2020.
Great Britain’s energy market needs restructuring away from dividends, large salaries, and million-pound subsidies, but it does not look like the government will be going in this direction any time soon.
Great Britain’s dependence on natural gas may be the reason it continuously chooses to subsidize the fossil fuel industry, so much so that in the 2015 and 2016 financial years,it gave more money to oil companies than it received in taxes, according toits own official statistics.
The government’s persistent support of the fossil fuel industry is leading it into conflict on both national and international levels. In 2021,Paid to Pollute, a UK-based NGO, launched a legal campaign against the government, specifically against the Oil and Gas Authority’s new strategy which states that the sector has a “legal duty to maximizeeconomic recovery”of oil and gas.
Campaigners are concerned that this phrasing leaves room for uneconomic operations to be propped up by subsidies, potentially even the construction of new sites. Not only would this framework not be ‘in the best interests of the UK economy and taxpayer’ but it would also directly conflict with the government’s ‘leveling up’ commitment and promises of a transition to a low-carbon economy.
Giving such economic freedom to fossil fuel authorities is worrying not just for UK campaigners, but also for international organizations. In 2021, the UN’s Human Rights Council extended the mandate for itsSpecial Rapporteur On Human Rights And The Environment titled ‘Safe Climate’. Within the document, the rapporteur mandates that:
‘To address society’s addiction to fossil fuels,all States should: (a) Immediately terminate all fossil fuel subsidies, except for clean cookstove programs.
The26thConference of Parties, hosted by the UK government up in Glasgow, was expected to readdress the essential requirement for all governments tostop subsidizing fossil fuels, especially at such enormous levels, and comply with the UN’s mandate. As of writing this article, PM Boris Johnson is yet to address the issue to fellow nations, but he is unlikely to admit to Britain’s fossil fuel subsidy problem, as the government has consistently adopted the public position that it does not subsidize fossil fuels, point-blank.
He is able to deny such accusations because ‘a significant part of the subsidies identified by the commission is the 5% rate of VAT on domestic gas and electricity, cut from the standard 20%’. Phillip Hammond, the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, has admitted the government had‘“forgone” billions of pounds by choosing not to implement a scheduled rise in duty on petrol and diesel’: this fuel duty freeze alone amounts to around £46 billion in revenues from2011 to 2019. The table above, provided by Bloomberg Green, showcases just how much of such subsidies are ‘post-tax’.
Great Britain is not only stuck in a structural energy problem near a predictable collapse, but it is also heavily embroiled in some harmful environmental practices, all based around its energy consumption practices. Its current position is not sustainable.
A positive future of British energy would be less dependent on imported, non-renewable fuel, and instead be manufactured in an environmentally sustainable way either on British soil or out of the influence of volatile global energy markets. A top-to-bottom restructure is necessary, and hopefully, in the next few winters, warm homes will not be so costly to Britons, and to the environment.","December 16, 2021",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/great-britains-energy-failure-poor-economic-structures-lead-to-crisis/,Clara Browne-Amorim,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The ‘Al-Shabab’ Nightmare in Somalia,"Al-Shabab (‘Youth’ in Arabic) is a radical Islamic terrorist group inSomaliathat sprung up from the ashes of the Union of Islamic Courts. The Union held power in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, in 2006, before eventually being forced out by the Ethiopian army. Al-Shabab wants to impose a strict Islamic theocracy in Somalia, and its insurgents are adherents to the Saudi Wahhabi religious movement, despite most Somalis identifying as Sufi Muslims.
According to Roggio and Gutowski, Al-Shabab’s long-term goal is“to overthrow local governments and create emirates which will eventually coalesce into an Islamic caliphate“. Al-Shabab has been condemned as a terrorist group by both the UK and the US, with the latter offering $6 million for information leading to the successful capture of its leader Ahmad Umar ‘Abu Ubaidah’.
Al-Shabab has pledged its allegiance toAl-Qaedaand has ties withNigeria’s Boko Haram, despite cold relations with theIslamic State(IS). It refused to pledge allegiance to IS in 2014, and it sees IS as a threat to its hegemony in Somalia and its recruits, with 20 Al-Shabab insurgents defecting in 2015. Moreover, IS has started to recruit from within Al-Shabab’s ranks to obtain experienced members. This, coupled with the contrasting goals of Al-Shabab and IS, has caused a stand-off with the terrorist group, with many fearing the outbreak of a three-way war between IS, Al-Shabab, and the African Union (AU) forces.
The group controls much of the rural regions of southern Somalia, despite it being officially ousted from Mogadishu in 2011. Attacks in the city still occur to this day, such asthe 2017 truck bombing that killed at least 500,the deadliest bombing in East African history. One of the most recent bombings,this time in a tea shop, killed 11 soldiers and injured a further 16 on the 14thof September 2021.The group has had recent successes in retaking strategic locations such as Amara early in 2021, after a brief interlude of government control in Al-Shabab’s 10 year-long occupation of the town. When a region comes under Al-Shabab control, the group installs its own administration through the imposition of taxes and Shariah law. Many living in the capital still pay protection taxes to the group. Under Al-Shabab control, stoning and dismemberment are common punishments for adultery and thievery, respectively.
Recruits typically come from Somalia and neighboring countries, but it also counts EU, UK, and US nationals among its ranks. Many return home from the diaspora to join Al-Shabab’s cause.Membership estimates range from 7,000 to 9,000 combatants, including children.Al-Shabab has enjoyed popularity and high recruitment rates in Somalia, which can be said to stem from the security that the group offers in such an unstable country.
Somalia has had no effective government in the last 20 years; the northern provinces of Somaliland and Puntland have declared independence and autonomy, respectively. Despite this, Al-Shabab’s reputation in the country has been worsened by its refusal of Western aid during the Somalian drought and famine of 2011. According to inside sources such as Ak Amin Kimathi, a Kenyan Human Rights lawyer who was wrongfully imprisoned with Al-Shabab militants after the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, the group’s main method of attracting recruits is through faith-based arguments.
Hesaysthat:
“they are given quotations from the Koran, the Hadiths [Prophet Muhammad’s teachings], but they do not have the benefit of a critical mind to look at it in any other context and they trust the people driving them to this”.
In Kenya, recruitment has been done through financial means. Slum-dwelling young boys are offered cash sums of $1000 to join the terrorist organization.While this cash injection offers short-term security, it often leaves dependent family members without a breadwinner, thus creating a vicious circle of poverty and subsequent recruitment. Yet, recruitment success rates remain high due to rampant youth unemployment in the country. Defectors have reported that they would not have joined Al-Shabab if they had been employed.
Furthermore, the distrust between slum-dwelling Muslims and the national police force hampers efforts to reduce terrorist recruitment as families refuse to share possible vital information with officials, feeling that police officers unfairly target Muslims with searches and arrests. This has led to a situation in which it is estimated that one-quarter of Al-Shabab’s members are Kenyan. Kenyan recruits smuggle arms across the border, bribe guards, and hide grenades amongst food hampers so that insurgents can carry out attacks.
Individuals are radicalised to believe that Al-Shabab is correct through arguments that they are wrongfully persecuted by AU forces. Revenge is a key motivator for major attacks. Furthermore, the group preys on young people’s feelings of inadequacy, and it radicalises them with promises of importance through martyrdom.
Among these recruits,there may be up to 1,000 members operating as spies,feeding information to the group’s infamous ‘Amniyat’. The ‘Amniyat’ is essentially an intelligence network within Al-Shabab that also functions as a control mechanism. It is responsible for intelligence gathering, counterintelligence, assassinations, security, health, finances as well as planning terrorist attacks both within and outside of Somalia.
Defectors believe that the only way to escape Amniyat’s grip is to seek refuge abroad. Due to their importance in the operation, they are also better paid and better connected.According to Hussein Sheikh Ali, the former National Security Advisor in Somalia,
“The Amniyat is the veins of the organisation. It is all-powerful. If the Amniyat was destroyed, there would be no al-Shabab”.
The ‘Amniyat’ utilizes diverse methods to maintain this control. It is known to use women to carry out operations, including finding safe shelter, providing food, moving tactical objects, and delivering messages. It also is an incredibly clandestine group, with its lower-ranking members not knowing the names of other members and cells not knowing the plans of other cells.
Al-Shabab’s resilience has been credited to be due to the Amniyat’s ability to hide within plain sight in government-controlled areas.

Kanal Istanbul: A Story of Dangerous and Controversial Megalomania,"“We see Kanal Istanbul as a project to save the future of Istanbul … to ensure the safety of life and property of Istanbul’s Bosphorus and the citizens around it.”
These were the words of the Turkish PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoganin June 2021, at the ceremony of Sazlidere Bridge, discussing the planned route of Kanal Istanbul. Since 2011, Erdogan has been pushing for the construction of a new canal to link the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. He hopes the proposal will bring prosperity toTurkeyby, among other factors, reducing traffic on the Bosphorus Strait, generating new revenue, creating jobs, and building a new hub where life can develop and flourish in the capital. However, this project has been vastly criticized by the public and poses major concerns in a multitude of spheres from the environment to the geopolitical balance of the region.
In order to understand the importance of Kanal Istanbul, one must look to the history and geography that surround the region.
The Bosphorus Strait is situated in the heart of Istanbul, where it separatesEuropeandAsia, is the sole water linkage between the Black and the Marmara Seas. In conjunction with the Dardanelles, it is the only waterway to link the Black Sea, to the Mediterranean and, consequently, to the world. It comes as no surprise that it is a highly crowded strait, thus anchoring its position on the world stage, both in the trade and political spheres. Who controls the Bosphorus has a privileged position over international trade.As a way of illustration, in 2019 around 41,112 vessels carrying a total of 638.9 million gross tons of cargo passed through this notoriously narrow strait.
Its singular position, in essence, means that the Bosphorus constitutes the only way for nations of significant weight, such asRussia,Bulgaria,Georgia,Romania, andUkraine, to reach the Mediterranean by sea. As such, its strategic importance dates back millennia, to the 5th century BC and the city of Scythia, extending to the present day and has been the stage of major conflicts most notably during the Russo-Turkish War and World War I.
In 1936, in order to regulate and address the long-running question of who and how the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles should be regulated and controlled, the major powers of the time signed the Montreux Convention, which was later registered next to the League of Nations Treaty Series. The convention, still in force, institutes the core principle of Freedom of Passage by stating inArticle 1that “[t]he High Contracting Parties recognize and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by the sea in the Straits”.Article 2similarly holds that “[i]n time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo.”
Regulating both merchant and military vessels, the convention puts the control of the straits and their crossing in the hands of Turkey. It authorizes this State to impose restrictions on military ships and bar the passage of merchant ships, including those belonging to states currently at war with Turkey (Articles 4 and 5 of the Montreux Convention). Restrictions from size to cargo capacity are imposed on military vessels, impairing, to a significant extent, the crossing of this type of ship, most notably with regards to non-Black Sea nations. Furthermore, though the convention restricts Russia, the most prominent Black Sea nation, in sending military ships to the Mediterranean, it also ensures that no outside forces can enter past the straits, therefore ensuring Soviet dominance of the region.
It is, in essence, this balance of forces that the proposed Kanal Istanbul is accused of threatening. Insofar as the convention does not refer to this new waterway, it cannot be said to regulate it, meaning that apart from the ability of Turkey to impose charges in its crossing, a possibility that Erdogan openly tends to exploit, it also allows for freer movement of military ships in and out of the Black Sea. In all, the restrictions imposed by the Montreux Convention do not apply to the new canal.
Though cautious,Russiadoes not seem to be particularly concerned by the project. According toAleksei Erkhov, the Russian Ambassador to Ankara, the Montreux Convention would not be changed by the construction, and as long as that remains true, Kanal Istanbul is merely a Turkish matter. Economically speaking, the new canal would not stop the free passageway in the Bosphorus, leaving the choice between the waterways to the discretion of companies and their cost-benefit analysis. Traffic-wise, and, most importantly, in terms of military concerns, the new canal does not infringe on the Dardanelles strait, the crossing of which is necessary to reach the Mediterranean and vice-versa. Erkhov stressed that, even if it were to be of concern, the project is bound to be “very long term” and regardless, the legal regime imposed by the convention limits not only the crossings through the straits but also the number of vessels and amount of cargo within the Black Sea (see Article 18 Montreux Convention).
Even though no direct threats to Russia’s dominance over the region may arise, nothing can be said to the effects it might have on the geopolitical relations of the Black Sea powers.Boris Dolgov, a Senior Research Fellow of the Center for Arab and Islamic Studies of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has cleverly pointed out that Russia’s foreign policy and interest may change with the new canal.
He highlights the fact that Russian troop supply in Syria is carried out through the Bosphorus and a new canal may hinder or divert that. Similarly, it has been theorized that the canal may be a way for Turkey to excuse a withdrawal from the Montreux Convention, with the new waterway being just another puzzle piece in Turkey’s plan to become a central power and further enforce itself in the region, bolstering its influence and expansionist goals. The canal would also create space for pretensions, like the one demonstrated by theUSAduring the 2008 Russia-Georgia crisis, to augment outside military power in the region. This situation is currently being prevented by the convention.
Firstly, it seems important to mention that the project has been said to cost around $20 billion. However, taking into account the collaterals of, for example, displacement and reconstruction of highways, roads, water pipes, power lines, entire neighborhoods, etc. the cost is said to average$250 billionwhich clearly poses monetary challenges. Major Turkish banks are part of the Global Sustainability Pact, and the immense environmental implications of the project will create barriers the access to these funds, not to mention that recent Private-Public Partnerships, used to build new infrastructure all over Turkey, have definitely put a strain on the government’s pockets.
Such a big project is also bound to originate some type of corruption schema. Many are speculated to benefit from land around the canal’s planned route, both with personal and political ties to Erdogan and Turkey’s government at large.Around 60% of the area within the boundaries of the canal is private property.
Environmentally speaking, we are talking about a project thatwill pass through wooded areas that house major freshwater sources that have supplied Istanbul since the 17th century.Furthermore, the Kanal is likely to upset the natural equilibrium of the currents and counter-currents of the Black and Marmara Seas, turning it into a tube where polluted water from the Black Sea may reach the Mediterranean. Whole ecosystems and the sustainability of endemic species are bound to be disrupted, in what seems to be a clear violation of the Bern Convention which the country is a part of.
As for the population of Istanbul, there seems to be general discontent and disapproval. Public opinion surveys, conducted by independent research institutions have corroborated this.Despite being painted by Erdogan as the crown jewel of a vast list of public mega-project, public resistance seems to only focus on the negative impacts, the majority of which are outlined above.","March 09, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/kanal-istanbul-a-story-of-dangerous-and-controversial-megalomania/,Luis Matos,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
North Korea to receive supplies from the World Health Organization,"Despite North Korea’s reports of zero cases ofCOVID-19, the country has finally accepted to receive external aid through the World Health Organization.
North Korean secrecy is nothing new to external observers, so government reports of zero cases of COVID-19 in 2021 are hardly shocking. This data’s veracity, although received by the World Health Organization, cannot be assumed to be reliable, and while many countries have COVID-19 testing systems that underestimate the true number of cases,the hermit kingdom’s assertions that COVID-19 has not reached North Koreaseem bizarre. According to the North Korean government,in September 40,000 North Koreans were tested for COVID-19, but all tested negative for the virus.
Despite these strange assertions from its leader Kim Jong-un, the country is receiving humanitarian aid to help fight the virus. The WHO’s representative to North Korea, Edwin Salvador, has even said thatthe DPRK government has developed a plan for when the vaccination program can begin. This plan has been created through collaboration with the United Nations.
Furthermore, the country has been closed off from the rest of the world since the start of the pandemic; its borders withChinaandRussiaclosing in order to keep the virus at bay. This has come at the cost of the country’s economy, which has been saidto have suffered greatlydue to the complete shutdown of external trade. This shutdown has also hampered anti-COVID efforts within the country itself, withanti-bacterial hand gel having to be smuggled in. So severe were these restrictions that North Korearefused to allow its athletes to compete at the Tokyo Olympic Games– despite every other country in the world attending – for fears that the athletes may come into contact with the contagion and infect the country.
This paranoia and fear shown by the country completely contradictits refusal to receive 3 million Sinovac vaccinationsto be distributed to the population, countering the offer with the assertion that there are no cases of COVID-19 in North Korea, and that the vaccines would be better used in worse affected countries that cannot afford vaccinations.
Observershave noted that this posturing may be a ploy to receive ‘better’ vaccines due to rumors of inefficiency and blood clotting from the Sinovac vaccines. It has also previouslyturned down offers from AstraZeneca, citing the same reasons. The idea of an international ploy is likely due to this rejection, which coincides with the expansion of North Korean nuclear testing sites.Observers have identified this as a signthat the country is about to pressure the international community into providing humanitarian aid.
While the country remains silent and little news escapes its borders during this intensified self-isolation, anti-COVID resources such as emergency health kits, medicine, and medical supplies for essential health servicesremain quarantined in the port of Namphoafter arriving through Dalian, a Chinese port city close to the North Korean border.
There has been no update on their condition nor their location, so it is impossible to know whether these supplies have in fact reached North Korea. The hope lies in the opening up of shipping routes between China and North Korea in recent weeks, but Kim Jong-un’s regime remains as unpredictable as ever.

Poland Challenges the Principle of Primacy of the European Union law: the Conflict that Raised “Polexit”,"Last October, Poland’s constitutional court ruled that its national constitution takes precedence over the legal jurisdiction of theEuropean Union(EU). The Polish ruling challenges the principle of primacy of EU law, according to which, in case of collision between national law and European law, member states must defer to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). As a response, the EU held off on approving the 23 billion euros in EU grants and 34 billion euros in cheap loans to help Poland recover from theCOVID-19 crisis. In addition, the CJEU slapped Warsaw with a fine of 1 million euros per day, the highest ever to be imposed.
The Law and Justice Party (PiS), the largest political party in the Polish parliament, has been at odds with the EU concerning LGBTIQ and women’s reproductive rights, migration policy, the COVID-19 pandemic, and judicial reforms. Even though the EU’s popularity in Poland is, as surveys suggest, significantly high,‘Polexit’is, to many, a not-so-distant possibility.
Poland is often considered an“in-between state within the EU field of power, a state that occupied neither top nor bottom position in the field’s hierarchical structure”.Furthermore, Warsaw has been at odds with Brussels over matters such as themigration crisis, LGBTIQ and women’s reproductive rights, thepandemic, and the rule of law. Lurking behind each of these tensions is the resistance of the Polish state to acknowledge the power of the European Union in Polish domestic affairs.
PiS won the parliamentary elections in 2015, on the cusp of the migration crisis, which was a source of disagreement between Warsaw and Europe. Poland blamedGermany and European Institutionsfor creating this crisis by inviting migrants and expecting member-states to ‘share the burden in the form of national relocation quotas.’ The party leader of PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, stated at the time that Polandhas not opened Europe for refugees,but Ms. Angela Merkel.
“And it is Ms. Merkel and Germany that have to bear the consequences, not Poland.”
A migration crisis took place on Poland’s eastern border in the last months. A mass influx of middle eastern refugees arrived at the Polish eastern frontier, sent by theBelaruspresident, Alexander Lukashenko, in response to the EU sanctions imposed on Belarus. Polish NGOs have claimed that Poland sent these migrants back to Belarus in a violent and illegal manner under EU law. Poland is also suspected of refusing the entrance of journalists, NGOs, or any sort of civilian aid. Warsaw denies these accusations.
In the 2019 parliamentary elections, the far-right polish party,Konfederacja, secured almost 7 percent of the votes. According to the Konfederacja party’s agenda,‘gender’ and ‘LGBT’ ideologyare deemed as threats to traditional Polish and Christian civilization. They accuse LGBTIQ people of pedophilia, Christianophobia, and having intentions to destroy cultural traditions and the Polish Church. Since 2012, the Polish Catholic Church and some ultra-conservative organizations have campaigned against sex education, the ratification ofthe Istanbul Convention, and women’s reproductive rights.
From 2019, several Polish municipalities and regions adopted resolutions on the creation of so-called‘LGBT-ideology free zones’,which goes against the EU core values of equality and respect for human rights. Consequently, theEuropean Commissionrequired “adequate and comprehensive information from the Polish authorities.”Although the Polish government denied having discriminatory laws against LGBTIQ people, the European Commission considered Poland’s response to the inquiry as unclear and inappropriate. In July 2021, the European Commission started legal action against Hungary and Poland for violating the fundamental rights of LGBTIQ people. Asstatedby President Ursula von der Leyen,
“Europe will never allow parts of our society to be stigmatized:be it because of whom they love, because of their age, their ethnicity, their political opinions, or their religious beliefs”.
The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the factors that incited Polish leaders, such as Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, to affirm the lack of action by the EU. Justice Minister Ziobro has even stated that the EU’s“inefficiency and lack of understanding of the key challenges facing Europe are yet another shameful proof of EU’s utter disgrace”.
Moreover, these leaders declared that the EU failed to face the pandemic efficiently, accusing the EU of not helping Poland or any of the EU members in an outstanding way. The Polish leaders also asserted that the EU merely offered flexibility in funds that were already allocated to member states. In sum, Polish leaders believe the pandemic turbulent times clearly confirmed the importance of the Polish nation over the Union.
Poland challenging the principle of primacy of EU lawintensified an ongoing quarrel Poland has been opposing over the years: the alleged inequality between EU member states. In essence, this conflict is about power dynamics within the union and the extent to which it can intervene in the national affairs of its members.
Ever since PiS came to power, it has been accused of reorganizing the traditional judiciary system, allegedly replacing constitutional judges considered ‘too liberal’ with party loyal conservatives and establishing a legal chamber with “the authority to discipline judges and prosecutors.” The European Court of Justice questioned this rule and obliged the Polish government to respect the principle of independence of judges. As a response, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki asked the Constitutional Court to decide on the supremacy of EU law over national Polish laws in July. That autumn Poland’s court ruled that some EU laws infringed on the Polish constitution, and, therefore, the sovereignty of the country.
In the words of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS,“In Poland, the highest legal act is the Constitution and all European regulations that are in force in Poland (…) must comply with the Constitution. This also applies to the judiciary and the European Union has nothing to say here.”
This conflict is utterly significant. Not only because it questions the place of Poland in the EU and a possible ‘Polexit’, but also because it challenges core values of the EU, which are allegedly unclear to certain member states. Besides, it raises doubts on the span of EU law primacy, on the existence of double standards within the union, and, finally, on the competencies ascribed to the ECJ.
Joining the European Union is an act of sovereignty from each member-state.They accept the limitations on their power and declare to respect the EU treaties. When joining the EU, each member state is required to undergo a transition phase that consists of the revision of the legal system, including the States’ constitution, in order to harmonize it with EU treaties.
Accordingly, when entering the EU, member states are familiar with the principle ofprimacy of EU law. For instance, if a state’s national law, including their constitutional law, collides with the EU primary law, the latter takes precedence. Being part of the EU is a conscious and intentional decision. Its implications are introduced in the beginning. Member states know they are required to have independent judges, and Poland chose to abide by these laws in 2004.
The EU is being accused of double standards seeing as other member states have stated that their national law takes precedence over the EU law. Germany is the most recent case, but many others have occurred within the EU. According to Dave Keating, the Brussels correspondent for France 24, there is a significant difference between the Germany and Poland cases. In Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling was about the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program, considered illegal under German law. While Germany’s judicial independence was never questioned, in Poland’s case, the Constitutional tribunal’s judges are being accused by the EU of having been politically appointed, and of refusing to follow EJC instructions on the independence of justice.
Article 5 of the EU Treaty declares that “[u]nder the principle of conferral, the Union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the Member States in the Treaties to attain the objectives set out therein”. This article has been often mentioned in defense of Poland’s actions in the conflict. Even though it is clear, from the moment a member state joins the EU, that the CJEU is the ultimate arbiter and the top level of the court system, this issue unveiled uncertainties regarding the competences belonging to CJEU. This undetermined character makes it complicated when conflicts like this arise. If it is unclear what the treaties declare, could it mean it is time for another revision?
After the ruling, thousands of poles across the country went to the streets to demand to stay in the EU.Surveys suggestthat more than 80 percent of people in Poland are happy in the EU, therefore, ‘Polexit’ seems to be a very distant reality.
Contrary to what the leader of the opposition, Donald Tusk, affirms, both Mr. Morawiecki and Jaroslaw Kaczynski insist that the so-called ‘Polexit’ is fake news and that Poland wants to stay in the EU. However, the conflict brought about existential anxieties for the union. This rebellion highlights the fragilities of the EU with some claiming that this conflict jeopardizes theEuropean projectas it could incite a ‘snowball effect.’ Moreover, given the harsh sanctions imposed on Poland, there is a high chance the Polish government could blame the financial and internal problems it will face on the EU.
In short, this existential European crisis, incited by Poland’s contestation, might instigate, even though unlikely, structural adjustments in the European project. These could include revising the treaties, reconsidering a European constitution, and even creating mechanisms to expel member states that continuously disrespect the core values of the union. However, the CJEU is going to decide on the affair and the most likely scenario is for it to become court jurisprudence serving as a reference for future analogous cases.

[ANALYSIS] The Entropy and Multiplication of Risks: The Last Period of Globalization?,"Since 2008, the international system has experienced a series of economic, political, and health-related setbacks. Today, the relationships within this system are critical for understanding where and what the future trends may be. The 2008 financial crisis, the proliferation of viruses, and the increasingly fragile democracy in many Western and Latin American countries are important lessons to consider and analyze in conjunction.
Given the widespread confinement that thestart of the COVID pandemichas caused, although later the experimentation and the constant dilemma of governments between opening or closing their geographical limits, prompts us to reflect on the repercussions within the world economic architecture. An outstanding pattern, subject to this endless coming and goings was the blockade and the inoperability of the main world harbor. The traffic jams were such that maritime transport (which brings together almost 80% of global merchandise) disrupted the global economy.
Schematically, the international system has been signed for “political (the emergency of illiberalism at the heart of the stakeholders’ system), geopolitical (the rivalry between China and the United States), andentropic tendencies such as climate change and CGV’s disruptions” (Actis 2021) that have brought on several important consequences. Recent events, such as the debt crisis of one of the most important Chinese real state agencies, Evergrande, strong fluctuations in prices due to a series of lockdowns in ports of vital importance to the world economy, such as Shanghai, the energy crisis in Great Britain, and considerable increases in oil costs will have important impacts on future costs and projections.
Where are we going? How should we analyze it? When can we track the origin of this kind of globalization? Can the COVID outbreak help us understand?
There is nothing like a crisis to clarify things.
If the international system has suffered several changes – for example, the drop in trade volume, environmental impacts, and the regionalization of production – the powerful COVID-19 outbreak could bring important lessons to analyze. The Green Swan – “disruptive events linked to environmental, sociodemographic and environmental health imbalances” (Actis 2021 and BIS 2020, 3) – is a useful conceptualization that can help us understand how uncertainty is the rule in this current international system.
The COVID-19 outbreak has been wreaking havoc in different but pronounced ways throughout the entire world. The virus has introduced what former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once warned about: the importance to differentiate “the known unknowns and unknown unknowns events” (Actis and Creus 2020). In short, the virus is “a chronicle of a pandemic announced”(Sarukhan 2020). COVID-19 is a phenomenon we know very well from near and distant historical experience, but global society, despite previous studies on the probability of the outbreak of a new epidemic, was not prepared in terms of forecasting, calculation, logistics, and capacity to face the crisis.
There have been several epidemics that have greatly impacted the world, as we can see in Graphic 1, and concern for future pandemics has come from several sources. One example isThe Global Trends 2025, an official document of the Office of the Director of the National Intelligence Council of the United States. Further, the warning of the joint investigation group of the World Bank and the WHO is another example. To be precise, the COVID-19 outbreak has not only exposed “the acceleration of preexisting tendencies” (Haass 2019) but also highlighted the uncertainty of the global system, which pretends to be increasingly global, diffuse across borders, with several localized power centres, but is not treated with enough importance by policyholders.  The proliferation of climate risks, the disruption, and relocalization of global chains values, as well as the impact of the multiple and differentiating velocities of technological advances both between and within countries, expose a common denominator: the entropy and risks of the current global system.
There are two features of the current global system: deep economic, social, and political integration and risks between countries, international companies, and the wide range of non-state transnational actors in the current global system, and an exclusive focus on the Sino-American dispute.
After the decline of the Soviet Union and the emergence of multiple pro-democratic and market theories such as the “End of History”, The United States’ guidelines have been very clear: the imminent proliferation of democracies, economies-markets, and the extensive liberal component. Towards the beginning of the 21st century, the global system changed abruptly; the presence of China as the second-largest economy in the world, the emergence of non-state actors – like terrorist groups, transnational companies, and international NGOs – and the totality, liquid, and fleeting nature of economic, social, and political flows explain entropic bipolarism. According to Schweller (2014), we observe how “the diffusion of power” (Nye 2011) is understood as the multiplication of economic productive centers of power. As a matter of fact, this tendency towards the proliferation of powerful non-state actors converges with a marked bipolarism between the United States and China – two factors that can explain the disorder and the risks that the current international system can bring. Moreover, the capacity of traditional states to manage the economic, social, and political risks is almost nonexistent due to the globalization of risks and flows.
To understand this global system more clearly, we can use the “entropic” (Schweller 2014) notion to refer to the disorder, proliferation of risks, and potential threats. All of these aspects are results of the globalization of productive matrices and the ecological, social, and political derivations or bifurcations that occur. As a matter of fact,  entropy refers to “the negative philosophical and normative view of complex interdependence” (Actis and Malacalza 2021). While interdependence and its different channels of transmission have always been associated with the opportunities to maximize costs and improve relations, the current entropy process reflects a complete condition of disorder where the lack of coordinated responses and the proliferation of multiple agendas are the law.
In this context, concepts like “risk societies”(Beck 1992) or “entropy” (Sweller 2014) are useful in order to understand the current stage of globalization. Despite each analytical lens, all reflect a doubled movement, while the risks climate, economic and social increase, the future is less and less clear. The restructuring of entropic bipolarism – the doubled moment where the disorder, risk, and uncertainty of the globalization process combines with the great concentration of  economic, technological, and financial capacities from the United States and China – brings a series of challenges that it is critical to the question:
Ulrich Beck (1999) warned of international anomie when he explained how globalization “generates new uninsurable risks that exceed the state capacity to face them”. In fact, the low degree of joint capacity within the liberal-international architecture reflects a process of “organized irresponsibility” (Beck 1992), that is, “there is scientific knowledge that informs the risk and uncertainty, but collective management or assurance against these risks is waived with the necessary resources, policies and institutions’‘ (Sanajua 2020). There are several useful practical instances to observe the complete disorganization of multilateral responses, for example, the global health architecture such as WHO and COVAX’s fund. There was a clear lack of informative transmissions about the origin of the pandemic at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak and the provision of joint state actions to moderate the pandemic impact. Further, There was a strong asymmetric degree of access to vaccines in African and Asian countries according to data from Our World In Data.
What will the future of the areas of multilateral discussion be? Will they continue to be marked by electoral political pendulums, joint forces, or mechanisms that will be defined that outline a series of minimum but necessary common objectives?
The emergency that the COVID-19 virus has, once again, put into discussion shows the scope and risks of an interconnected system. Even now, there are important declarations by figures like Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus – the current Director-General of the World Health Organization – about the importance of attendance and financing the anti-pandemic mechanism.
“Global supply chains have conventionally been focused on achieving financial efficiency above all else. The result ismessy and fragile global supply chain systems” (Worth 2021)
Much of the attention on international politics was framed around the idea of multinational companies as actors with strong economic-political weight. From 1970 to 2008, according to estimates by the World Economic Forum (2020), GVCs trade grew steadily. In these years, the outsourcing and offshoring tendencies – or the complete productive relocation – had been the main aspect of the global economy.
In the last few months, there have been several clear situations, for example, the number of waiting containers vessels due to a series of lockdowns or the mismatches in the provision of semiconductors that express strong impacts on the perspectives of production and consumption. Additionally, the search for transnational companies in robustness and geography brought their supply chains closer together.
In a world impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and the exacerbation of political, economic, and health tendencies, it is very improbable to manage as well as the non-existent political capital to build joint international policy frameworks, we can see how the multinational companies’ policies are oriented for locating their CGV’s from geographically close places, such as the Mexico-United States connection. In concrete terms, the economic impacts are clear; according to Bloomberg “there are 25,000,000 shipping containers at sea at any given time” at the same time that the cost of moving a container from China to the west coast of North America is estimated to have increased by 650 percent since before the pandemic”.
The race to the bottom – a capitalist symptom that constantly finds economic and productive solutions to improve the cost at any price – is contradictory to the efforts that the most important actors must do to reduce the climate risks. According to McKinsey Sustainability (2016) “The supply chain of a typical company is responsible for 80 per cent of its greenhouse emissions and more than 90 percent of its contribution to air pollution generated in the production and distribution of a consumer product.”
If we look at a large number of official documents and research from the academic community, such as the IPCC, World Bank, and BIs, we can see how the environmental situation is critical. Despite isolated efforts by, for example, Great Britain and France to rethink their energy structure towards cleaner forms, joint efforts to mitigate the impacts remain insignificant. The enormous distance between current policies and the objectives that the global community must achieve in the next few years is remarkably problematic.
That being said, at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), there are several problematic and discouraging components such as the absence of a country with doubled emission of CO2, the United States, China, and important Latin American countries (Brazil and Mexico), as well as the critical problems of US’s Congress to approve the substantial financial plan to create more sustainable energetic matrices. In fact, The United States, the second-largest emitter of CO2, currently has widely varying financial priorities between Pentagon expenditure and Climate funding.
Finally, the climate-economy dichotomy never exists, as they are two sides of the same coin. How can we explain the carbon dioxide footprints left by by-products that travel extreme distances – even unnecessarily many times? And how could we explain the political capital within the customs union to tax those industries and products that have high levels of pollution?
The political-economic elites must accelerate and take advantage of their large learning curves and incorporate more green technology, in addition to redefining their total national expenditures and defining green publishing policies. In addition, generating a significant reduction of climate risks will have positive externalities in economic returns and the rise in health and social welfare standards.
Responsibility must be assumed by political and economic elites to improve the tendencies of the international system. Nowadays, there are important political forces that make it difficult to agree on different policies such as the generalized process of trans-governmental construction anomie at the same time as a set of centrifugal forces, both domestic and systemic, that create even more complications to building certainty.  The disorder risks and uncertainty, as well as the series of potential disruptions, highlight the necessity to create holistic and pragmatic transnational policy frameworks and actions","April 09, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-the-entropy-and-multiplication-of-risks-the-last-period-of-globalization/,Joaquin Gomez Amato,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The Time for Consensus is Over: The Drums of War Are Rumbling in Argentina,"This article was intended to address the negotiation between different Argentinian leaders after the legislative election and the benefits it could have for the economy. However, just three days after the election, only 72 hours after President Fernandez addressed the opposition, the Peronist leader burnt his bridges with the radical right-wing, strongmen antagonists.
Thelegislative elections inArgentinaon November 14, 2021, were the final battle of the scenario discussed in thisarticle. The right-wing coalition Juntos won in 13 districts, but with a narrower difference in the Buenos Aires Province, a historic Peronist stronghold. With this result,Frente de Todos, the incumbent coalition, and Juntos got the same number of representatives in the deputies chamber.
These results gave the government the sense of a “tie”, especially due to the fact that Buenos Aires is often defined as the ‘mother of all battles’ when talking about Argentinian elections. Last Sunday,Alberto Fernández‘s administration was able to narrow the results of September’s defeat from 9% to 1.3% for the government’s candidate Victoria Tolosa Paz in the Peronist district.
The opposition leaders, Buenos Aires City GovernorHoracio Rodríguez Larretaand former PresidentMauricio Macri, were sober in their victory speeches since the difference was so narrow. However, the government didn't waste any time, and after the reading of the first results, President Fernández went on air with arecorded messageassuring the public that a new era was coming for the country, an era that would end the economic uncertainty that the Argentinians had suffered through. The message included a critical view of the past two years, acknowledged the difficulties caused by thepandemic, as well as acknowledged the impact of foreign debt in the Macri administration.
But the main dish of the president's speech was the need to agree to terms for negotiation with theIMF, including a spot for the opposition that won the election at the table. The presidentassuredthe public that
""If we want to solve the challenges we are heading, we need the big majorities to generate agreements. In this sense, as briefly as possible I’m going to meet the representatives of the popular will and listen to their views to agree on an agenda as broad as possible. A responsible opposition is a patriotic one, and this is what our people need.”.
In this line, the IMF pleaded for an agreement that includes“political support.”
One of the main antagonists of the Government is former President Mauricio Macri who, on the right-wing TV news channel ""La Nacion+"", criticized the call to dialogue as an ""opportunist action"" by the President. Other members of the former Macri administration, such as the President of the PRO Party (Macri's party) rejected the idea of consensus by affirming that she""did not hear any call for dialogue"".
The other rejection came from the ultra-conservative, alt-right leader and economist Javier Milei. The radical candidate was elected with 17% of the votes in Buenos Aires City, and when asked about the head of the executive he responded,“I do not have a dialogue with immoral people. We have a different approach, we think about the issues from a moral point of view. Our main problem is the collectivism that has so impoverished us.""
November 17 in Argentina is known as the “political activist day.” It commemorates the return of General Peron to the country after 18 years of exile caused by the military dictatorships and political proscription. The President chose this specific day to exhibit his political strength.
Worker unions and political activists of all the groups that integrate the Frente de Todos coalition were summoned to Mayo Square where the president was expecting them in a political rally. Alberto Fernandez was the main, and only, speaker. In his speech, he attacked the opposition, specifically Macri and Milei, and he affirmed that he was not going to have a dialogue if they didn't want to.
""That we can also build with those who don’t think like us. I listened to their responses. If Macri doesn’t want to talk, let him be alone with his friends doing business, no problem. If Milei doesn’t want to talk, let him stay locked up with those colleagues he has that deny diversity and deny state terrorism. We have nothing to talk about with them, let them stay there.""
However, theirs is also a battle behind the scenes, a staple in Argentine politics. As mentionedpreviously, president Fernandez needs to show strength inside his own party and with associates, specifically the Vice-President and former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez.  According to Minister Anibal, the head of state was bold in promoting his candidacy for reelection in 2023. Moreover, one of the Union's chiefs, Hector Daer, assured that""two years without a pandemic will give the president the possibility of being reelected"".
The real defiance to the inner members of the coalition was when Alberto Fernandez promised that in 2023, all embers of the coalition will compete in a primary to define the leadership, including the President himself.By opening this possibility, the war for the Presidency has not only started against the opposition but also inside the alliance that brought both Fernandez's to power in 2019.
The next two years, according to Hector Daer, will define the destiny of this South American nation until 2027. Not only will the combat be from the outside but it will be more hastened from the inside, thereby applying to both coalitions.
Whatever happens in 2023, November 17, 2021 showcases that the drums of war are rumbling.","January 06, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-time-for-consensus-is-over-the-drums-of-war-are-rumbling/,Tobias Belgrano,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Turkey’s Response to the Syrian Refugee Crisis,"The start of theSyrianCivil war on March 15, 2011, marked the start of the suffering for many families. These fights have recorded thousands of casualties. They have torn the nation and have also taken the nation back in its standards of living. It has also resulted in the mass movement of the Syrians to neighboring countries and regions within Syria itself.
“As to date, the Syrian refugee crisis remains the largest displacement crisis that has come about in our lifetime.”
Turkeyis a party to the Refugee Convention of 1951. However, it had geographical limitations that were prominent to people who became refugees because of events that had happened before January 1, 1951. This still did not limit Syrians from being able to seek refuge in Turkey.
The response by the Government of Turkey to the Syrian refugees was through the 2013 Law on Foreigners and International Protection. This law was the Temporary Protection (TP) regime for Syrian Refugees. The TP highlighted the rights and the responsibilities refugees had under their temporary protection; it also outlined the services that would be offered to those under protection. The organizations at the national, local, and international levels that were involved in the responses were also outlined. The TP did not have any limitations but rather included all Syrian refugees that were registered, as well as those who were not registered.
What started out as a small, is now a 10-year-long stretch since the first Syrians fled to Turkey to seek refuge. Turkey now hosts the largest refugee population in the world. Not only is it a place to seek refugee but is also home to many who found themselves homeless. Turkey made an effort to provide these people with social support; this includes camps to ensure shelter, as well as education, housing, and employment.
Of course, Turkey received assistance in trying to help the Syrian Refugees. TheWorld Bankand theEuropean Union(EU) assisted the Government of Turkey in their response to the refugee crisis. The main drive of this response to the crisis has been to improve the livelihoods of refugees. Not only should this response assist refugees but should also assist Turkish communities, both in rural areas and urban areas.
The continued support from the World Bank and EU is evident through their joined partnership to better help the living conditions for the refugees and Turkish citizens in Turkey. This project will help over 3 million Turkish citizens and refugees in 5 municipalities. It is a project that is headed by the Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP) and is aimed to improve sanitation, solid waste management, and water supply. This will be done through the construction of water treatment plants, transmission plants, wastewater treatment plants, and, lastly, sewage collection networks and landfills.
The estimated number of Syrians under Temporary Protection (SuTPs) by the Government of Turkey is 2 225 147. That is according to the new Policy Note that is prepared by the World Bank, Turkey’s Response to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the Road Ahead. This policy not only dives into the response Turkey had to the refugee crisis but also highlights the socioeconomic difficulties that are faced during these circumstances.
The response Turkey had to the crisis was more humanitarian-based. The support from Turkey was not only led by the government and official organizations but also by Turkish families and civil society organizations that made their own donations and other forms of assistance to the Syrian refugees. Many provinces in Turkey made personal financial contributions in support of the refugees.
One of the biggest problems that the Government of Turkey faces during hosting the refugees is mitigating the negative impacts that could potentially emerge from hosting the SuTPs while trying to bring out the positive contributions refugees can bring.
Educationis one of the areas that the Government of Turkey puts its focus on. There are three areas that Turkey took to ensure education. The first one is to integrate the children of Syria into the Turkish education system. The second one is to allow the community-based education programs to be run within the Syrian community. The reason behind this is that these programs have various curricula, and the Libyan curriculum and religious education are the most popular. The third area was the facilitation of the Syrian children to attend the SuTP-designed temporary education centers; these centers are managed by the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, they are administered by Turkish senior administrators, but the staff is Syrian teachers that use a modified version of the Syrian curriculum.
Housingandmunicipal mattersare areas of importance when it comes to the refuge of Syrian citizens. The plan onset the arrival of the Syrians was to host them in households, which were built on the existing social, cultural, and economic network in Turkey. However, over time this had to change. TheMigration Policy Centreshows that the new Syrian refugees had started finding their own accommodation as those who had lived with Turkish families had started to move out to find their own accommodation.
The Ministry of Health in Turkey showed that there were great efforts put into the effort to assist refugees that were in Turkey. Registered SuTPs were entitled to free healthcare from the Turkish facilities — this was upon their arrival. In communities, refugees were able to receive inpatient and primary healthcare services. Those who were not registered could access emergency care, and would later be required to register. Another effort that was put in place by the Government of Turkey was that it implemented campaigns in Arabic to spread knowledge on the prevention of diseases as well as the available healthcare services to them.
There is rising frustration during this time. This is both at local and provincial levels. In an effort to assist in these tensions, the SuTPs have access to social assistance and services made available by the government, municipalities, NGOs, and social solidarity foundations.

Milei: The Rise of the Populist Alt-right in Argentina,"On the closing night of Hugo Chavez Frías’s campaign, thousands of Venezuelans cheered around the box of the candidate who, in a few days, would be the next president ofVenezuela. The traditional parties of the Caribbean nation – Acción Democrática and COPEI – put aside their differences to prevent the charismatic leader from taking the Miraflores palace by storm. The plainsman from Barinas, astute in his oratory, described the alliance as “rotten domes” and hinted that if he lost the elections, it would be due to electoral fraud. Because the political leaders would never let him triumph, letting him triumph would mean the end of his privileges.
According to the famous political scientist Steven Levitsky, author of “How Democracies Die” there arethree fundamental characteristics of populism. One of them, used by Chavez, is brandishing an anti-establishment discourse and promising to wipe out the current political system. Second, populist leadership is usually made up of amateur candidates, as in the case ofTrump, whose first public position was that of President. The author’s final criterion is that leaders often refer to their supporters as the “people” and themselves as their representatives.
In recent years, Argentinian politics has witnessed the formation of two new government coalitions. The Frente de Todos y Juntos por el Cambio, which is made up of parties that are limited to the old Peronist-Radical antinomy. In their governments (so far) they have tended towards moderation due to the absence of legislative majorities and have alternated with each other for power, creating democratic continuity. The economistJavier Mileiis a character who seems to comply with two of Levitsky’s categories, which is reason enough to be alarmed according to the author. What is worrying is how he fuels the breakdown of the fragile political balance achieved. He encourages breaking this balance in the media, stating that the rift is really between the “real workers” and the “parasites of politics that impoverish us.”
This constant media presence and his proposals like “blowing up the Central Bank” have allowed him to amass a group of faithful followers who fill the auditoriums of his talks and social networks with a following of almost 65,000. His followers in Argentina, who clamor for the slogan “long live damn freedom” and nostalgically appeal to a glorious, liberal past, calling themselves “The Heirs of Alberdi.” Although the economist does not claim to represent the “people” he seems to be looking for his base of support in a middle class exhausted by economic pressure and instability. On the other hand, Milei’s amateurism in matters of state operation is clear, such as in his claims that the country’s fiscal deficit is caused by political spending, when almost all analysts agree that the bulk of national public spending is for the pension system.
In addition, his policy ideas usually include curious omissions, such as proposing that Argentina adopt an educational system of vouchers like the one applied in Chile. Lack of information in the educational sector and unequal conditions between private and public institutions in Chile resulted in subsidized schools for the rich and poor quality state schools for the poor. Chilean economists Cristian Aedo and Claudio Sapelli observed this phenomenon during the ’90s, indicating that Milei’s proposal to spend less would not actually change anything.
Thepandemicwill leave a “scorched land” in terms of the economy and the success of the reconstruction will depend on the degree of consensus reached by both Together for Change and the Front of All. Angry societies are impatient to seek political pacts, demand action, and seek culprits. Hopefully, the Argentinian political class will get the country out of the crisis through agreements. If not, there is a risk that society will embrace those who appeal to frustration as a campaign strategy for 2021. It was that social anger that led to characters like Chavez and Bolsonaro to gain power. Parties such as Justicialismo-Kirchnerismo and Radicalismo-PRO, are far from perfect, but they were fundamental pieces in the reconstruction of Argentina’s democracy in 1983. Making the reforms from within will be what heals the political system; if the symptoms are not attended to, in time the country will get sick.

Plundering in South Sudan: The Achilles’ heel of the world’s newest nation,"South Sudanhas entered the peace process and aims to bring stability back to the country and its people. Although the civil war has passed and steps to move forward have been made, the country still struggles with the threats of corruption and the effects thereof. This significantly affects efforts to provide humanitarian aid to civilians who have not only suffered the horrific consequences of civil war, but also extreme flooding, continued displacement, malnutrition, famine, and low standard of living. A recentUN reporton the plundering of public resources by government officials indeed indicates that this phenomenon continues to hamper recovery, reconciliation, and political stability in South Sudan.
On September 23, 2021, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CoHRSS) presented areportfrom the Conference Room Paper to the Human Rights Council which found that South Sudanese political elites divertedUS$73 millionfrom public coffers over a period of two years. The diverted US$73 million included transactions worth an astonishing US$39 million, which were made in less than eight weeks. In fact, this noteworthy amount is merely a fraction of the estimated total of US$4 billion, which“President Salva Kiir himself admitted as far back as 2012.”
The report found that the recent plundering is“merely the tip of the iceberg”and that there are indeed patterns and trends that involve government officials, politicians, military personnel, and various multinational banks. However, the participation of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, the National Revenue Authority, and external actors has not been excluded.
Dr. Martin Elia Lomuro, the South Sudanese Minister of Cabinet Affairs, dismissed the UN’s report and stated that it was in fact part of “an international campaign against thegovernment”and that there are“organizations that are sponsored not to see political stability in South Sudan.”Lomuro strongly believes that this is the cause of interference by external actors, and only the people of South Sudan can hold the government accountable. However, Lomuro made no further comment in support of his accusations, nor did he name the accused.
Corruption, plundering, and war are continuously connected toSouth Sudan’s resource curse – i.e., its abundance of oil reserves. The government’s“highly informal system of oil revenue collection”lacks supervision and transparency, thus making way for the misappropriation of revenues deriving from oil trades. The abundance of oil reserves has attracted foreign interests, which puts the South Sudanese government under pressure and has, in turn, created a “global web of corruption,”Foreign Policyreporter Robbie Gramerwrotein 2019.
Gramer’s report suggests that the main actors in this global network of corruption include“American arms dealers, British business tycoons, and Chinese oil giants.”This indeed reflects that corruption in South Sudan is rife, both transnationally and locally, proving the country’s public coffers to be increasingly vulnerable to plundering or the diversion of funds.
TheRepublic of South Sudanhas recently come out of a devastatingcivil warthat began in 2013, shortly after gaining independence in 2011. The last ceasefire was signed in 2018 after“nearly 400 000 were killed”during the civil war.President Salva Kiir has since pledged that he will not return to civil war.However, the recent human rights violations and military actions put the efforts to maintain peace at risk. The civil war has left70% of the country’s population in need of humanitarian aidto counteract famine and malnutrition, as well as the urgent need for drinking water, sanitation, housing, and healthcare.
There are8.4 millionpeople in need of humanitarian assistance,5.5 millionof which are in need of food assistance. In September 2021,US$4.39 millionin cash-based transfers for food assistance were made. This amount successfully reached 83.5% of the targeted3.64 millionpeople by the World Food Project (WFP). Thus, 16.5% of the targeted population remained undernourished.
Considering that US$4.39 million in cash-based transfers for food assistance were made in September 2021, the plundered US$70 million could pay for US$4.39 million in cash-based transfers for just short of 17 months. Alternatively, it could be deducted from theUS$456 millionrequired for the WFP’s 6-month net funding requirements, reducing the total 6-month net funding requirements to US$383 million.
The food crisis has been exacerbated by the recent floods, which have been the worst in“nearly 60 years”affecting more than 700,000 people, with this number continuing to grow. The effects of heavy rains and flash floods have left people homeless, including people in refugee camps and recently reintegrated displaced persons. The recent humanitarian efforts to return displaced persons back to their homelands and deliver food to those in need have been tremendously set back in both time and funding.
Many organizations, governments, and commissions have made donations and funded humanitarian efforts. Among others, the European Commission has donated$2.3 millionin humanitarian aid to South Sudan to assist those affected by the recent flooding. However, there has also been a decrease in donations and funding. This was the case of theUnited Kingdom, whichcut its aid to South Sudan by 59%. Christian Aid, one of South Sudan’s most committed donors, has called for the 59% cut to be reversed as the cut has resulted in the termination of Christian Aid’s work in South Sudan. Christian Aid has spent£800,000per year in assistance, amounting to a total of £2,4 million ($3.2 million USD) over the past three years in its efforts to assist South Sudan.
Both the $2.3 million donated by the European Commission (EC) and the $3.2 million spent by Christian Aid could have been covered by the diverted $73 million if not used for the food program. This would leave an excess of $67.5 to add to funds that are allocated for humanitarian projects to reach those who are in desperate need. Nevertheless, the recent plundering of public finances in South Sudan poses a huge threat to humanitarian assistance, the peace process, and political stability. Corruption in South Sudan, whether it has a direct or indirect impact on the state of the country, might be the Achilles’ heel of the world’s newest nation.

Constitutional Review in Botswana: The Nexus between Cultural-Liberal Values and its Implications for Foreign Policy,"The constitution ofBotswanahas been a bone of contention for several reasons, including its exclusion of somehuman rightssuch as the right to education and its non-recognition of some societal groups – people living with disabilities and religious groups, amongst others. Also, absent from the constitution is the recognition of Batswana ethnic cultures even though they influence socio-political interactions, and to a certain extent, the country’s diplomacy.
The recent incidents of women being turned away fromKgotlain some villages across the country, for wearing pants instead of dressing ‘womanly’ to getCOVID-19vaccinations, as an example of how culture is embedded in societal interactions, make it imperative to highlight cultural norms and values in the envisaged new constitution. They clearly have a bearing on government institutions’ priorities and implementation of policies. The cultural values and norms also shape the state’s behavior internationally. As such, constitutional recognition will not only preserve them but will also institutionalize a co-existence with democratic liberal norms.
In his 2019 election campaign manifesto, Mokgweetsi Masisi, the current president of Botswana, declared a need for constitutional review. He then solidified his commitment to the process byappointing a Constitutional Review Commissionon 17 December 2021. This progress was especially welcomed by Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) who had already begun community dialogues regarding the exercise.
Chief among the emerging issues in these meetings was the emphasis on an inclusive consultative process, which was indicative of Batswana’s desire to have all existing cultural identities, values, and norms reflected in the constitution, as well as the voices of all societal groups to be heard.
While in its current state the constitution upholds the protection of fundamentalhuman rightsand individual freedoms, it excludes the protection of collective values and norms that have been a part of Botswana societies since time immemorial. When these values have been expressed, they have been a source of contention.
As Botswana’s first president, Sir Seretse Khama, once said,
‘…a nation without a past is a lost nation, and a people without a past is a people without a soul.’
This warning is more relevant today than when it was first issued, as the fundamental values of Batswana have progressively been overshadowed by liberal norms espoused in the constitution.
Attempts, although failed, to drive Basarwa – a minority ethnic group in Botswana – from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in the premise of development highlight the need to clearly stipulate the rights to participate in and maintain cultural values and practices in the constitution, in order to avoid confusion and marginalization.
It is worth noting that both cultural and liberal norms have a place in a modern constitutional order like Botswana’s. It is thus imperative for the country’s constitution to be drafted in such a way that these values and norms are reconciled in the interest of social cohesion.
Democracyis an intrinsic part of the Botswana culture and there is no reason why the traditional cultural values of the Batswana people should not be clearly reflected in the constitution. Besides, recognizing the existing cultural diversity and including cultural norms will make the constitution and the country even more democratic. Chapter one and two of the South African constitution have successfully encapsulated these and can be used for benchmarking. The table below shows how Botswana’s cultural values and liberal ethos converge or diverge.
Table 1: Divergence and Convergence of  Liberal Democratic Ethos and Botswana Cultural values
There is near consensus in international relations scholarship thatforeign policyis largely informed by leaders’ personalities and idiosyncrasies. Cultural socialization, therefore, shapes these personalities and consequently the foreign policy decisions they make. Recognizing these cultural factors in the constitution is imperative as their manifestations have been apparent in Botswana’s foreign policy decisions over the years.
In alignment with the nation’s cultural values of collectiveness, the founding president of the country, Sir Seretse Khama, embraced multilateralism. In a September1969 speech, he recognized theUnited Nation’s role in advancing national interests through development cooperation and as a forum for international dialogue. Ian Khama, the former president of Botswana (from April 2008 to April 2018) and son of Seretse Khama, however, held the other end of the stick. His foreign policy was characterized by heavy criticism of his African counterparts based on what he perceived as a lack of commitment to upholding democratic principles. As such, he generally abstained from regional and sub-regional meetings such as those of theAfrican Union(AU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
While his behavior was undiplomatic, particularly because Botswana is a member state of these institutions, Ian Khama’s chieftaincy background had a lot to do with it. Traditionally, as a chief ‘mafoko a Kgosi a agelwa mosako’ or ‘mafoko a Kgosi a mantle otlhe’ (lit.words at the communal meeting place are all beautiful), in this context is often interpreted as the notion that the chief’s word and decisions are final and suggests that he is a ‘law unto himself.’ When this is translated into his foreign policy stance, it means he is not bound by international norms but could make proclamations based on his moral standing.
That notwithstanding, other presidents after Sir Seretse Khama toed the line with his founding principles and in alignment with cultural values. The deep cultural embeddedness of the saying ‘ntwa kgolo ke ya molomo or we jaw jaw not war war’ – loosely translated that the highest form of war is dialogue – has been the bedrock of Botswana’s peaceful democracy and has given credibility to its mediation efforts across the African continent. As such, former presidents Sir Ketumile Masire and Festus Mogae, both facilitated peace processes in theDemocratic Republic of the CongoandSouth Sudan, respectively. Masire also served asChairmanof the International Panel of Eminent Personalities investigating the circumstances surrounding the 1994RwandaGenocide from 1998 to 2000, while Mogae went on to be anawardeeof the Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership.
A constitution is a fundamental tool upon which a country’s rule of law is derived. If it is found to be inconclusive as is the case with the Botswana constitution, it is a potential source of instability especially when founding principles that promote cohesiveness are excluded from it. As such, it is imperative that the mooted constitutional review process recognizes and affirms the cultural values and practices of Batswana.

Gender Pay Gap: How the Covid-19 Pandemic Set Gender Parity Back a Generation,"Once a year, The World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes areporton the current state of gender parity. The 2021 publication revealed that we are still257.2 years away from closing the gender gap in “economic participation” and “opportunity”.
Sincegender inequalityis an ongoing issue at a global level, it is usually tracked in four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment. The WEF findings show thatPolitical Empowermentremains the largest of the four gaps tracked. Across the 156 countries covered by the index, women represent only 26.1% of 35,500 parliament seats and just 22.6% of over 3,400 ministers.
On a positive note, the gaps inEducational AttainmentandHealth and Survivalare nearly closed. The latter has been reduced by 96%, yet the time for it to reach 100% remains undefined. In Educational Attainment, “95% has been closed globally, with 37 countries already at parity”. The index estimates that, on its current trajectory, it will take another 14.2 years to completely settle this breach. TheEconomic Participation and Opportunitygap remains the second-largest of the four. According to the report, 58% have been closed so far, andit is the dimension with the lowest progress out of the four. This scenario can be explained by two opposing trends:
Sincethe outbreak of the pandemic, gender gaps in labor force participation have increased. The pandemic thus set progress back by a generation,increasing the time needed to achieve overall parity between the genders from 99.5 years to 135.6 years.
Covid-19had an undeniable effect on the global economy. Whilst the global pandemic showcased and aggravated disparity between genders, nevertheless, the structural inequality was standing strong before the virus struck. Job losses hit women disproportionately hard.
According toOxfam, women ─overrepresented in low-paid, precarious sectors like retail, tourism, and food services─ lost more than 64 million jobs last year, a 5% total loss, compared to a 3.9% loss for men.By the end of 2021, men’s jobs are forecasted to have recovered, but there will still be 13 million fewer women employed. LinkedIn data further shows a marked decline of women’s hiring into leadership roles, creating a reversal of 1 to 2 years of progress across multiple industries. In addition, the pandemic cost women $800 billion in loss of income worldwide. As a consequence, globally, 47 million women are expected to fall into extreme poverty, living on less than $1.90 a day.
Moving forward after the pandemic, economic recovery must be thought of in terms of equality. In fact, recovery could serve as an opportunity to rethink equal insertion inside the work environment, as well as outside.One step forward is to tackle the “care crisis”.Women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of daily unpaid care work ─housework, childcare, and caring for sick relatives─ a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year (see alsoFeminist Economics: A Deeper Look into Gender and Economics). As an example, on average across the globe, women spend 4 hours and 22 minutes per day in unpaid labor, compared to 2 hours and 15 minutes for men. Covid-19 has widened this gap even further. Women are now spending 15 hours more in unpaid labor each week than men.
Family-support policies are crucial to even this bias in “care work”. For instance, in developed and emerging economies, women who have a spouse are less likely to be employed in a paid job or be actively looking for one. This can often arise from the economic stability of a partner’s income that can reinforce the “male breadwinner” archetype in some relationships. Furthermore, in many cases, women’s economic freedom remains vital to get out of abusive relationships and domestic violence.Another issue is the gap in senior-level positions. Very few women are CEOs of the world’s largest corporations. As of theAugust 2020 Fortune Global List, only 13 women (2.6%) were CEOs of Fortune Global 500 companies ─ and all of them were white. Implementing quotas to increase women in corporate boards can be a useful tool to ensure steps for a more equal representation.
Equality does not operate in isolation.Striving to end the gender gap is not only a matter of social justice but of economic advancement as well. Diversity has long since been proven to foster innovation, and innovation is the central point around which our economy currently moves. Pushing an inclusive narrative forward can ensure a more stable context, not only for women but for the whole workforce.

[ANALYSIS] A Multi-Peripheral Middle Power: Strategizing Canada’s Next Security & Defence Policy,"After the September 20th election, Canadians voted for Parliament to remain unchanged—electing a liberal minority government withJustin Trudeauas Prime Minister. Despite the election being heavily impacted by domestic politics, the run-up to election day was racked by foreign policy blunders. Although the political party leaders ofCanadadiscussed the failed withdrawal ofAfghanistan, the two Michaels, and declining Sino-Canadian relations, no major party put forward a national defense and security strategy.
In a transitioning period of foreign relations, the international rules-based order—a system that Canada helped create and sustain—is being tested and rearranged to reflect the growing shifts in power politics, strategic competition, and coalition building. Best captured byChina’s ever-growing presence in the Indo-Pacific and struggle for Taiwan; theUSandGreat BritainunderminingFrance’s, a fellow NATO ally, submarine deal with Australia to establish anAnglospheresecurity pact known as AUKUS; and Russia’s re-assertive behavior and militaristic stance towards Ukraine and Eastern Europe, it is time for Canada and its government todevelop a national defense and security strategy that can protect, advance and attain its national interests. Canada’sonly national strategy,Securing an Open Society: Canada’s National Security Policy, from 2004 can no longer be relied upon as an established and tested framework for security and defense planning in lieu of the current geopolitical environment.
As the second installment of athree-part analysis on Canadian foreign policy, this article pushes the boundaries of contemporary Canadian foreign policy thinking to demonstrate the need for a new national strategy. It will also bring forward updated aspects of middle power-hood that cancontribute to pragmatic and rational planning for how Canada can protect, advance,and attain its national interests in areas of security and defense.
To develop a new national defense and security strategy, Canadian governmental and departmental planning analysts, officers and leaders need torevise their concept of what Canada is and is not within a regional and global context of a multipolar rules-based order.The first area that needs updating is Canada’s status as a middle power.
As we understand them today, middle powers were created in the aftermath of World War II and against the backdrop of the Cold War’s bipolarity. Since the early 1970’s academic scholars and professional policy experts—ranging fromCarsten Holbraad, Robert Cox,Andrew Cooper, andRoland Paris—have arrived at aconsensus that there are specific traits that a middle power needs to exhibit.These middle power traits vary, but they tend to follow the same line of theoretical thinking detailing the need for a middle power to have‘middle-range’ geographical, positional, and behavioral attributes and capabilities.
With these central elements of middle power characteristics being universally agreed upon and frequently recycled in scholarship and strategic analysis, middle power concepts have welcomed numerous and varying state actors into the middle-tier of power classification. For instance, countries likeCanada, Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealandare commonly identified as middle powers. More recently, however, countries like Russia, Brazil, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia have also been identified as such.
If Canada believes that its national security and defense interests are still best advanced and attained as a middle power,it needs to be steadfast in exhibiting middle power characteristics.With the geopolitical environment becoming more competitive and, at times, confrontational,Canada needs to update its middle power traits to become a more prominent actor with legitimate stacks in arapidly shifting multipolar rules-based order.
To accomplish such a feat, Canada should reinforce its ‘middle-range’ positional traits—medial geopolitical positioning, economic standards, and diplomatic proficiency—to sway away from the traditionalone material measurementof middle power-hood. By incorporating its conventional military power and global diplomatic footprint, Canada can better showcase its ‘middle-range’ position to great and small powers.
Second, Canada must exhibit atrait of being content with its geopolitical and hierarchical ranking in the rules-based order.Despite having a limited ability to project hard power or high capacities for political, economic, and diplomatic pressures,middle powers best serve their national interests when they occupy their rank as contentedly as possible.Such a trait will accreditCanada withbeing a benign powerin the geopolitical order’s construct and hierarchy.
This normative belief will project Canada as arepresentative power that aims to maintain the order’s integrity and prosperityas it provides a “common advantage” for all members in advancing their national interests. Overall, this trait will showcase any assertiveness and prudent strategic orientation from Canada as a reaction to maintaining and advancinga fixed and legitimate structure of power parity.
Thirdly,Canada needs to employ a foreign policy that builds upon the normative essence ofliberal-realismthat manifests stewardship over a hierarchical order, thereby legitimizing and bridging the system’s governance to top-tier and lower-tier powers. By establishing stewardship elements in its national strategy,Canada can affix theirhistorical tendencieswith the new realities of multipolarity, power politics, and strategic competition.
Lastly, Canada needs to manifest its middle power status witha distinguished geographical trait that harnesses its resources and capabilitiesto better posture and engage among neighboring state actors and extra-regional powers, therebyrooting its strategic orientation to multiple geopolitical zones.
Although these characteristics may be challenging to update in a national defense and security strategy, Canada can swiftly adapt them when interposing itself as amulti-peripheral middle power with regional prominence in three geopolitical flanks—namely the Arctic, transatlantic, and transpacific regions.
Canada’s attitude towards its northern region is best captured through its most recent self-proclaimed national identity as an Arctic state. Released in 2000, theNorthern Dimension of Foreign Policy, completed the shift of Canada’s foreign policy strategy that linked and enhanced its national security and defenseto human security, along with the establishment of a circumpolar region as a legitimate extension of the rules-based order.
Canada also used the Arctic as avital geopolitical instrumentto extend and advance its national interests and values onto regional institutions and diplomatic infrastructure that led to the creation of the Arctic Council. Canada also was influential in developing its Arctic interests by sending a delegation to theUNCLOS III discussionsin the early 1980s thatresulted in the treaty to include a‘Canadian Clause.’Article 234, as it is known, included support for Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, a vital waterway that acts as a shipping route for commercial vessels to transport public goods from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.
As a geopolitical flank of Canadian national security and defense in recent years, the Arctic has undergone a strategic paradigm shift. Under the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, from 2006 to 2015, the governmental strategy was directed to emphasize greater state-centric policies over territorial sovereignty and concerns from a larger Russian military footprint in the region. By contrast, the current Liberal government of Justin Trudeau has taken a community-based perspective, assuming that its interests over Arctic security and defenseare better served fromdomestic-oriented policiesthat promote and protect Indigenous communities and the environment.
However, as power politics and multipolarity become more pronounced in international relations, Canada needs toupdate its Arctic strategy to anticipate and prepare for likely and future conventional, unconventional and grey-zone threats.Moreover, as the damages from climate change continue, the Arctic will become a geopolitical landscape of opportunity with the discovery of new natural resources, resulting in new avenues for strategic competition. Lastly, the Arctic will undoubtedly become a geopolitical zone thatwill test a rules-based structure asstate and non-state actors seek to ignore and projecttheir power over crucial institutional and territorial jurisdictions.
For these reasons, Canada must become a prominent Arctic power by using its middle power credentials thatintegrate its ‘middle-range’ capabilities with liberal-realist principles to enhance its sovereignty and military deterrence through a stewardship attitude to seize the Arctic’s potential on Canadian national security and defense.
Canada has identified itself as a transatlantic power for much of its existence, reflecting its foundingculture and traditional immigration patternsarriving from Europe, its involvement in both transatlantic theatres of World War I and II, and the transatlantic region’s central importance to Canadianforeign policy belief, alongside continentalism and multilateralism, in the postwar period. With its strong transatlantic linkages, strategic orientation, and grouping with the triumphant West, Canada was successful in becoming a distinguished member of NATO—where today it has a leading role in Eastern Europe with Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP)—and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the predecessor to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
Despite the rise of China and the economic importance of the Indo-Pacific region,Canada must maintain a strong, secure, and anchored transatlantic strategy.Although it is easy to take for granted the security and defense certainties of Canada’s eastern flank, the rumblings brought on by Russia’srenewed assertion of military behaviorto Eastern Europe, the decline of European liberal democracies, thefragility of North Africa and the Middle Eastto terrorist organizations and mass migration, along with China’s ever-growing desire to widen itsmonetary footprint in Europe, highlight the reasons for whyCanada cannot completely shift its strategic orientation towards new and more ‘attractive’ geopolitical zones.
Canada should reinforce its strategic posture and traditional linkages to the transatlantic region to advance Canada’s reputation and status as a reliable and prominent middle power.Maneuvering a fortified transatlantic strategy will also reassure Canada’s European partners and NATO allies that it is independent of US foreign policy planning,a long-associated problemof Canadian foreign policy. What is more,a fortified strategy would see Canada entrench deeper military interoperability and strategic cohesion with its NATO alliesto regional challenges and threats from existing disputes,showcasing its middle power prevalence and stake in upholding established rules-based organizations and conventions.
With China finalizing its great power rise globally and, more importantly, regionally, the Indo-Pacific has become the geopolitical periphery for economic, security, and defense strategies. Moreover, with the region becoming the economic engine of the emerging multipolar order,the Indo-Pacific will undoubtedly influence how Canada identifies its future national interests.
Despite Canadian engagement with the region being largely absent in current foreign policy initiatives, best showcased withCanada being a no-showat the signing of the CPTPP,Canada has historic regional engagements that prove the region’s potential in shaping and extending Canada’s diplomatic, economic and military geopolitical footprint.
Under the pressure ofUS President Joe Biden, thetense diplomatic relationshipwith China and other liberal-democratic allies and partners developing a regional strategy, Canada is crafting an Indo-Pacific strategy. However, to hammer a strategy that underscores clear and distinct security and defence interests,Canada’s Indo-Pacific strategy needs to independently frame its national interests from engagement strategies that accentuategreat power and strategic competitionwith China that aim to balance and hedge its hegemonic motivations.
Although long-standing partners and allies, like the US, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, may rebuke such a strategy from Canada,the lack of interest shown by these allies for greater Canadian strategic involvement in the QUAD, AUKUS, and other regional organizations showcase their attitude to accompany and promote Canadian security and defense interests in their regional strategies.Thus, for Canada to fully embrace its multi-peripheral middle power status, its Indo-Pacific strategy needs to incorporate three areas of engagement.
The first area should focus on buildingCanada’smiddle power relationshipwith other regional middle powers in the Indo-Pacific—Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia being prime actors to pursue.Greater middle power strategic interaction will enforce Canada’s middle power fixation, thereby curbing the attraction to join regional security pacts that aim to restrain China through military blocs and initiatives directly. This area will also highlightCanada’s determination to bring forward alternatives for small, minor, and middle powers that rely on China for economic stability but do not support its aggressive and, at times, belligerent behaviorto regional security and defenseissues and disputes.
The second area should build off Canada’s middle power cooperation withinitiatives that bolster the rules-based order’s institutional and normative structures to advance and leverage Canadian security and defense interests with fellow regional middle powers.However, to attract and maintain diversification in its Indo-Pacific strategy, Canada must avoid upholdingunambiguous democratic values and human rightsprinciples as vital grounds for cooperation—concepts that are not traditionally and contemporarily held as vital foreign policy initiatives for Indo-Pacific middle powers.
Instead, Canada should focus on rules-based principles that have imperative consequences for the region’s middle powers to flourish and survive.Thus, Canada is encouraged to develop and enforce itsdiplomatic and naval capabilities to ensure that the Indo-Pacific’ssea lanes of communication (SLOCs),freedom of navigation, and theuniversal adherenceto the rule of law is reinforcedamong growing power politics, Sino-US great power competition and extra-regional engagement from European actors.
Lastly,Canada needs to reinterpret its strategic posture to China when it unilaterally and illicitly punishes Canada for upholding the principles of a rules-based order and standing alongside partners and allies on legitimate defence and security grounds.Maintaining the Four Cs—coexist, compete, cooperate and challenge—in its posture to China can be beneficial inprojecting a niche avenue for Sino-Canadian relations.Nevertheless,Canada needs to incorporate the Four Cs with more of its hard power capabilities to deterChina from undertaking belligerent behavior, like the arbitrary arrest of the two Michaels, in the future.
For Canada to attain, advance, and promote its middle power status in a shifting global order, Canadian political, military, and diplomatic leaders need to understand its future in the Arctic, transatlantic and transpacific regions. By incorporating thesethree geopolitical zones with an updated middle power status into a new national defense and security strategy,Canada can better evaluate how to attain its national interests while identifying the strategic avenues it can absorb to become a prominent power in resolving international and regional issues, disputes and conflicts.
In the post-Cold War period, Canada was an influential and impactful actor. Instead of lingering on its past roles and achievements, Canada needs to create a new strategic outlook that will bridge its historical tendencies with the new realities of the multipolar order.The world needs more of Canada, but it needs a Canada that is ready to contend with the problems and challenges of the present and future.Developing a new national security and defense strategy is the first step, and it will signal to the rest of the world that Canada is a capable and reliable power.

Will 2022 Bring “Ordem e Progresso” to Brazil?,"The ultra-conservative government ofJair Bolsonarois experiencing its hardest challenge. The president’s approval rating fell to its lowest since 2019 at only 19%. Due to his mismanagement duringthe pandemic, lack of economic achievements, and growing national inflation, Bolsonaro’s flagship has sunk to its deepest point.
On the other side of the sea,former President Luis Inacio “Lula” Da Silvaleads the race for the 2022 election, almost doubling the vote intention of the government. With 55% for Lula against 32% for the ruling coalition, the numbers of a ballotage scenario are bitter for the Brazilian alt-right. The former steel-worker union leader has also struck Bolsonaro by forming an alliance with ex-presidents, likeFernando Henrique Cardoso, with the objective of constructing a joint force against the sitting president.
During Lula’s rule in 2010, Brazil became the 8th largest economy in the world. However, his return doesn’t necessarily mean that Brazil will return to the international podium. The reasons for the political instability in Brazil started long before Bolsonaro came to power. Such misgivings can be traced back to 2016 when Dilma Rousseff was impeached in a controversial process where  Bolsonarodedicated his vote to the memory of Dilma’s torturer.
Beyond the political show of 2016, during the PT’s (Partido dos Trabalhadores) period in government, an exceptional economic growth occurred due to the high prices of raw materials such as soybean and oil (Brazil is rich in both resources). With this unexpected income, and a solid economic situation after the emerging country’s debt crises in the late ’90s, Brazil skyrocketed in the early 2000s and Lula was able to use this income to build and, more importantly, in Machiavelli’s terms, sustain a coalition of power in 2002 included 13 parties. However, the crucial member of the alliance joined in 2005 when the right-wing party, the PMDB, joined Lula’s coalition. The alliance included the incorporation of ex-President Michel Temer, known onTwitteras the “Brazilian Underwood”.
Lula used the economic resources to build and sustain a big and heterogeneous coalition using excessive incomes from resources like oil. These resources were transferred through state-owned companies likePetrobras.Without the boom in commodities, will it be possible for Lula to build stability? What are the causes that affect the political stability in the country?
In “How is Brazil Ruled?” Argentinian author Vicente Palermo gives some clues about the complexities in the Brazilian political system, arguing that it is structurally prone to instability because of the federal system of government, a fragmented political party system, and a president with concentrated attributions in the executive branch that clash with a highly volatile and fragmented congress.
The Federative Republic of Brazil has a strong tradition of local elites that concentrate the economic and political power of the regions that form the country. This heritage goes back to the Brazilian Empire and the First Republic where local elites controlled the production of prominent resources and controlled the political scenario rotating in their control of the presidency.
Brazil’s federal institutions are considered much stronger than their Argentinian, Mexican, or Venezuelan neighbors. The strength of the federal system re-enforces the distribution of power in the territory with strong governors in every state. This fact combined with a fragmented party system makes for a fatal combination.
The solidity of federal institutions could be observed when President Bolsonaro intended to boycott the lockdown in São Paulo against the will of the governor. This crisis led the rest of the governors to apply their own sanitary measures against the president’s will.
Fragmented Party System
A federal organization combined with a proportional electoral system that chooses deputies via open seats is the breeding ground for a chaotic party system, especially where the electorates do not fully understand the party loyalties of their candidates and where party discipline is hard to achieve. The result has been the highest number of parties in the world, having the number of relevant parties reaching almost ten.
The impact on the composition of legislative chambers includes a diverse and hyper-heterogeneous Congress, where deputies change parties almost monthly due to the priority of local interests over national issues. Such an occurrence makes it less likely to follow both the line of national leadership and whomever operates in parties that try to persuade different social classes and political ideologies at a regional level (“catch-all” parties).
Another consequence of this volatility is the lack of a national agenda in legislation that forces the executive branch to intervene using provisional decrees,Medidas Provisória, to get some level of legislative initiative. However, this tool in the hands of the executive generates confrontation with congress due to its total exclusion in the production of legislation.
As previously mentioned, the centralization of the legislative agenda in the hands of the president causes frictions with Congress. Palermo describes the system as a presidency vested with strong proactive powers and very strong institutional constraints. If coalitions are held with the intention of possibly governing, the distribution of ministries should be even, particularly when talking about big, complex alliances. The negotiations and conformation of presidential staff tend to be chaotic due to the changing dynamics of the regional interests and the volatility of the political actors, thereby bringing the instability of Congress to the president’s office.
Due to the political reality of the Brazilian institutions, and the present stability of commodity prices, the elected government in 2022 will lack the economic resources to build and sustain political coalitions and give governance to the South American Nation. If Lula is to be elected, the tools used in the past to build stability won’t be applicable this time. In the context of a polarized election, the PT leader might need to build a brand-new political agenda with a complex Congress.
If Lula is to rule without a legislative majority, he might be tempted to get the initiative through executive decrees. This would be risky due to the possible opposition of Congress in feeling isolated in a fragmented context. No matter who gets elected, the future of Brazil is filled with challenges to its political stability.

Could Inflation Prove More Damaging than Parties to Boris Johnson’s Leadership?,"Despite Prime MinisterBoris Johnson‘s pre-pandemic popularity which won him a strong majority in the 2019 UK general election, his post-pandemic approval ratings suggest thatalmost two-thirds of adults now disapprove of his political performance. The most recent ‘party-gate’ scandalhas been circulating throughout British media, but a potentially unpopular crisis is fast approaching the prime minister:inflation.
The UK’s rate of inflation rose to 5.4% in December, its highest rate in almost 30 years. Inflation is a measure of the increase in the cost of goods and services over time. Inflation rates are measured by comparing the cost of goods and services to their average cost a year ago. With the rate of inflation rising to 5.4%, a £5.10-pint last year would now cost £5.38. While this may seem a small price to pay, increases in costs across the board drastically affect household expenditure. In the UK, this has also coupled with dramatic increases inenergycosts, with the UK’s energy regulator Ofgem announcing a rise of as much as £500 above the annual energy price cap on energy bills from April. This cost of living crisis is occurring in the midst of a cabinet crisis, with Johnson facing serious leadership doubts over allegations of attending and hosting parties on Downing Street at the height of theCovid-19 pandemicand the UK lockdown in Spring/Summer 2020.
Why is Inflation Rising so Much?
The biggest increases between November and December 2021 were in food and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as in restaurants, hotels, furniture, household goods, clothing, and footwear according to the ONS. However, a significant proportion of the rising cost of living is due to the energy crisis with a “rise of over 50% in energy costs over the last six months with gas prices hitting a record high as the world emerges from lockdown”.
The latest rises are an 18.8% increase in the cost of electricity and a shocking 28.1% increase in the cost of gas over the last 12 months. Without tackling the energy crisis, it seems the rising cost of gas and electricity will continue to drive up the inflation rate and household costs. Following calls for “helicopter money”, or emergency cash payments, to households struggling with the rising cost of living,the Guardiancreated a graph of possible government responses:
The cheapest option for the government would be cash bonuses to the households that will face the most financial struggle with rising costs in energy and living; either a one-off £300 or £500 payment to households on universal credit, or to households earning less than £50k a year. The most expensive option would be limiting the increase in the energy price cap, which is what Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is considering. The positive impact of this choice would be preventing the inflation rate from escalating further in April, when it is predicted to reach 6%, by stopping bills from increasing.
However, concerns are already being raised by the third sector, such as by the anti-poverty charity Joseph Rowntree Foundation, for immediate cash payments to those already severely struggling. Age UK is also warning that the elderly and pensioners are already having to turn off their heating because these groups are more likely to live in “fuel poverty”, a term used to describe a household whose members cannot afford to keep their space adequately warm at a reasonable cost due to their income.
If the energy price cap were to rise in April, taxes and National Insurance will rise as well. The Resolution Foundation is predicting an extra £1,200 annual increase in costs to the average household, beyond the capacity of many across the UK. What is the solution?
The Labour Party has pledged to immediately eliminate the VAT on energy bills, costing £2.5 billion overall and cutting the cost of bills by £90. This will be paid for by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, which they claim are facing record profits because of the increased cost of energy. Of the top ‘Big Six’ British energy suppliers, these are their profits overall in 2020 and 2021:
According to the figure, the Big Six are making profits during this time of high energy prices, and a windfall tax to cover the £2.5 billion needed to eliminate VAT is not improbable. These profits also make the plan to give energy companies £20 billion to cover their increased costs during the crisis seem more like giving money away to companies that could cover the costs themselves, especially in comparison to struggling households.
As Labour is not in government, it will be up to Sunak to decide how to solve the crisis. It is not an easy decision, and the cost of living is not likely to lower any time soon without drastic action. Following the ‘bring your own booze’ work events and parties in No. 10 Downing Street gardens, as well as accusations of blackmail and bullying, Sunak is one of the favored contenders for Conservative leadership if Johnson were to resign, or were removed. Currently, around 35 letters of no confidence are believed to have been sent to the 1922 committee, and once 54 letters have been sent, a vote of no confidence will be triggered and there will be a re-election for the leader of the Conservative party, deciding the next Prime Minister. If this event were to be triggered, Sunak’s handling of the energy and inflation crisis will be highly influential in his bid for leadership.

Fernet with Vodka,"The Argentinians adopted, due to the Italian immigration of the early XX century, a sour herbal wine called “Fernet Branca” – usually mixed with the popular drink “Coca Cola.” The country consumes more than 75% of all Fernet Branca produced globally.
This appropriation speaks about how the South American nation’s personality, the love for foreign Italian tradition, mixed with the popular taste of Coca Cola has become as national as a strong and dry vodka for the Russians. The sour taste of Fernet makes it tough to combine it with vodka. However, in harsh times, beggars cannot be choosers.
Much has been said about the geopolitical situation inRussiaduring the last few days, but what’s the political luggage thatAlberto Fernandezis dragging from Buenos Aires to Moscow? Which are the geopolitical interests of Russia in this context withArgentina?
In the last week of January, President Fernandez announced the end of thelong negotiation with theInternational Monetary Fund(IMF)to restructure the US$45 million that the Fund had lent to the Mauricio Macri administration.
The negotiation was tough. However, the government was able to negotiate a program that did not include the standard “orthodox” policies of debt restructuring – the latter usually include a reduction of budget for pensioning and social policies as well as a reform of the labor market. Against all odds, IMF Managing Director Kristina Georgieva allowed the government to restructure its deficit without forcing apoliticalagenda. The Argentinian government has indeed agreed toreduce the fiscal deficitto 2,5% in 2022, 1,9% in 2023, and 0,9% in 2024.
Despite the optimistic announcement of the President, members of the Frente de Todos coalition weren’t as enthusiastic as their pairs. The tension was implicit when the vice President, Cristina Kirchner, did not say a word to celebrate the end of the negotiations. The first hit was from her son, Maximo Kirchner – majority leader of the coalition in Congress, who, in hisletter of resignation, affirmed that the responsibility of the agreement was of the President and his team, and assured he shared neither the way that the pact was negotiated nor its results. The whole situation resembles the one described last September (you can read more about it here), in which the whole Kirchner faction resigned due to the legislative election results. However, in this opportunity, the crisis was just circumscribed to the Vice-President’s son and his position as majority leader. He assured that he could not continue representing the coalition in congress if he did not share the economic goals of the government.
In spite of the fact that the whole situation risks endangering the success of the negotiations – especially because the agreement has to be approved by Congress, President Fernandez remained calm and revealed on national TV that Maximo’s decisionwas not approved by the Vice President. The President thus chose a new majority leader for the government’s coalition in congress, and of course, one of his trust.
As we mentionedbefore, drums of war were rumbling since last November, the political consensus was on thin ice, and the Kirchner faction has the feeling that the President has stabbed them in the back.Alberto Fernandezwas seen as a weak President, hostage of his coalition associates. But by turning over the table, the Kirchner faction is forced to face a dilemma. Will they admit that they were wrong in choosing Alberto Fernandez as President or support the IMF arrangement against their own ideals? Meanwhile, Vice-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner still has to announce her official position.
Last February, the Argentine President visited the Russian leaderVladimir Putin. The political opposition in Argentina was critical, arguing that the diplomatic move meant walking away from the Western sphere. The Russian bear is very interested in making his sphere of influence bigger in Biden’s“front yard”. Just weeks later,the Russian leader met with Brazilian President Bolsonaro, in an indiscrete move to bring the isolated alt-right leader under his wing.
Vladimir Putinappears to have permanent interests in Argentina. With strategic investments in nuclear power, logistics, andoil exploitationand a growing economic exchange, the Russian leader was not scared to show his pragmatism by advancing his interests even during the Macri administration. The supply ofSputnik V vaccinesand itsproduction in Argentinain the Fernandez government can be comparable to his aid during the ARA San Juan submarine crisis in the Macri administration, all gestures that reveal the long-term strategy of seduction from the Kremlin.
So, did Fernandez invent Vodka with Fernet? Or was it Vladimir Putin’s mix?
It is likely that the former KGB intelligence officer will offer his help in the following IMF negotiations, especially in the Argentine President’s interest in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR, orDerechos Especiales de Giro–DEG) that the Fund opens to developing countries. In a public address, Fernandez enthusiastically added thathe will open the doors of Latin America through Argentina to Russia. This influence could be observed when Argentina supplied Paraguay and Bolivia with Putin’s trademark, Sputnik V. The Russian leader seems to be in turn interested in gaining international support especially now with hismilitary enterprise in Ukraine.
After meeting Vladimir Putin, Alberto Fernandez proceeded to meet his most important business partner, Xi Jinping,during the Chinese winter games, where he met with Vladimir Putin once again. Although Vodka and Fernet are not compatible as a mix, this unusual combination could offer many novel avenues in geopolitical ties.

[BOOK REVIEW] Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment,"In 2014, the New York Times bestselling author of The Origins of Political Order and American political scientist Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama published his analysis of “identity politics” in “Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment.”Content Writer Mariana Henriques Martinsreviews the book for TNGO.
The type of identity politics increasingly practiced on both the left and the right is deeply problematic because it returns to understandings of identity based on fixed characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and religion, which had earlier been defeated at great cost.
Identity Politics has been dominating the political arena. The demand for recognition of certain marginalized and shared aspects of our identity has sparked a radical and essential transformation in the world of politics. Francis Fukuyama’sIdentity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politic of Resentmentoffers an explanation for this turn of perspective. One of the main concerns of his work is to clarify the rise of the right-wing populist-nationalist forces in many parts of the western world in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, such as inRussia,Hungary,Poland, and theUS, and many others whose radical right parties, albeit not in power, are gaining space in the parliaments.
It comes as no surprise to Fukuyama the failure of the class-based left to hinder the rise of the nationalist and religious parties or politicians in the second decade of the twentieth-first century. According to the author, “parties of the left have been losing out to nationalists for well over a hundred years, precisely among those poor or working-class constituencies that should have been their most solid base of support”. The class-based left, once eager to address socioeconomic inequalities, gradually became, throughout the 90s, accepting of the market economy and, consequently, closer to their center-right counterparts.
Besides, throughout the years, the nature of the fight has dramatically changed. If once the collectivist nature of the working-class struggle for better conditions was at the core of the left-wing parties’ motivations, today, there is an ever more emphasis on identity, be it nation or religion on the right, or marginalized/ underrepresented groups on the left. The author believes understanding this shift in the political scenery can shed a light on the initial thorny question.
Francis Fukuyama introduces the reader to the link betweenidentityandeconomic motivations. Dignity and recognition (the ancient Greek concept ofthymos) are directly affected by injustice. The author asserts that “salary is a marker of dignity”, as well as “a matter of recognition”: to be poor is to be invisible to others, and invisibility can be more atrocious to human beings than economic difficulties. To prove his point, the author gives the example of a woman who is promoted in a law firm but still gets 10 percent less than her male colleagues. Her demand for equality is less about the economic resources than it is about dignity and justice.
The connection between these two concepts – identity and monetary conditions – can enlighten the reader on the triumph of nationalist or religious conservatives to attract such a high number of followers in comparison to the left-wing parties based on economic class struggles. The formers validated their followers’ sense of identity (either through nation or religion) beyond addressing an economic issue. In essence, people’s religious or national identity entitles them to an economic position that was lost, and, for that reason, their social status and personal dignity are threatened. Fukuyama argues thatimmigration, regardless of its potential positive impact on a countries’ economy, is a current aspect in the identity politics of the right precisely because of the point just made. Immigration is assumed to threaten people’s cultural identity and who they are as members of a country. As stated by the author,
When economic decline is interpreted as a loss of social status, it is easier to see why immigration becomes a proxy for economic change.
Nonetheless, Fukuyama does not consider this the best explanation for the ascension of the nationalist right in the last years. During the twentieth century, the leftist parties were effective to answer the economic demands instigated by technological developments andglobalization. They have also appealed to a shared struggle for recognition in a capitalist system that exploits and oppresses the working class. In theUnited States, for example, the proletarian class supported the Democratic Party from the 1930s until the ascension ofRonald Regan. Then, what happened? Why is the left losing its followers to nationalist parties? According to the author, the roots of this dilemma can be found in the identity politics of the contemporary left. Fukuyama believes the problem with the contemporary left has been their choice to extol particular identity groups, oftentimesin favorof universal and equal recognition.
In the chapter “Democratization of Dignity”, Fukuyama associates the birth of the modern understanding of identity in politics with the therapeutic turn of the 1960s. It promoted a widespread celebration of self-esteem, imbued in social policy in the US, other liberal democracies, and the Universities’ curriculum. Fukuyama sees the modern sense of identity as the heir of the western eighteenth-century Russeauvian idea that “we have deep interior spaces whose potentialities are not being realized, and that external society through its rules, roles, and expectations is responsible for holding us back”. During the therapeutic turn, it became notorious that the need for individual self-realization was superior to society’s requirements and pressures.
The model was targeted with acute criticism. The scholar Christopher Lasch, for example, was concerned with the potential narcissism embedded in the new stress on self-esteem. Also, Lasch claimed this model could incite emotional dependence instead of a viable individual liberation, and the assertion of psychological problems as a substitute for the fight for social justice. Despite the criticism, the new therapeutic model inevitably intruded into politics, which gradually instituted the struggle for recognition and dignity. Modern democracies assumed the role of improving their citizen’s self-esteem, which, in turn, incited a backlash from the more conservative side (such as Nixon and Reagan, in the US). Fukuyama concludes that the therapeutic model was the spur of modern identity politics in liberal democracies.
Similar to the right-wing identity politics centered onreligionand nation (which was arguably a reaction to the contemporary left identity politics), these modern identities are often validated by an individual’s sameness to other people:group identity. According to Fukuyama, there are two options available for a group identity to connect with the external mainstream world: demanding society to see them as members of a group that deserves to be identically treated to the mainstream, dominant group; or, demanding to be seen, recognized, and respected as a separate identity from the mainstream, with a lived experience that is inaccessible to those out of the group identity. The author alerts the reader to the negative implications of the latter option overrunning in current politics.
In any circumstance does Fukuyama rejects the importance of embracing identity politics. He considers it to be fundamental the extension of equal recognition to every group identity, “a natural and inevitable response to injustice”. Theracial equality movement,the feminist movement, the sexual revolution movement,the environmental movement, the minority, and immigrant rights movement,the LGBTQI+ rights movement, the disability rights movement, all of these emerged from the vital need to make liberal democracies equally recognize the dignity of all citizens. Each of these movements intends to represent people that were invisible and marginalized over the years, and incite a public understanding of their intrinsic value, or, in other words, a recognition of their self-esteem.
Still, Fukuyama argues that an overfocus on identity politics (both the left and the right) can be problematic in some respects. Firstly, it can become a substitute for discussing socio-economic inequality. The author points out a decrease in socio-economic reforms aspirations with the adoption by the contemporary left of identity and multicultural politics in the last decades of the twentieth century. Secondly, Fukuyama claims that overfocusing on a narrow, marginalized group diverts the attention from older and larger groups that are dealing with economic difficulties and, therefore, inevitably feel invisible and unimportant. Subsequently, this might motivate them to embrace the right-wing side of identity politics to feel heard and seen. Indeed, the nationalist/ religious right has adopted the same language and identity locus of the left in its politics: the idea that their group is being underrepresented and their suffering is invisible to the mainstream social structure, which, in turn, needs to be held accountable and, ideally, dismantled. The author concludes,
Liberal democracies have good reasons not to organize themselves around a series of ever-proliferating identity groups inaccessible to outsiders. The dynamic of identity politics is to stimulate more of the same, as identity groups begin to see one another as threats. Unlike fights over economic resources, identity claims are usually nonnegotiable: rights to social recognition based on race, ethnicity, or gender are based on fixed biological characteristics and cannot be traded for other goods or abridged in any way.
Fukuyama believes identities can be useful in current politics. However, the author proposes thinking about identity in a more inclusive way: to define “larger and more integrative national identities that take account of thede factodiversity of existing liberal democratic societies.” The author goes on to explain how national identities can be divorced from the bad connotation of ethnonationalism, which is exclusive and intolerant. Instead, he suggests the basis of a new meaning for national identities, one that is built according to liberal and democratic political values. He also presents a way to do it.
Fukuyama’s work might not be the fully noncontroversial approach one dreams of in a potential solution for the tense and close-minded dialogue predominating current politics. However, in his work, the reader will find new insights, ideas, and understandings of the modern sense of identity and its prevalent influence in political and cultural discourse.

"[ANALYSIS] Once More Into the Storm: The West, Russia & the European Geo-Security Order","“To give security to these countless homes, they must be shielded from the two giant marauders, war and tyranny.” This excerpt from Winston Churchill’s famous‘Iron Curtain Speech’from 1946 provides a comprehensive insight into the possible return of armed conflict and destabilizing effects to the post-Cold War European geo-security order. With Russian PresidentVladimir Putinamassing an invading force of 130,000 on the borders ofUkraine, the West is yet again on the edge of possible military escalation and a wider Pan-European war. Coupled with Putin’sunambiguous demandsforNATO, it is clear that Europe’s geo-security order is under threat.
To showcase its resolve to Putin’s hard power politics and avoid similar results that occurred from his annexation of Crimea in 2014, theUnited States,France, theUnited Kingdom, andGermanyhave all participated in one-on-one meetings with the Russian president to deescalate the Ukrainian Crisis while pledging support for Ukraine’s territorial and political sovereignty – a strategic conundrum for NATO and the European geo-security order. To avoid war and maintain its vital assurances for regional peace and prosperity, the West needs to become more assertive in protecting, promoting, and procuring the post-Cold War European geo-security order to the continent. Moreover, the West needs to collectively disclose to Putin that his belligerent and draconian fearmongering will not be tolerated and that it has no place in the geo-security architecture of Europe.
The ongoing crisis along the Ukrainian border is nothing new in Putin’s foreign policy, and the recent military build-ups should be seen as the second stage in Putin’s desire for exerting greater power and authority over Russia’s “sphere of influence.” Dating back to 2013, Putin haspersistently bulliedUkraine and its political leaders to align more with Moscow and reverse any political and economic integration with the European Union. However, the idea of a“common Soviet past”or a shared ‘Rus’ history and culture has little importance for the Ukrainian people.
With the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, Putin feared a more pro-West and pro-European Ukraine. Perceiving an opportunity to intervene in the domestic affairs of Ukraine, due to the 2014 “overthrow” of then-President Victor Yanukovych, Putin launched a military invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Citing his presidential duty to protect allethnic Russians in Crimea, a group representing 60 percent of the peninsula’s population, Putin justified the annexation witha referendumthat showcased the Crimean population, supporting his decision to incorporate the peninsula into the Russian state.
The political results of Russia forcefully annexing Crimea in defence of ethnic Russians – citizens and native speakers – had important consequences for theDonetsk and Luhansk regionsof eastern Ukraine. With both regions housing pro-Russian separatists, violence soon broke out between the Ukrainian military and the Russian-backed separatist. Although denying its involvement, the conflict has provided Putin with another opportunity to interfere in the domestic affairs of Ukraine bystationing Russian military troops and equipmentnear the Donetsk region, along with the allegedcross-border shellingby Russian military forces.
To avoid a regional war, France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine concluded hostilities through theMinsk II Peace Plan, 13 key points that ranged from an immediate and full ceasefire in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to a constitutional reform in Ukraine that would take account of the special status of certain parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
The Minsk Peace Plan, however, was short-lived. Between late March and April 2021, Putin instructed the Russian military to mobilize significant quantities of its military towards the Ukrainian border. Moreover, in an almost prelude to his strategic actions, Putin wrote an essay in the summer of 2021,“On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,”that laid out his intentions for absorbing Ukraine by claiming that the two countries are “one people” and reinforcing that Ukraine’s “true sovereignty” can only be achieved in partnership with Russia.
After amassing a force of 130,000 on Ukraine’s borders, Putin claimed that he had information ofUkraine deploying 125,000 troopsto the Donbas region – a claim denounced as disinformation by the Ukrainian foreign minister. A more plausible reason for Putin’s military advance may have to do with theslow responsefrom Ukraine in following through with the Minsk II Peace Plan. As such, Putin may be using the threat of military force as a way to oblige Ukraine’s government to fully implementhis interpretation of the agreement, along with solidifying Russian de facto authority over Ukraine’s foreign policy.
As Putin continues to escalate his military posture towards Ukraine, the West has sought an audience with the Russian president to avoid further armed conflict and political destabilization. Seeing that his recent power projection has granted an audience with the US, NATO, and other key European powers, Putin proposed adraft treatyof demands in December 2021 for renewed regional peace and a solution to the Ukrainian Crisis. Citing Russia’shistorical grievancesof NATO expansionism in the 1990s and 2000s and the belief that theWest has fomentedcrisis after crisis in the post-Soviet bloc by instilling anti-Russian sentiment and supplying weapons, Putin demands that the West recognize and affirm Russia’s geo-security concerns with the existing European geo-security order – placing Russia as a prominent regional geo-security architect.
To accomplish this task,Putin demandedthat NATO withdraw its military infrastructure placed in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet bloc, along with awritten guaranteefrom NATO never to expand farther east – essentially ending Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty. What is more, Putin demanded that NATO formally revoke thepromise of membershipto Ukraine and Georgia made at the 2008 NATO Bucharest Summit. Putinfurthered his demandsto include a mutual restriction on the deployment of short- and medium-range missiles and a ban on military exercises exceeding the strength of a brigade alongside NATO’s eastern flank and greater information sharing on military exercises.
Although Putin’s demands concerning NATO, its members, and its military footprint were dismissed, some analysts fear that talks between Russia and the West on geo-security guarantees areset up for diplomatic failure, thereby permitting Putin legitimate grounds for war in Ukraine. What is more, some fear that Putin desires the return of Russia to the glory days of the Soviet Union in territorial, military and political terms. At first glance, his demands for NATO to stop its eastern expansion and the revocation of its military footprint to all former Soviet Republics may reinforce this notion.
However, these fears are misplaced.Today, Russia remainsa top military and nuclear power globally, the largest territorial country in the world, and can project its hard and soft power on regional and global geopolitical settings. If President Putin desires a return to the glory days of the Soviet Union, he need not look any further.
It is important to remember that President Putin has extensive memories of the Soviet Union as the second superpower in a regional and global bipolar order. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the newly reconstituted Russia fell in global ranking and lost control of Eastern Europe. More importantly, these events, coupled with the failure of the early Russian leadership to prevent NATO’s absorption of the Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet space, solidified Russia’s defeat in overseeing parts of the European geo-security order. Today, Putin’s Russia only has sweeping de facto dominance and influence over the Caucasus and a small periphery of Eastern Europe, as demonstrated by theCollective Security Treaty Organization(CSTO), Russia’smoderating rolein the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (you can read our article on the topic here) and propping up the legitimacy of Belarusian dictatorAlexander Lukashenko.
The realities of Putin’s demands to NATO and his military belligerence to Ukraine have a lot to do with his obsession with regaining the titular recognition of being a great European power, along with equal global status to the US and China. What is more, it is clear from Putin’s strategic impulse that he seeks to install Russia’s geo-security concerns onto the European geo-security order, thus legitimizing his territorial, ideological, and structural notions of state-centric interests and power.
Analysts also suggest that Putin desires the return of a Cold War geo-security structure of power that cancounter the advancementof the West’s institutional, economic and military integration, in effect reviving a Soviet bloc equipped with pro-Russian elites. Although this is possible, it does not fit the Russian leader’s near-term goals for regaining great power status and repealing the architecture that governs the European geo-security order.
More likely, Putin seeks to halt NATO expansion in hopes of sketching out a ‘sphere of influence’ that will position Russia as a great power andregional mediator and security guarantorto non-NATO countries and who happen to harbour undemocratic and authoritarian regimes. This development would safeguard Russia’s western borders with existing NATO members, thereby allowing Putin to achieve greater concessions from an isolated Ukraine while deepening diplomatic, political, and even military interoperability with the Balkans.
With such influence in the“soft underbelly”of Europe, Putin could place strategic military assets near major US and NATO bases, haveaccess to the Adriatic Seaand generate a more pro-Slavic and pro-Orthodox fraternity that would be easier to manage, reinforce, control, and align with Moscow’s national interests. In essence, Putin could initiate a geopolitical game of quid pro quo with NATO, the major European powers, and the US with these newly established geo-security bases.
To paint President Putin as a warmonger or an authoritarian dictator bent on reviving the Soviet Union at all costs does not give the Russian leader significant credit for his longevity as a political figurehead. For instance, Putin has remained president of Russia while all of the West’s political leaders have been replaced, a challenging feature for diplomatic agreements and treaties to remain potent over time. Moreover, Putin acknowledges thatRussia’s population and its level of skillsare decreasing, thereby forcing him and the regime to shift Russia’s long-term goals to the near-term. In a stroke of luck, Putin’s near-term goals fall when the US is pivoting its strategic outlook towards the Indo-Pacific and China, European liberal-democracies are eroding and growing intra-alliance friction among NATO members.
Putin’s calculated demands have come at a particular time in the West’s history. Revamping from the previous Trump presidency, US President Joe Biden has underpinned NATO and Europe’s geo-security order asthe heart of the Western alliance, in particular, reiterating NATO’s Article V as a“sacred obligation.”However, with his administration’s over lurking presence in the Indo-Pacific to counter Chinese regional hegemony, many NATO allies and Putin observe that Europe is in America’s rearview.
Putin also recalls the lastUkrainian conflictin 2014 and the low ball reactions to his annexation of Crimea by the US and NATO allies. Observing Putin’s belligerent actions against Ukraine, former US President Barack Obama positioned Russia as a lone regional power that was threatening its neighbours, and as a result, not anational security threat. After recognizing the reality that Putin violated Ukrainian territorial and political sovereignty, along with international law, Obama placedeconomic sanctionson Russian officials. Coupled with US sanctions and Europe’s haste to sign the Minsk Peace Plan, with thefirst Minsk treaty collapsingwithin days of its signing, it is unequivocal to see why Putin was not reluctant to amass a large force on the Ukrainian border.
The West has also stalled to collectively deal with the Ukrainian Crisis by having its major powers – the US, France, UK, and Germany – establish one-on-one interviews, meetings, and summits with Putin. Rather than resolving the situation, theseunilateral deals have emboldenedPutin’s demands and military action. What is more, these dealings accolade more optics of Russia being a great power and on par with the US is managing and influencing the European geo-security order. It also reinforces Putin’s belief that the West, particularly the US, is awaning power blocincapable of facing hard power intimidations from Russia, making the West seemingly afraid to confront Putin when he pushes or threatens with force. As a result, these inactions have precipitated Putin to heighten his offensive antics and rhetoric.
Intra-alliance friction is also at play when dealing with Putin. Instead of uniting as a single collective organization of like-minded allies, NATO – under the leadership of the US – has marginalized its Eastern European members by having certain groups within the Alliance as primary and secondary affiliates. For instance,US President Bidenhas on multiple occasions contacted theBucharest Nineto signal the US resolute commitment to NATO’s eastern flank and reassurance of deterring Russia while, at the same time, usingthe NATO Quint– primarily France, UK, and Germany – to negotiate with Putin directly. It is incomprehensible to see why the West would negotiate with Putin without directly involving the Eastern European states that have the most to lose if Russia invades Ukraine. Lastly, these diplomatic maneuvers posture NATO’s eastern flank and the countries that make it up in an almost compromised position, feeling as though they are expandable if Russia intimidates Europe in the future.
Friction among the West also extends to all levels of powers, ranging from the Nord Stream 2 debate among the major NATO powers; Germany’s reigning governmental coalition havingdomestic divisionson a response; thepolarization and gridlockof the US Senate to ratify any treaty conditions; and more recently,Germany blocking Estoniafrom providing German-made weapons to Ukraine.
For the West to thrive against Putin’s growing belligerence, it must collectively come together. Luckily for the West, there is NATO. It is undeniable that NATO is the most successful military and political alliance in history. To capitalize on its success, the West needs to make NATO its primary institutional tool to deter and defend the transatlantic region by becoming more assertive in its relationship and conduct to Putin.
The first move NATO needs to make is to upgrade and contribute significant military troops, equipment, and infrastructure to its eastern flank. Due to the US pivot towards the Indo-Pacific and other NATO members not fully investing in their militaries, Putin now commands a significant number oftanks, cruise missiles, and troopsthat outmatches the existing NATO military contingent that forms the Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) on its eastern flank.
To overcome this setback, NATO needs toreopen allied air and ground basesthat can station the Alliance’s vast array of troops and fighter jets, along with reinforcing and creating newair force combat squadronsthat can deploy at a moments notice to defend the territorial sovereignty and airspace of the Alliance’s members. What is more, NATO needs tobolster alliedground forces, armour divisions, and missile defence batteries.
NATO should also seek funding from the US and other NATO members to amplify its military posture to its eastern and southern flank by formalizing a functional readiness program that reflectsthe ‘Four Thirties” initiative. The US should reinforce this program by encouraging the EU to invest inmajor military acquisitionsto fill early readiness gaps that will reduce NATO’s European members’ full dependency on the US. In turn, the US would have ample time to amass a significant military force that could enhance the European contingent. For this to work, however, the US must maintain a sizable conventional force that can support NATO’s European members in military logistics and operational command.
NATO also needs to update its conventional arsenal of defensive weapons, ranging from traditional ground forces to drones and tanks, tactically placed Integrated Air and Missile Defence installations, and military infrastructure. The latter of these updates is crucial as it will permit NATO forces toimprove military mobility and transportation capabilitiesthat can swiftly and efficiently send vast detachments of troops and tanks to the eastern flank, effectively cutting off any attempts for Putin to gain a strategic and territorial advantage.
The West should also halt all public communique and one-on-one meetings with Putin. It is apparent that the Russian leader seeks equal footing with the West through public discourse. By threatening Ukraine or Europe, Putin knows that the West will quickly respond to any threats. As a result, these immediate efforts undermine the West’s strategic posture to Putin and prevent the West from effectively planning for force deployment and military support, potentially being used instead as a provocation for Putin to carry out armed attacks.
Instead, under NATO, the West should snub Putin of an easy victory by not publicly reacting to his antagonistic demands. NATO should only interact with Putin through back and close door diplomacy. Through such diplomatic maneuvers, NATO could be more assertive to Putin, detailing that any attack or further aggression would result in more hard power responses – extensive military buildups to the Alliance’s eastern flank,banning Russian shipsfrom Western ports, andsuspending any geo-securitytalks. These assertive proclamations would demonstrate to Putin the collective readiness and staunch assurance of NATO in upholding its treaty obligations and preserving its territorial sovereignty against any possible Russian military advances. At the same time, closed-door talks would also avoid putting Putin into a corner, thereby allowing him not to lose face amongst the Russian people and influential officials in his regime.
Lastly, with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg likely stepping down as the Alliance’s leader, the West should unanimously elect a new Secretary-General from the post-Soviet sphere, particularly the Baltics. Although the Baltic states have beencalled fearmongers, their apprehension of Putin is well-founded in their country’s history with their eastern neighbour. Let us not forget that the Baltic states were occupied by the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union. Like many former Warsaw states, the Baltics have distinct memories of Soviet crackdowns on domestic protest and arbitrary arrests.
Fueled with memories like theHungarian Revolution of 1956, thePrague Spring in 1968, and theVilnius protest of 1991, a NATO Secretary-General from the post-Soviet sphere will bluntly declare to Putin that the West is fully dedicated to deter and defend Europe from the Russian leader. There are also logistical benefits to such a move as many people in the Baltics arefluent or native Russian speakers.A NATO leader with this credential would promptly convey to Putin that the West is“listening to what Russia says and believes it.”
“The safety of the world requires a new unity in Europe, from which no nation should be permanently outcast.”
For continued and uncompromised peace to flourish in Europe, the West can no longer ably sit by as a reactor to threats of military aggression.  Following this excerpt of Winston Churchill’s Sinews of Peace speech, NATO and its members must be clear amongst each other and to the rest of the world that the West is ready and willing to confront an aggressive Putin that seeks to undermine the European geo-security order for his own near-term goals.
Although such political, diplomatic, and military actions are challenging, even being seen as overtly hawkish, Putin is a byproduct of the Cold War and the Soviet Union, and as a result, understands and appreciates the power and might of the Alliance. After all, NATO endured Soviet advances and remains prevalent in the geo-security architecture of Europe. If the West can grasp the full potential of NATO and collectively interact with Putin, the strategic landscape that has plagued Eastern Europe would indeed be unlike anything that is now in play.","February 18, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-once-more-into-the-storm-the-west-russia-the-european-geo-security-order/,Andrew Erskine,thenewglobalorder.com,World News

Ghada Jamal: the Painter of the Lebanese’s Suffering and Hope,"The interview is part of the TNGO Investigative JournalismWomen’s Storiescolumn,an endeavor to highlight the stories of outstanding women in the areas covered by our journalists. In this article, the Director of TNGO’s Division of Investigative Journalism “The Second Voice,” Margaux Seigneur, talks with Lebanese artist Ghada Jamal during her exhibition “Belonging for 1990-2022” depicting the suffering and hopes of Lebanon.
In the middle of the frenetic Gemmayzeh Street, near the port of Beirut,  stands a majestic artistic temple;Art on 56th. Wrapped in a definite elegance, the charm of this building lets the hope of Lebanese art shine through. The artists wander, the paintings and drawings parade on the white walls, as for the pedestrians; they stop to contemplate the show.
Like an archipelago containing a comforting tenderness, Art on 56th is a barrage of Beirut’s magnificent chaos, promising a spotlight on Middle Eastern artists. We owe this gracious tribute to contemporary art to its founderNoha Wadi Moharram.
It is naturally in this art gallery that I am meeting with Ghada Jamal. Returned from the United States on the occasion of her exhibition; “Belonging for 1990-2022,” her comeback is extremely symbolic. Whilethe explosion of the portcaused the devastation of a large part of the city of Beirut, it is now the whole country that is bruised by an unprecedented economic crisis. For Ghada, who is used to depict the suffering of her native country, the emotion is palpable.
Indeed, the artist paints what she knows, what she has always lived in sum. The desolation of the civil war, the suffering of wars, the mourning of a nation after the Qana massacre, the bloody yet optimistic emotion of the Arab spring, the national wound of the port explosion, etc. Her art aims to bring to light the trauma of an entire community in its most bruised and tragic periods.
Witnessing a bloody relentlessness against her country, I wonder how the dramatic events, marking out Ghada’s existence, have impacted her conception of art in general.
“ I started painting when I was 26, 27 years old. By that time, my country was only at war. It was so strong, so powerful and it impacted so many people that it was impossible to simply describe it.  War was becoming my life. I was hearing it, living with it and so I had to cope with it. There was no other possible alternative. ”
Ghada pauses to reflect. She suddenly starts again with a mischievous smile;
“ I am not good with words.  So I  had to find a new language. I needed my work to be understood by everyone. I wanted more than just describing. My work had to be felt by the communities who were touched by the conflict. Painting and drawing certainly were and still are a way to find a balance between war and humanity. It answers the question of who we are, as humans, in the middle of the devastation caused by conflicts.”
“Art could tell something that words couldn’t. I wanted to paint aggressiveness and so I did. ”
While Ghada does not cease to paint the gaping wound of humanity, how not to question the difficulty of this task. How to consider the distance between the artist, the human, and the Lebanese whose existence has been marked by death?
“ I do very well under pressure.” She answers while laughing;
“ I need to be completely overwhelmed and pressured by a flood of emotion to paint and to draw.”
“While war kills people, it also kills the very essence of humanity.”
Facing the denial of mankind, Ghada had to stand up not only to protest but also to defend her existence as a human being. When there was only death around, bombs falling from the sky and crashing down everything, her paintbrushes were the only way to draw what survived.
“ During a hard time, when you are becoming nothing, you have to validate yourself so that you can exist. It is like a therapy that would play the role of validation; validation for your existence but also validation for your feelings. Because I only experienced suffering, I had to change the balance in order to cope with my existence.”
“ This is a basic technique of survival which led me to claim that I belong here!”
In your drawing series “Obscured fear”, Ghada puts a light on the common fear among the population due to the civil war. With all the recent dramatic events which tragically impacted Lebanon, the belief in a brighter future still lingers.
“ Well, I believe that the civil war is still here in the shadow, in the memories, in the houses, etc. We will never forget it. And so yes, I believe people are still afraid and will always be. The spirit of the civil war is still in the head of every single inhabitant.
The idea that everything can collapse is latent in the atmosphere and it weighs on the air we breathe. It is like civil war is negotiable. It is on the table like a flashing neon above our head.
So yes, I believe in this common fear which is not only a personal terror. You can overcome your personal terror but the macro fear is latent and can obstruct everything else. But I am not a pessimist person! Yes, you have to believe in a bright future for the new generation.  Personally, I put my hope in art. Art and landscapes will remain. They will teach people how to remember. It gives the means to contemplate your heritage and confront yourself with the present and the future. There will still be pieces of art that will shed light on what happened. And so it will never be forgotten.”
Ghada wrote; “I paint to repaint over again until I find refuge between its traces and remains”. When she painted Beirut after the blast, was it an attempt to pay tribute to the beauty of the chaos or an attempt to re-build the ruins?
“ The reality is that what happened was an unsaid, undeclared, and unreported war. No one knew what was happening and all the sudden we were under attack. In a split second, everything got destroyed and people were marked for eternity.Buildings became debris, destruction, and detritus. People were broken, injured, and traumatized. The ruins became part of our identity and will remain as such. So I wanted not only to pay tribute to the beauty of the ruins, the beauty of the spaces, and of the places but also re-build them to honor the people who rebuilt everything. I wanted full color!
This series was all about the beauty of the people who have suffered so much but survived it. This is what Lebanese people are; strong and resilient. Those paintings were about the beauty of the people of Beirut who build again and again despite all. This is their home, where they belong, where I belong. Beirut is Beirut only thanks to the will of its people. Such injured people still standing up. ”
Through her art and her determination to overstep the trauma with color, Ghada Jamal provides people with hope. Not only does she have an unprecedented talent to depict hope but also she transmits it to make sure that it survives time. Hope itself transcends the places and builds a connection with the past, the present, and the future. That might explain the ultimate desire of Ghada to draw and paint landscape; a timeless narrative in which hope will remain engraved.
Ghada Jamal’s art vouches for a long-suffering community that holds out hope and determination for its future. With acrylic, oil, charcoal, ink, and gouache, Ghada is depicting humanity surviving, remaining, and enduring despite all odds. Every single one of her pieces addresses the response to destruction and devastation. Therefore, Ghada puts herself as the reminder of the very right of the people of Lebanon and the people of the world; living with dignity. Carried by the communities of people who live and re-invent themselves, Ghada participates to transmit the essence of existence.
The constant perseverance of hope is what makesLebanonsuch a proud country and is what makes Ghada’s art reflect so well this spontaneous surge of humanity. Despite the apparent destruction of a country, people are existing, resisting and so they are belonging.","March 19, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-second-voice/ghada-jamal-the-painter-of-the-lebaneses-suffering-and-hope/,Margaux Seigneur,thenewglobalorder.com,The Second Voice
The Second Voice: Why are the French Feminists so Divided Compared to the Turkish’s Ones?,"In light of the revolutionary mobilization of Turkish feminists regarding the imprisonment ofÇilem Doğanfor the murder of her violent husband, French feminist collectives seem shy, divided, and torn by a partisan dynamic which damages the universal fight against violence against women.
A few months apart, in two courts separated by thousands of kilometres, two women are on trial for the murder of their respective husbands after having suffered repeated domestic violence and rape.
One of the defendants is French and the other is Turkish.
Also referred to as “the new Jacqueline Sauvage,” Valerie Bacot is a woman, who for 12 years was beaten, raped, and forced into prostitution by her ex-father-in-law, turned husband. It was on the night of 13 March 2016 that she killed him.
Immediately, public opinion was gripped by the case and media mobilization grew. A support committee was launched, as well as an online petition that created a real infatuation. Valérie Bacot became the new emblem of the fight against domestic violence and social networks supported her with hashtags; #libertépourvalérie (freedom for Valérie).
This formidable mobilization gained even more visibility when the lawyers Nathalie Tomasini and Janine Bonaggiunta, who had previously defended Jacqueline Sauvage, took up Bacot’s case.
In Turkey’s Adana province, Çilem Doğan’s story is disturbingly similar. On 8 March 2015, the young Turkish woman decided to end the domestic violence, forced prostitution and rape  she had suffered for years by killing her husband. She then pleads for self-defence.
Çilem quickly became a national symbol of violence against women in Turkey. Her story is widely reported. In the streets as well as on social media, Doğan’s name resonates and spreads. Hashtags of support multiplied; #CilemDogangururumuzdur (Çilem Doğan is our pride). A petition was launched and met with immediate success. Her letters written in prison were relayed throughout the country andher lawyersused their media influence to call for a general mobilization.
At the time of the verdicts, the silence is heavy. France and Turkey are holding their breath. The two women were found guilty.They each received symbolic sentences, but with very different meanings.
Valérie Bacot was given a four-year prison sentence, three of which were suspended, and will not return to prison. Çilem Doğan was sentenced to life imprisonment for the first time. Thanks to the persistence of her lawyers and the pressure exerted by the many feminist groups, she was eventually sentenced to fifteen years in prison.
In these two stories, there are similarities between France and Turkey which reiterate the sad universalism of domestic violence. One might be tempted to think that there is only one difference: the sentences handed down to the two victims for a similar crime were considerably different. However, it is necessary to highlight the differences between the mobilization of French andTurkish feminist collectivesto combat the common phenomenon of violence against women.
While Valérie Bacot and Çilem Doğan both benefited from extraordinary media, digital and popular mobilization, the organization of feminist collectives was totally opposed, confirming the fissuring of French feminist organizations.
“This trial was the trial of feminism against the barbarity of the state.” Testified Çilem Doğan’s lawyer during our interview.
In contrast to the French scenario, Çilem’s trial was not only the trial of a battered woman but of all Turkish women. Like the mobilization against the withdrawal of the Istanbul Convention, the conviction of Çilem Doğan was a new attack on women’s rights resulting in an unprecedented protest.
In Turkey, the consensus aroundthe fight to eliminate violence against womenis such that partisan, political, and ideological divides are being erased. When the Istanbul Convention was withdrawn, Turkish women’s and feminist organizations united together. Since then, this coalition remains. The ideological frictions are visible but by no means ludicrous. Even the feminist groups loyal to Erdogan are offended! They, who at first sight supported the vision of a conservative and religious Turkey, find themselves in the centre of the target at which the president is firing again.
From then on, a multitude of feminist bodies made up the single body of the demonstrations. Kurds, Muslims, atheists, students, LBGTQ+, anti-militarists, members of the conservative association KADEM, workers, environmentalists, socialists, etc. All shout the name of Doğan! In a country where it is not good to be a woman, the only message is unity; unity facing oppression.
All over Turkey, women are singing to the rhythm of the violations of their rights! They scream in the hope of being heard, of being listened to! Kurdish, Turkish, and even Armenian voices are heard together to defend the one who has not remained silent. The slogans intermingle, the speeches follow one another but the anger remains!
This colour of bitterness is far from being uniform in France.
While the collective Femmes Solidaires organized a demonstration on the steps of the courthouse in Périgueux, no other organizations joined the first one.
French women’s rights are certainly not subject to the same trends as those of Turkish women. However, domestic violence remains a patriarchal tradition in both countries. So why does French feminism fail to unify its fight and prefer a partisan division to a common struggle?
As Natacha Chetchti, a sociologist and anthropologist at INSEM commented; “Today each feminist group defends its own interests.”
While egalitarian feminists are accused of denying class domination, gender issues, and racism. Some favour debates on the veil and the burqa while others prefer to see racial domination as inclusive evil.
Those internal debates, therefore, lead to selecting a certain type of defence according to a specific of violence against specific categories of women.
However, domestic violence escapes the logic of a polarizing debate. Between the class struggle, the racial, sexist, religious, and sexual debate. There remains the homogeneous struggle of violence against women of all genders, classes, and origins, as in the Turkish revolutionary mobilization around Çilem Doğan.
The various French groups failed to seize the case of Valérie Bacot to organize a common response. If the story of this woman has indeed moved and mobilized public opinion, it has not triggered a movement of intra-party solidarity capable of bringing together the different feminisms of the country. Despite the possibility of union, feminist collectives seem to prefer to fight the global phenomenon of domestic violence separately.
Looking at the legacy of a common object of struggle handed down by Çilem Doğan, we ineluctably witness the partisan drift of French feminism of interest that is detrimental to the collective cause of women’s defence. This fracture confirms that if unity is indeed strength, then French feminism is headed for disaster.","February 09, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-second-voice/the-second-voice-why-are-the-french-feminists-so-divided-compared-to-the-turkishs-ones/,Margaux Seigneur,thenewglobalorder.com,The Second Voice
Can Civic Tech Flip the Script of Youth Participation in Elections in the SADC Region?,"At least six Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries are scheduled to hold elections within the next three years. Although elections represent a renewal or establishment of a social contract through voting, recent elections in southernAfricahave not enjoyed support from the youth.
TheAfrican Uniondefines youth as individuals aged 15–35 years. The growing youth voter apathy and disinterest in electoral processes beg for innovative interventions that will inspire the former to become active stakeholders and participants in the region’s democratization project.Civic tech, in the form of online portals and social media platforms,has the potential to unlock such innovation.
The general elections to be held inAngolaandLesothoin 2022,  in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC) andZimbabwein 2023, as well asBotswanaandSouth Africain 2024, require that the young people of these countries do not only engage in political activism -campaigns and protests- but also vote for political representatives or compete for political office. This is important since the youth constitute a significant proportion of the population of these nations (see Figure 1). Therefore, their votes, as well as their representation in political leadership positions will strengthen democracy.
History documents the pivotal role African youth played in political changes across the continent in the twentieth century – including South Africa’s liberation struggle. However, their participation in elections has been waning over the years, a development that isattributedto a myriad of challenges this group experiences including high unemployment, marginalization, and under-representation in government institutions and political leadership spaces, as well as questionable elections.
In countries likeMalawiandMozambique, for example, recent elections were defined by gross irregularities that questioned the credibility of their outcomes. And, in the case of the former, the courts were forced to intervene andoverturnthe results. Even in a country likeBotswana, which for decades has taken pride in being the beacon of African democracy, recent events point to worrying signs in the country’s democratization efforts. An unprecedented number ofpetitionsbrought against the 2019 elections, as well as concerns that a recentfloor crossinglegislation may have been designed to arrest the declining political fortunes of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), highlight growing deficiencies in Botswana’s democracy. These occurrences evidently erode trust in electoral processes.
It is also worth noting that political discourses that take place on civic tech platforms likeFacebookandTwitter– where most young people interact – serve to compound these challenges.Civic tech can thus be seen as a double-edged swordthat exacerbates apathy and disinterest in young voters, but also has the potential to make political processes attractive and accessible to this constituency.  The main challenge for the region’s pro-democracy advocates then is to come up with innovative measures to harness the democratic possibilities of civic tech while mitigating its adverse effects on youth involvement in the political process.
There areseveral determinantsof youth participationin elections in SADC.
Zimbabwe’s 2018 increase in youth voter turnout when compared to 2013, for example, could have been a response to legitimize Emmerson Mnangagwa’s rule after the 2017 coup. The euphoria of an anticipated new dawn, in the context of deteriorating socio-economic conditions, might have also catalyzed the high youth voter turnout. In Botswana, the Independent Electoral Commission cites increased youth participation in electoral cycles from 21% in 2004 to 41% in 2019, owing to increasing political engagements on social networking sites – Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, amongst others.
On the other hand, Lesotho and Angola experienced a decline of said voters in the 2017 general election;political dynamicscontributed to youth disinterest in Lesotho’s case, while the latter had voter’s rollirregularitiesthat relocated most voters to polling stations that they had not registered to vote at. This is likely to have inconvenienced and demoralized the youth, forcing many to stay away from the ballot box.
South Africa’s case of decreased youth voter turnout over the past six electoral cycles, reached a significant decline in 2019. As explained in a study by Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, this phenomenon was a result of the difficulty in mobilizing the youth population, low attachment or loyalty to political parties, negative economic evaluations, and low levels of political representatives’ responsiveness to the young electorate’s interests.
The ongoing electoral cycles are confronted with new challenges pertaining to civic and voter education in the face ofCOVID-19. This is because minimized face-to-face civic and voter education activities in a bid to curb Covid-19 will only serve to perpetuatemisinformationand youth voter apathy. The heightened distrust in government administrations and bureaucratic institutions to deliver on public goods, as well as rising corruption, amongst others, will also affect youth’s voter turnout in the upcoming elections.
As such, taking advantage of civic tech is important for all concerned stakeholders – i.e., governments, electoral management bodies (EMBs) political parties, civil society organizations (CSOs), the private sector, and the youth itself– to intensify election messaging, voter education, and dissemination of accurate, reliable information on electoral cycles. This will attemptedly counter misinformation while allowing political parties and election management bodes to reach a large proportion of the youth population.
For these civic tech initiatives to be successful,governments providing free data to their electorate will play a pivotal role.Although communication and technology infrastructure is available in most countries, not everyone can afford data allowances for a stable or high-quality connection. Therefore, providing data will afford the youth electorate access to civic tech tools. It cannot be emphasized enough what civic tech can achieve to boost youth confidence and trust in electoral processes. Mozambique, for example, is already usingCitizen’s EyeandTxeka-lá, as well as theVotar Mozambique web platform and its mobile app to monitor polls in real time. This serves to curb electoral irregularities and enhances participation.
To address challenges limiting youth participation in elections in each of the selected SADC countries, civic tech interventions should be specific, as demonstrated in the table below:
Southern Africa’s communication and technology infrastructure can support civic tech initiatives to increase youth participation in elections. It is left for governments and other stakeholders to maximize available tools to influence and attract this demography to vote, as part of the measures to strengthen democracy in the region.

The False Dilemma Between State or Market,"The globalization process has been cataloged as one of“the most important features in the international system”and the clearest consequence is the new standards and forms in which the capital moves throughout the state’s borders. Despite the several analytical perspectives trying to understand this phenomenon, since 1970, the economic, financial, and productive capitalism platforms have acquired more and more degrees of globalism. The social, economic, and political linkages between countries, multinational companies, and non-profit organizations are increasingly deep.
Within the studies of globalization or the international economic system, there has always been an inherent tension between the market’s search to generate more transnational flows, while the State seeks to circumscribe them and limit their global movement. Nowadays, this tension continues to exist, but given the complexities of global risks and global interconnectivity, the Nation-States must reformulate their capacity, scope, and organizational structures toward new modalities of public-private insertion.
In order to have an accurate picture of how certain countries and multinational companies have developed, it is important to comprehend their economic and social growth. Inside the entrepreneurial and free-market rhetoric, there are several well-known examples such as Silicon Valley,Apple, and Meta, as well as the economic evolution of theUnited States,Great Britain,South Korea, et sim. but what is behind those experiences? Was the private sector the only one in charge of economic development? What role does the state have in social-economic trends? Are the well-known examples only private interventions or do public-private alliances explain the success? From this perspective, how can we think about theGlobal South?
TheCOVID-19 pandemichas showcased high levels of asymmetry worldwide. Not only is the total percentage of the population vaccinated per million inhabitants −especially inAfrica− but also the socio-economic impacts derived from economic retraction and the geo-economic reconfiguration of the value chains. In short, although the scale of effects has been completely different depending on the country’s financial and organizational capacity, we can see a deficiency in how governmental leadership has organized and defined lockdowns. The current decoupling between the social, economic, and environmental spheres is a deficit way of thinking of states and markets as opposite actors. Even nowadays, a large list of countries has serious difficulties defining and wisely deploying their resources. Perhaps the root of this problem was the lack of importance given to state capabilities.
These binary elections −many times strengthen by some political discourses of free-market policies− have minimized what the state knew how to do historically. Without seeking to elaborate on a pro-state vision, it is relevant to recognize the importance that the state has had on great historic events, and how, in this interconnected world, public-private alliances have been key to achieving economic and social results.
From the Industrial Revolution to other prominent socio-economic policies in theUnited States,France,Germany,South Korea,Japan, andChina, public-private alliances have always been critical to success. Inside free-market and private entrepreneurial spheres, the more open the markets are, the more successful a public policy or economic performance. However, history is more complex than this binary rhetoric. The above countries, whose economic development has been of relevancy, are examples of deep public-private alliances. In these cases, the state has been thought of as a socio-political organization with rational autonomy that rests on thinking, analyzing, and executing public policies together with the private sector.
According toKicking Away the Ladder(2002), a famous economic book written by Han Joon Chang, a Korean expert on economic development, we can observe how most of today’s industrialized countries have mobilized resources from the public sector, together with the private sector. Paradoxically, Chang’s book title alludes to the fact that today, given the technological-productive frontier that industrialized countries have reached, those who have the socio-economic status they venerate as the optimum to follow, are the same ones that have systemically denied developing countries − with pretensions to scale economically− the recipes that led them to their current success. The worldwide influence ofGreat Britain(1760-1840) and then the United States (1945-2000) are clarifying examples of how the state, via tariff and non-tariff measures, and investment in science and technology, has been an important contributor to economic growth.
In light of Mariana Mazzucato’s book Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism (2021), we can observe how the United States has developed a robust public-private partnership since the Apolo 11 mission that has had very positive effects in terms of “productive, scientific, and organizational synergies and interlinkages” (2021; 87). From Black and Decker, Motorola, and General Motors to derived technologies such as the internet, solar panels, cellphone cameras, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and water purification technology, medical and magnetic resonance imaging, “the Apollo 11 program and its association with private companies spawned many important innovations” (2021; 89). Without the state’s participation and positioning, the economic and social synergies between NASA, DARPA, and the extensive productive, scientific and academic network wouldn’t have been possible.
It is important to consider previous macroeconomic and socio-political tensions in each country. The U.S has had important economic and financial resources and assumed several risks, but the most valuable contribution according to Mazzacuto is the importance of thinking in intergenerational state capacities and their interdepartmental communication infrastructures −between the private sector, universities, technological scientists, etc.
In a schematic way, the Interpreturial State might be understood as an organizational and technical corpus whose most prominent features are technical, organizational, and management competencies with a proactive attitude to have leadership, vision, innovation, and flexibility. In most industrialized countries, the Entrepreneurial State has understood that “the principal role of the economy is the direction and not to speed” (Mazzucato, 2021). Nowadays, in a world full of uncertainty, geo-economic readjustments, and techno-social advances, with implications in endless spheres, it is important to understand that the role of the State must be to develop a clear, pragmatic, and programmatic vision to complement the private sector. However, these features are results of tangible and intangible capital. The Apollo 11 mission is an illuminating summary of hundreds of these valuable features. From billions of dollars in innovation and the assumption of risks to expensive technological rockets or devices; as well as the restructuration of organizations such as NASA and DARPA to its connections with prominent universities. Being aware of the material and immaterial asymmetries that countries have, it is important to keep in mind these policies to implement in the Global South.
Given the importance of leading a set of green public policies whose approach is holistic, gradual, participatory, realistic but pragmatic, Argentina has relevant capacities to position itself as a country of reference in the region, though it lacks a solid-state capacity to improve its results.
In the short term, the “mission approach” is a possible economic exit to select and improve certain spheres. Argentina has several outstanding industries with a strong future ahead such as lithium, nuclear energy, and renewable energies. According to several official studies, even ECLAC has shown the potential of eolic, solar, and lithium capacity to be one of the most promising productive-green poles in the region (2018). Nowadays, only having natural resources is not enough. These critical industries need to have a political, strategic, and systemic approach. The explanation of each industry exceeds the aim of this work, but it is critical to understand how this “mission approach” could work in the country.
Worldwide, we can observe tangible and intangible capital in industries of the future. Therefore, Argentina must improve “its organizational dynamic” and horizontal decision-making architecture, to build gradual, pragmatic, and participatory public policies. Historically, the country has had dismal macroeconomic results; in addition to a misuse of public funds that did not allow financing policies in the long term. The ideological and political fractures between parties have not allowed defining a horizon on where and how we want to go.
Doing politics means defining priorities. Perhaps it is time to think about Argentina strategically in a context where, despite the opportunities it has, it urgently needs to solidify its mesolevel between companies, universities, and the public sector.
(1) This book tries to unravel, in the light of the metaphor of “kicking the ladder” how those fully industrialized countries with a high level of economic development and human development, deny the possibility to developing countries of knowing the trajectories historical that have allowed them to consolidate themselves as powerful state actors within the international system. A common point in the trajectories of those countries was not only the protectionism of their key industries but also the monitoring, the assumption of risk and the organizational and creative capacity of the State with the private sector.
(2)The development of renewable energies and the necessary components for their deployment and implementation undoubtedly require a complex public-private articulation that seeks not only the consolidation of a sustainable pattern of extraction of global public goods (natural resources)but also a look that contemplates how a path of sustainable, inclusive and federal economic development can be delineated

North Korea’s Missile Testing During the Russia-Ukraine War,"In early 2022, theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea(DPRK) has taken every opportunity to test its weaponry by launching various types of missiles. It was reported that, besides short-range missiles, the government has tested what is thought to be its longest-range ballistic missile since 2017.While shortermissilesusually have a range of around 118 miles and a maximum altitude of 12 miles, the one sent at the end of January this year,allegedly reached the altitude of 1,242 miles and a range of 497 miles, which would be enough to hit the U.S. territory of Guam.
A few years ago, the North Korean government self-imposed a moratorium on nuclear and longer-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing, butits seventh round of weapons launching in the month of Januarymight mean the end of this suspension.
TheNon-Proliferation Treatyis a binding commitment designedto prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy besides furthering the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament. Currently, it has 191 signatories.
Despite its signing of the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1985, North Korea decided to withdraw from the NPT in 2003. Not only did the withdrawal undermine the effectiveness of the treaty, but it also proved that any member state could develop nuclear weapons if it so wished. Its continuous nuclear testing is an evident breach of major sanctions resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on North Korea. These nine resolutions were first adopted to stop the DPRK from testing.
Moreover, multilateral sanctions by the UN and unilateral ones by the United States were also imposed. However, despite the numerous resolutions drafted and the consequent sanctions, the DPRK has not ceased its nuclear activity. In fact, while states must follow the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) recommendations, the North Korean government has persisted in non-compliance.
Moreover, on February 27th, 2022, the North Korean government senta ballistic missile from near Pyongyang’s international airport toward the sea off its East Coast. In the wake of Russian President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and consequent war (read more in ourdedicated portal), which has been going on since 2014, on the 24thof February, this cannot be said to be the best move that North Korea could do in such a crucial time in history, especially when North Korea’s missile tests tend to alert its neighbors South Korea and Japan due to their nearby location.
In fact, this latest launch has been criticized by South Korea’s National Security Council which stated that“Launching a ballistic missile at a time when the world is making efforts to resolve the Ukraine war is never desirable for peace and stability in the world, the region and on the Korean Peninsula […]”. Whilea senior official in the Biden administration believes that the launching of missiles was probably done in order to test and perfect the weapons, rather than being seen as an offensive against its neighbors and the West, it can be said that North Korea might have a few reasons why it feels the need for testing its weapons.
The implications of this conduct could be many.
For example, while the Russian invasion ofUkrainecontinues, North Korea seems to be one of the few countries that supportRussia. In fact, it wasone of only five countries that voted against condemning Russia for its invasionwhen the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted for resolution A/ES-11/L.2. In this precarious time period when a nuclear threat has been made by Russia, the testing of nuclear arms with significant range by North Korea could mean potential cooperation with the Russian Federation against the USA and western powers.
It could be seeking economic aid from Russia and its allies in exchange for posing a significant threat to the populous East Coast cities of the USA and distracting American attention from the war in Ukraine with a threat that could be seen to be closer to home. The way in which the Biden administration has dismissed these missile tests and has returned its attention to Russia and the Ukraine has shown that the DPRK’s long list of previous nuclear threats may work against it in this regard. Finally, it can be said that North Korea is taking advantage of the distraction that Russia is creating in order to test the range of its nuclear missiles.
Moreover, the various tests have taken place prior toSouth Korea’s presidential election which took place in March of the current year and this might not be just a coincidence. In fact, while the Democratic Lee Jae-Myungheld summits with Kim Jong-Unin the past and had sustained diplomatic ties with the North of the Korean peninsula, analysts believe that the winner of South Korea’s election bid,Yoon Suk-Yeol, might be harsher against the northern counterpart. Since Yoon Suk-Yeol is the President-elect of South Korea, there is the possibility that the North Korean government might feel escalated pressure and threat from its neighbor. As a result, the DPRK has conducted multiple missile launches in early 2022.
Despite theDPRK’s memorandum, the DPRK has resumed its nuclear testing and it has intensified its attempts at launching a long-distance missile, one of such capacity topossibly hit the United States. The future of the DPRK’s nuclear activity has always been difficult to predict due to its isolationism and, in these uncertain times, this challenge grows greater still.
However, if the American government’s lack of urgency surrounding these tests speaks to anything, it is that for now, it has bigger fish to fry.

Burkina Faso Coup and the Sahel Militant Domino Effect,"On the 24thof January 2022, inBurkina Faso,the military seized power inthe cities of Ouagadougou, Kaya, and Ouahigouya. Armed security forces ousted President Kaboré from power, placing him under house arrest, and released a handwritten letter from him which would ultimately be his formal resignation. Despite the fact thatone of President Kaboré’s own party members attested that the letter was authentic, there are some that claim that this letter was falsified. While the phrases “military coup” and “public jubilation” may seem an odd pairing to western ears, in the capital city of Ouagadougou, hundreds took to the streets in celebration.
This coup is the most recent of many coups in the Sahel region,with both Guinea and Mali setting a precedent for Burkina Faso. This region of the world is one that has been decimated by terrorist militants fromAl-Qaedaand theIslamic State, and each attack puts further pressure on governments, which ultimately is enough to bring them down. While Burkina Faso has been relatively unstable since its bid for independence fromFrancein 1960, the terrorist attacks which started in 2015 have beenresponsible for the evacuation of 1.5 million people from the Northern and Eastern regions of the country. At least 2,000 civilians have died from terror-related attacks. Due to the constant threat, schools in much of the country have been shut down.
The main reason for the success of terrorist groups in these areas is said to be the lack of security forces and state presence. Furthermore, the lack of humanitarian aid also hampers any form of civilian resistance. The fact that theseterror attackstend to be carried out by jihadists has meant that interreligious tensions between Christians and Muslims have been rising, which in turn has made recruitment easier for the terrorist groups.
This recent coup follows public unrest over the lack of protection offered by President Kaboré’s government to the inhabitants of the Northern village of Solhan, which suffered an attack by militants in June 2021, leaving over a hundred civilians dead. Kaboré instead seemed to be more focused on the political challenge that these attacks presented, and rather than attempting to address the root of the problem to appease angry protesters, he reshuffled his cabinet, sacking the Prime Minister and naming himself the Defence Minister. Political ploys such as these, as well as refugees being unable to vote in the most recent 2020 elections, had enabled Kaboré to remain in power until the coup.
This new government has been led byPaul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, a lieutenant who has fought on the front lines against the militants. His pedigree is prestigious, having studied at a military academy in France, and earned a Master’s degree in Criminal Sciences there. Damiba installed himself as the President of the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration (MPSR) in this interim period that the new government calls a ‘transitory phase’, though the transition back to a democratically elected government has been given no established timeline by the ruling party. In his new role as the President of the MPSR, Damiba has been named the“President of Burkina Faso, head of state (and) supreme leader of the armed forces.”
The international response to this new regime has been an overwhelmingly negative one. TheAfrican Union(AU) suspended Burkina Faso from participation until such a date that civilian rule is returned to the country. Furthermore, variousUnited Nations(UN) diplomats from surrounding countries have been demanding that ex-president Kaboré be reinstated. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has also suspended Burkina Faso’s membership, but it seems far more open to collaboration with the new government in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel region. However, in its summit in Accra, the bloc did admit that the ousting of democratically elected governments needed to be stopped, as the President of Guinea-Bissau narrowly avoided death in a coup just days after the one in Burkina Faso.
Since then, the situation in Burkina Faso has hardly changed. The military government has reinstated the constitution with the aim of gaining greater international support and readmission into the AU and ECOWAS. ECOWAS has suspended and sanctioned bothMaliandGuineawith the aim of stopping the spread of antigovernmental action. Even theUnited Stateshas released a statement in support of ECOWAS, demanding the release of Kaboré.Francehas been blamed for instability, which has maintained a strong influence in West African countries since their independence. Indeed ‘Opèration Barkhane’, which has been supported by 5,100 French troops, has been called inefficient in dealing with the terrorist threat and has even been replaced by Russian mercenaries in Mali. Unfortunately, until the terrorist threat in the Sahel is brought to heel, the wave of coups in Western Africa seems unlikely to abate.

Uncle Nick: The New American Friend,"During the Second World War, theUnited Statesgovernment built an alliance with theSoviet Union(USSR) to defeat Nazism. During those days, the Kremlin was led by the ruthless dictator Iósif Vissariónovich Dzhugashvili, now famously known as Stalin. Stalin’s government was a totalitarian regime where children reported their parents to the government and the state exercised strict vigilance over citizens. However, to defeat Adolf Hitler and bring peace to Europe, the Roosevelt administration transformed cruel, cold-blooded Stalin into friendly “Uncle Joe.”
On March 8, 2022, 69 years and 3 days after Stalin’s death and 9 years and 3 days afterHugo Chavez‘s death, his heir –Nicolás Maduro– assured he was open to exporting oil to the US in order to“bring stability back to the world.”This announcement came after the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the rumors of conversations aboutlifting sanctions on PDVSA, a Venezuelan oil company, and allowing Venezuelan oil to return to the US in exchange for the recognition of the Maduro government.
With the aim of showing some goodwill,Maduro released two Americanprisoners, Gustavo Cárdenas an executive from Citgo, and Jorge Alberto Fernández, who was arrested and accused of terrorism in 2021. Without showing full compromise, the statement of the US Office of the Presidency assured that even as they celebrated the return of Cardenas and Fernandez, the US would keep fighting to bring every American who is being held against their will inVenezuela,Russia,Afghanistan,Syria,China,Iran, and elsewhere around the world.
Even though this would not be the first time that Washington supported dictatorships to assert their interests, in the XXI century of social networks, words are often recorded and YouTube acts as society’s collective memory. Democrats are losing legitimacy in the region due to, for example, the recent offensive of the Obama administration (with Biden serving as Vice President) where the US President assured Venezuela wasa threat to American security.Their aim was arguably only to justify the economic sanctions.
TheTrumpadministration took a step forward by building alliances inLatin Americaagainst Venezuela. By joining forces with presidents likeBolsonaroandMacri, Trump gave birth to the Lima Group, an alliance that was hostile to the Venezuelan regime, by recognizingJuan Guaido, and guaranteeing the votes for sanctions in the Organization of American States, and claimed for fair elections in Venezuela. At the peak of tensions, and ridicule,John Bolton’s notepad was filtered by a picture of the press where it suggested an invasion of Colombia.
The real motivation behind this sudden change in Washington is the desire to isolateRussiain every possible way and to use Venezuela’s cheap oil to try to stop the escalation in gas prices.President Bidenwould also be open to forgiving Maduro’s energic support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, orhis accusations that NATOis trying to destroy Russia. According to this reading, everything would be forgiven if Venezuela provides the oil needed to sustain the US energy market.
With this new relationship, the US is dilapidating its credibility in the regional sphere, with Nicolas Maduro recognized as the legitimate President, while continuing the erosion of human rights inNicaragua. Further,Cubain recent years supported the Venezuelan regime by building intelligence andrepressive system in their own image.
If the US continues to sacrifice their “moral legitimacy” in Latin America to embrace a dictator, then this would be the first time in history that it will have supported a socialist dictatorship since Stalin. Some of “Uncle Nick’s” crimes are so recent that they will be difficult to sustain politically, especially due to the weight the Latin vote has in states like Miami, where between400, 000 and 600, 000 Venezuelanscould potentially swing for the Republican candidate.
Beyond the moral values, the Biden administration is deeply compromising its stance on human rights, especially as a Democratic administration. The cynical alliance between Venezuela and the US resembles the picture of Donald Trump with Kim Jong Un.
Only time will tell if the revival of the business relationship between the US and the Venezuelan dictatorship will, in fact, take place. The political cost of having a Latin American “Uncle Nick” will not be cheap for Joe Biden. The human rights case against regimes like Cuba and Nicaragua will lose part of its strength and lead to a return of cynicism in the US-Latin American policy. It may even resemble the US’s Latin America strategy during the Cold War, when Castro’s human rights violations were denounced at the Organization of American States and Pinochet in Chile or Videla in Argentina were ignored.

[ANALYSIS] Deadly Greed: The Impact of Illegal Gold Mining in Peru,"Though not unique toPeru, illegal gold mining in southeastern Peru has been perniciously impacting the local environment for nearlythree decadesand the damage is increasingly far-reaching. Scientists have discovered unprecedented amounts of mercury –toxic to nearly all forms of life in large quantities– in the leaves of trees and the feathers of birds in the Amazon.
Shockingly, this problem is not just in the city of Puerto Moldonado, where the illegal gold mining actually takes place, butthroughout the Southeastern portion of the Peruvian Amazon Rainforestknown as “Madre de Dios” or Mother of God. As devastating as this news is, it does not even begin to encapsulate how extensive the damage of these illegal gold mining camps is. Issues like human trafficking, murder, and mercury poisoning in local people are just some of the ever-growing aspects of this problem.
The Origins of the Problem
The roots of illegal gold mining are economic in nature. The modern Peruvian economy relies on international trade; commodities like silver, gold, copper, fishing, agriculture, coal, and natural gas, all allowed Peru to take advantage of the 2000s commodities boom and experiencerapid economic growth. While other commodity-dependent nations have suffered from harmful oil extraction and processing, Peru’s main environmental burden has been from mining processes. As the12th largest producerof gold worldwide, there are both big corporations and illegal “entrepreneurs” looking to make a profit off of gold and other mineral resources.
Many illegal gold miners are local people trying to profit off of an economic system that prioritizes city dwellers and often leaves rural communities behind. Often, though not exclusively, these aretradesmen who sell agricultural productsand turn to gold mining in times of economic hardship. These communities often do not have access to basic amenities, good education, or job opportunities. In recent years,Andean peoplehave started migrating to this region for a chance to make money as well.
Mercury and its Environmental Impact
The type of mining happening in the Madre de Dios region is called “artisanal and small-scale gold mining” which is almost always done illegally and isthe largest source of mercury pollution in the world.
Mercury binds to goldwhich separates it from river sediments. After separation, the mercury is burned off in an open fire oven and the smoke carries it into the air. These air particles then become embedded in leaf tissues after making contact with the ground through rainfall and being absorbed by trees. In some ways, the way the Amazonian trees absorb mercury is good for the local environment. Capturing mercury is, in a way, like sequestering carbon, and it is much better for the mercury to be kept out of the aquatic system where it turns into methylmercury, an extremely poisonous bioaccumulative environmental toxicant. However, if the trees were to be cut down or burnt, the captured mercury would be released into the environment and cause even more damage.
Mercury is far more likely to transform into methylmercury in the Amazon than anywhere else because of the sheer quantity that has been put into the environment combined with the wet floor bed of the forest. Moreover, in some parts of this region, there’s been a670% increase in land areas covered by abandoned mining pitswhere the low-oxygen conditions of these mining pits accelerate the transformation of mercury into methylmercury. The impact on the flora and fauna is devastating and could potentially result in areduction in the reproduction ratesof Amazonian birds and birth defects in larger mammals who consume the poisoned water.
The mercury that is poisoning the trees and birds is also poisoning the humans who live in the region. Some of the potential health risks of mercury poisoning include tremors, muscle weakness, vision and hearing impairments, and loss of coordination and balance. In severe cases, it can cause birth defects or death. Gold miners themselves are, of course, at exceptionallyhigh riskfor contracting severe cases of mercury poisoning.
Human Trafficking and Murder
Mining endeavors in Puerto Maldonado, where most of the illegal activity in the Madre de Dios region takes place, have become increasingly secretive and complex since its inception. Since 2008, the exuberant rise in gold prices has attracted criminal organizations who get involved andexploit the local miners through extortion. When the governmentdeclared a State of Emergency in 2019and began using military force to arrest illegal miners, the groups became evenmore violent and organizedand began featuring more illegal activity than just mining.
The process behind implementing the State of Emergency has proven ineffective. By the time the military operation shows up, miners have often already moved deeper into the rainforest. The groups frequently change locations to avoid authorities often leaving behind waste and machinery in favor of avoiding legal repercussions. However, these “pop-up” mining sites are not as simple as one might imagine. Mirroring small villages, these mining sites are always accompanied by“prostibars”, which are usually full of underaged girls who have been trafficked. The biggest example is La Pampa, located outside Puerto Maldonado. This area is one of the poorest in Peru and, uncoincidentally, is one of the most affected by human trafficking.
Sadly, younger girls are particularly sought after as having sex with a virgin isthought to bring good luckto the miners’ endeavors. Some of these girls, as young as 13, aretricked by friends or fake advertsthat they could make extra money as a nanny or restaurant workers. Some are migrants, passing through the area looking for employment, with illegal options being most accessible to them. Regardless of how they got there, these girls and women are violently exploited and struggle to escape the horrors of the camps.
The Impact of Covid
Unsurprisingly, thepandemicmade this bad situation even worse, attracting Peruvians who might otherwise never consider this type of work. Before the Pandemic, Carlos* was a tour guide in Cusco. When Covid caused the near elimination of the tourism sector, Carlos found himself in a difficult financial situation and in need of work. He knew that one of his family members had been working in the rainforest for years and had become extremely wealthy from it, joining what is known asan elite class of small-scale gold mining entrepreneurs. Carlos spent a month with him in 2020 to learn more about his work.
What he found was shocking and heartbreaking. As a faithful follower of Pachamama (the Andean tradition of worshipping Mother Earth), Carlos couldn’t ethically commit to work that was actively killing the Earth around him. Witnessing not just the environmental devastation, but learning about the physical dangers of operating the machinery and the potential risk that a team member would turn on you, forced him back to Cusco where he found other, less lucrative ways to get by until tourism began to slowly reemerge in late 2021.
Carlos’s relative is an example of non-native workers living in and profiting off of the Madre de Dios region. As mentioned, not all of the miners are locals and many of them are Peruvians from other parts of the country, like the Andean highlands, looking for lucrative opportunities. Those who join the“elite” of the mining communitywill do anything it takes to preserve their way of life and have even been able to mobilize nationalistic political movements to “defend” Peruvian rights to mine over big, foreign corporations.
The situation has become so heated that even just mentioning illegal gold mining in Puerto Moldonado could be enough to put your life in danger, Romeo* – a local whose relative also has experience in this region – told TNGO. The risks can impact everyone from a random passerby who asks the wrong question to a human rights defender likeRoberto Carlos Pachecowho was shot dead in 2020 by an unknown aggressor for his activism against illegal mining. In 2020 alone,four indigenous leaders were murderedin the Madre de Dios region for outwardly opposing illegal mining, logging, and trafficking on their lands. With the pandemic at the forefront of conversion nationally, these murders went relatively unacknowledged and the authorities did little in response.
Pachamama, Environmentalism, and Indigenous Communities
The practice of worshipping Pachamama is alive and well in Peru, especially in Andean communities. In theAmazonregions, Pachamama is not as prevalent because this area was never part of the Incan Empire that historically practiced it, but many forms of ancient spirituality have been preserved by indigenous communities, and reverence for the Earth is deeply tied to their ways of life.
All around the world, native communities have been able to find a voice politically alongside the environmental movement and have been using their spirituality as an argument against corporate endeavors. Think ofIndia giving Rivers legal rightsor Native Americansstopping the construction of the Keystone Pipeline in the US. In nearby neighboring Bolivia, environmentalism, justified through “Pachamamaism” was utilized byindigenous politiciansrunning for office.
In Peru, a good example of a successful cross-over between political movements and environmentalism is the case of mining near Montana de Siete Colores or Rainbow Mountain. A World Heritage Site located in the Ausangate mountains, this unique, biologically, and minerally rich region of Peru is surrounded bysnowy mountains and glaciers that locals have watched meltover the course of their lives. In 2015, The Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute (INGEMMET)authorized the request of mining companyMinquest Perú S.A.C (owned by the Canadian company Camino Minerals Corporation) to exploit the entire valley including conservation areas, Rainbow Mountain itself, and land owned by the Chillihuani and Pampachiri communities.
Thanks to the investigative work ofCooperAccion, a Peruvian non-profit civil association, which promotes the knowledge and exercise of social, environmental, political, cultural, and economic rights as well as the sustainable management of the territory with gender and intercultural approaches, this plan was thwarted through civil actions. The local people’scivic actions and pressure on the governmentare what ultimately stopped these ambitions. Some of the locals went as far as to travel to Lima in order to protest the mining of their land, a tour guide in the area mentioned to me.
The preservation of Rainbow Mountains demonstrates two key points. First, when land is owned by indigenous people and they are able to profit off of tourism directly, an endeavor likeillegal gold mining becomes less appealingdue to its dangerous nature. While tourism presents its own environmental risks, giving back to the local communities minimizes the risk of other problems developing alongside the environmental destruction, as is seen in the Amazon. Second, native communities which do play an active role in protecting the environment and can gain domestic or even international recognition are proven to be powerful. While locals are involved in the exploitation of the Amazon, most indigenous communities are against it and, as mentioned, the situation is primarily being exploited by criminal organizations and non-native “elite entrepreneurs”. By empowering indigenous communities and recognizing their land rights, there is a way out of the exploitative practices of artisanal small-scale gold mining.
The Path Forward
While the devastation of illegal gold mining is multi-faceted and complex, there are plenty of organizations doing amazing work towards stopping it.
In 2021,NASA and USAIDbegan combating illegal mining alongside the Peruvian government by using satellite images to track the mining activities. The initiative provides near-real-time images and empowered locals to be able to prevent destruction by allowing for the groups to be tracked more efficiently and more safely than doing so on the ground.
Amazon Aid is also doing its part throughmany different initiativesincluding theCleaner Gold Networkwhich brings together consumers, scientists, artists, educators, indigenous communities, NGOs, and companies from the gold sector. The aim of this network is to connect actors who can discover and promote solutions to illegal gold mining.
Finally,The Artisinal Mining Challengeis driving innovative solutions by distributing $1,000,000+ in prizes to accelerate solutions to conserve the Amazon, protect communities, and transform artisanal and small-scale gold mining in the rainforest.
Permanent damage has already been done to the people, wildlife, and natural environment of the Peruvian Amazon. Without big, drastic changes, Peru and the world risk the loss of one of the most spectacular places on Earth.

Ecuador Prison Riots: How Did We Get Here?,"As a result of a string of gang-linked riots, more than 300 people were killed inside Ecuadorian prisons in 2021. The deadliest one on record took place in September when 119 people – all inmates – died at Penitenciaria del Litoral in Guayaquil.
Violence is a common denominator in prisons, especially inLatin America, where overcrowding remains a ruling factor.According to the University of London Institute for Crime and Justice Policy Research (ICPR), the region has one of the highest prison occupancy levels. At an average of 163%, for every available unit, there are 1.6 inmates. In this situation, it is not uncommon for guards to patrol the exterior of facilities, while inmates are in charge of everyday life.
Overcrowding in Latin American prisons is, for the most part, a consequence of mass incarceration policies. Governments across the region struggle with citizens’ demands regarding insecurity in the streets; prioritizing arrests over prosecutions is a quick fix to this issue. This results in prisons harboring not only convicted criminals, but people awaiting trial – a process that, it is worth emphasizing, can take years. As a result of overcrowding, living conditions become unbearable, with poor quality food, lack of clear water, and overall unsanitary surroundings as common denominators. Prison security also deteriorates for thelack of funding, leaving officials outnumbered by prisoners. It is inevitable to think that in such situations, revolts become more plausible.
“Ten countries in Latin America are operating prison systems at more than 200% capacity“
In this context, gang rivalry plays an important role. Historically, narcos-led gangs thrive in prisons – such as the gangs of Pablo Escobar or El Chapo Guzmán. However, nowadays, they are not only operating on a national level but at aninternationalone as well – a trend that has been increasing over the last decade.
As stated above, poor conditions play a significant role in the riots.However, there are otherreasons why revolts took place inEcuadorand not in other countries in the region.Firstly, its shared borders withColombia(the world’s largest cocaine producer). Colombian policy against drug trafficking has been one of zero tolerance after the renowned “war on drugs” (a policy implemented, and led by, the United States with the aim of reducing drug trafficking globally and, therefore, in the U.S; overseas usually involves military aid) that, among other things, led to the persecution and assassination of Pablo Escobar and the consequent dissolution of the Medellin Cartel. Therefore, Ecuador ends up being a nexus between international cartels and Colombian coca plantations. Secondly, as mentioned before, because of its geographic position (located in the center of the continent), Ecuador can be considered agateway to smuggle drugsfrom North to South America – and vice versa.
This scenario led Ecuador to a new wave ofviolencein the streets as well as in the prisons.According to Mario Pazmiño, former Chief of the Ecuadorian Army’s intelligence unit, “one trend over the last ten years is the increased presence of Mexican cartels in Ecuador, who hire and arm with local gangs to protect their drug corridors”. Similar to what takes place in Mexico, competing cartels are waging an all-out war against the state and each other.
Right after the riots,President Lassodecreed a national State of Emergency, imposing a curfew and allowing military forces to patrol the streets. The same military forces were later ordered to assist with prison security – which is still in place today. In addition, the head of the country’s prison authority announced thatas many as 2,000 prisoners would be pardonedin an attempt to reduce overcrowding in its detention centers.
President Lasso seems to belooking for international assistance in security matters. In May 2022 he traveled toIsraeland along with President Herzog signed amemorandumto expand bilateral cooperation in security, innovation, and trade. On May 14th, astatementwas issued by the Commission for Penitentiary Dialogue and Pacification in which organized crime groups in Ecuador expressed their willingness to initiate apacification processin the prisons. The statement included signings from groups such as Los Lobos, Latin Kings, Los Tiguerones and Chonekillers. The Commission also stated that the national government was working on accelerating the professionalization of penitentiary security and surveillance corps.
A month later, it wasannouncedthat the national prison service would incorporate a hundred officials to reduce overcrowding. Psychologists, lawyers, and social workers are included in these numbers, which showcase a renewed interest to tackle the ongoing situation regarding prisons with an interdisciplinary approach.
As stated, the Ecuadorian administration is taking action and working toward reverting the situation. Nonetheless, it seems that there isno intention to develop a long-term policy to reform the prison system. In this regard, privatization of prisons around the country should be considered as a way to eradicate corruption practices. It is clear that it will take time to root out decades of bad practices.
Unfortunately, the events that took place in Ecuador do not seem like they will come to an end in the near future, but they can serve as a lesson. Especially in Latin America, governments should not be surprised by the state of violence related to the prison system, where regional insecurity mostly comes from this type of criminal network and the living conditions of inmates are way below average.

Climate Change effect on Africa’s Agriculture,"Climate change, increasing sea levels, increased temperature, and extreme weather have become a threat toAfrica‘s human health and safety, food, and water security as well as the socio-economic development of the continent. As a matter of fact, the IPCCidentifiesAfrica as the most vulnerable continent when coming to climate change.
Agricultureis an important part of the economic growth in Africa, and the effects of climate change can generate significant instability in economic growth via the alteration of agricultural economies. This article aims to further dive into how climate change affects African nations and poses a challenge as well as looking at the way forward in dealing with this issue of climate change in Africa throughadaptation.
“Agriculture is the backbone of Africa’s economy and accounts for the majority of livelihoods across the continent.”
Agriculture in Africa faces a huge risk. There has become reduced crop productivity as a consequence of repeated droughts and above-standard heat. According toNASA: Global Climate Change, climate change may affect the production of maize (corn) and wheat as early as from 2030 under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The crop yields of maize are expected to decline by 24%, while wheat is expected to grow by 17%.
Furthermore, the increased pest damage, floods, and disease-related damage all impact the food system infrastructure – an impact that thenresultsin huge food security issues, on livelihoods, stretching from individual households to the national level.According to theState of Climate in Africa, the level of risk has been identified as “very high” if the global mean temperature increases by 2°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2080-2100.
The Sahel, a region in Africa separating the Sahara Desert to the north and tropical savannas to the south,is mainly dependent on rain-fed agriculture. This region regularly experiences many droughts and floods, and this results in negative consequences to people’s food security.
“Drought, desertification and scarcity of resources have led to heightened conflicts”
Conflictsare seen between farmers and cattle herders. The reasons for these conflicts are that often cattle farmers find themselves having to migrate due to the scarcity of resources and the burning vegetation. The obvious, yet dramatic, results of this process are conflicts with the crop farmers in the areas they migrate to. Drying grazing lands mean cattle herders in the countryare forced to migrateonto arable farmland, often putting them at loggerheads with crop farmers.
The impact ofclimate changedoes not only affect food security and agriculture, but it also has a direct impact on the seen hike infood prices, which is a policy area that tends to be often side-lined. The recent increase in food prices in Africa has caused hardship to poor and vulnerable people in the world, but sub-Saharan Africa has been seen to bethe most affected. Themain causeof the price increase in Africa has beenoutdated farming practices,poor facilities, suboptimal power generation capacity, and lack of water storage and irrigation capacity. These have limited the development of agriculture, endangered food security, and delayed agricultural-based products.
The developing region of Sub-Saharan Africa displays a threefold – ecological, cultural, and climatic – diversity.A2009 UNECA reportindicates that Africans economically depend on income that is primarily derived from agriculture and fisheries. As a result, climatic change puts indeed a significant strain on the continent.
According to theEconomic Report on Africa 2009, agriculture is an extremely important sector in the African continent, on average accounting for 70% of the labor force and over 25% of the GDP. The main reason why Africa is the continent that is affected by climate change the most is its geographical characteristics that have the land lying across the warming tropics as well as thelimited knowledge within the social and economic spectrums that need African countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
As the Fifth IPCC Assessment Report indicates, demographic and economic trends in Africa mean thatclimate impacts will be intensified. This means that the growing populations will increase their demand for water and food – but in effect, the prolonged extreme conditions such as droughts will put more pressure on the scarcity of water resources that were already in place and that will decrease the crop yields.
“It is important to recognise that, even if global society ceased to emit greenhouse gasses today, further warming is inevitable in the next few decades.”
What is seen to be the solution or rather the better option at the moment for Africa is toadapt. This can be achieved through policymakers in agriculture and the environment joining forces with civil society and non-governmental organizations to find ways to adapt existing infrastructure to the impacts – both the inevitable and likely ones – of climate change. According to the Synthesis ReportClimate Change 2014, through the process of adaptation, societies will be able to find ways to moderate the effects and the harm that comes with climate change while simultaneously trying to take advantage of the new opportunities that may come. Adaptation may not only bring aid now but could also bring aid to what is the future of Africa.
Adaptationcan indeed contributeto the well-being of populations, the security of assets, and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions, and services now and in the future. It needs to be noted, however, that adaptation is bothcontext-specificandlocation-specific. Even with significant resources and institutional investment in adaptation for the most vulnerable,there may be residual risksto food security, access to water, health, and human security.
The adaptation of the ecosystem is another way to help Africa deal with climate change. This strategy entails mitigating the climate change impact by using natural systems like drought-resistant varieties, more diversity in crop rotation as well as more efficient methods of water storage. In Zambia,61% of farmers who applied an ecosystem-based adaptation, such as natural resource conservation or sustainable organic agricultural practices, reported surplus yields.
Another way that can be used isprotecting watershedsand reinforcing the capacity they have in order to hold water. This will then be carried to those who need it most using integrated pest management, which is a natural and cost-effective way of protecting crops that use intercropping, crop rotation, and agroforestry. These different methodologies bring nutrient diversity to the fields while ensuring the improvement of production yields is continuous and performed in a natural way.Maintaining forestsandusing forest foodsusing natural fertilizers like manure and using natural pollinators like bees, which, according to a recent study, could further increase fruit yields by 5%. As an added benefit, these alternatives are significantly cost-effective,reports indicate.
Climate change does not have to necessarily and solely bring food insecurity in Africa. It rather is bringing a unique stimulus to build resilience within African communities that could enable them to stimulate their existing ecosystems and available natural resource bases in the long run. The situation that Africa finds itself in when coming to climate change can potentially build good practices and manage the unavoidable effects of climate change.

The Subnational Channels of Latin America’s Integration: An Opportunity to Go Beyond National Linkages,"The last meeting for the 30th anniversary ofMercosurhas exemplified the responses of the presidents ofUruguayandArgentina, specifically calling Argentina a ballast for the regional integration bloc, which reflects the abrupt changes within the international political economy and the adjustments in the export profiles of many countries.
There are multiple plausible explanations for why the National Uruguay Government said what it said, but it is also very important to abstract ourselves from the conjectural and move to a much more structural and historical plane that allows us to identify what changes have occurred within South America as well as its relationship with the world. For this reason, this article seeks to explore, in a context of growing internal tensions in each country and therefore of an increasingly rigid and less pragmatic relationship between countries, the possibility of thinking of another form of relationship that goes beyond state-centrism and begins to analyze a new political economy between the provinces of the different National States.
Since the End of the Cold War, theglobalizationprocess has experimented with an extraordinary change in how the global economy is organized today.  There have been considerable structural changes in relation to a strong expansion of the agenda and non-state actors, as well as a growing multidimensional interdependence that has strong economic and political consequences. In fact, the current international system and the main international dynamics have gradually increased its complexity and disorder in the face of the existence of multiple agendas, actors and global alliances, processes of (inter)regional and global integration, as well as the economic-political consequences of the present vertiginous process of change.
In this manner, globalization does not “pre-establish[] a hierarchy between the actors of international policy and emphasis great attention to the role of the extended variety of non-state actors“ (Legler 2005, 255). This would be useful to rethink how the private sector, non-governmental organizations, philanthropic organizations, provincial and municipal actors, social organizations, unions, and global movements interact among them.
Within Latin America, this global process and the resulting opportunities and challenges should be carefully analyzed. Nowadays there are different political systems and dynamics that are critical to understanding its function in light of new forms ofinteractionsbetween countries, provinces, and non-state actors. For example, Argentina and Brazil both have a federal system whose main character is the decentralization and political capital to take important decisions in health, education, and economic spheres. As a result, the political-economic dynamic is more complicated and different than in unitary countries such as Chile and Uruguay.
This dynamic generates theproliferation of multiple actors(provinces, local political actors, and specific strategical regions with important economic horizons)with concrete political goals. The multiplication of subnational, national, and global actors reflects the multilevel governance where the National-State is not a monolithic and unique actor. In the short term, within each state, there is a complex range of actors that constantly push for their local and foreign public policy interests. The Nation States do not have a univocal national interest, but each foreign policy project is dared by a set of resistances and power relations that are important to analyze and identify at the same time what margins of maneuver can be achieved in order to improve the results of the Latin American integration processes.
The entrance of the 21st century has entailed adeep reconfiguration of the traditional economic alliancesand patterns that offer constant political pendulums to different national ways of “doing politics.” If we want to understand the internal tensions within the MERCOSUR bloc, as well as the instances of dialogue that exceed the bloc but that are an important and structuring part of Latin American political-diplomatic relations, it is central to observe that there areimportant changes in the global economic structuregiven the change in the profiles exporters of the countries of the region. The rising ofChinaand its presence in critical and strategic sectors (Infrastructure and energy sector), but also its growing demand for our export basket, means that there is a significant shift in the preferences of decision-makers towards China and Southwest Asia. According to theObservatory of Economic Complexity,
if we took the most relevant economiesin the region– Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay –  the increase in the relative weight of Chinese exports and imports is unbelievable.
A second consequence, in light of the national political will to redefine the international insertion profiles of the regional blocs, for example, MERCOSUR, is therevisionist position of many of the national decision-makers. Change and evolution are two key characteristics that any regional integration process must have if the latter is to last over time. However, political/bureaucratic rigidity, as well as political inaction, consolidate a political climate that promotes regional disintegration.
In fact, during the last twenty years,  it has been aproliferation and overlap of formal multilateral blocs(MERCOSUR, CELAC, Pacific Alliance,  ONASUR) and informal forums and mechanisms of political discussion(ALBA, PRO SUR, PARLASUR, LIMA GROUP, etc.)that seeks to overcome these problems. The immediate result was even more inflation of instances of dialogue but without dialogue or political will and the difficulty to build state policies that transcend electoral political cycles. In international terms,  these tensions rise the asymmetry between great and middle state powers.
As a result of this doubled process,Latin Americafaces severe problems with national political coordination. However, South-South cooperation is possible if we go on the basis of subnational and micro-level negotiations and understanding of common interest than grandiloquent and national negotiations in a context of political tension between national authorities.
The purpose of this analysis is exploratory due to it seeks to identify strategic and economic spaces of regional-multilevel public politics to overcome country-country tensions and generate positive synergies.
The current international system is strongly debating thenecessary pathsthat need to be taken to undertakesocially, economically, and environmentally sustainable growth paths. NowadaysLatin Americahas a critical window of opportunity to join thenew global green value chainsthat will begin to emerge. For example, inArgentina, the subnational states (provinces) have strong connections with important multinational corporations and nation-states and there are attempts to design some national-locals alliances with specific goals such as it is the green transition and the potential of renewable energies (INVAP, CENNIA, Consortium for the Development of the Hydrogen Economy in Argentina – H2ar).The South-South Cooperation should be understood as a regional policy that complements the current existing north-south policies, but which makes it possible to create certain enclaves of regional autonomy so that later it will have a greater weight in negotiation.
This local initiative could have anencouraging political and economic roadmapwith other countries, likeBrazil‘s provinces with satellite, nuclear, and solar common public policies. Sao Pablo, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande Do Sul have common exports and imports profiles to cooperate and create innovations in automobile and infrastructure agenda or the green agri-economic solutions.
This possibility to build a horizon is very probable withChileandBolivia, both with important lithium reserves like Argentina. As a result, Jujuy, Catamarca, and Salta should have more connections with Antofagasta and Potosi to build a trilateral lithium alliance and rethink the window of opportunity. In a context with enormous economic, social, and political restrictions, the political and economic elites should identify strategically how globalization impacts the emergency of new actors and strategic regions at the same time to observe what roadmaps can bring positive synergies in the future.

Native Boarding Schools: The Other Side of the New World,"Oscar Handlin, American Historian and Professor at Harvard once said, “Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants were American history.” This statement could be considered a piece of general knowledge, however, we often forget to identify the side effects of such well-known facts. Ever since Christopher Columbus reachedthe American continentin 1492, and it became known to the western world, it attracted waves of colonizers and immigrants. Oftentimes these immigrants were young men with nothing to lose who wanted to make a life of their own in a land that promised adventure and unparalleled opportunities. Others came from aristocratic families and saw a profitable investment in the new raw materials and resources.
This part of history has been ingrained in a whole generation that grew up watchingWild Westmovies and dressing up as cowboys. However, it is not often that we stop and wonder about the other side of the story. What happened to the people who were already there? What happened to the Indigenous populations? In the Eurocentric vision that has branded history ever since it blossomed as an academic discipline in the 19thcentury, the First Nations were merely minor characters, if at all mentioned.
In recent years there has beena new vision of historyunfolding, a new way of telling the story that aims to make it more accurate by narrating not from the perspective of the winners, but of those who lost. The Indigenous community (a broad and heterogenic term) is raising its voice, which has been neglected since the very beginning. An era of cultural reappropriation and open celebration of native origins and traditions is emerging.
However, with this new understanding of generational trauma comes the unraveling of certain truths. One of the most recently discovered ones was related toNative Boarding Schools. In 1819 the US Congress passed The Civilization Fund Act, which, as its name may point out, was an initiative aimed at “taming” the wilderness of these peoples, or “civilizing” them. The urge to control not only the native population but their future (via their descendants) was motivated by two main issues. The first reason was the racist system on which the soon-to-beUSAwould rely in order to get much of its puissance, and the second was a need for land. During the early and mid 19thcentury, the colonial population was rapidly increasing and the east coast, all the way down to what we now know as Louisiana, was becoming densely populated by newcomers.
This drove many explorers to “conquer the Wild West” which led to the Indigenous peoples being persecuted, enslaved, and ostracized in reservations with little to no access to water or fertile land. Despite these hardships, Native Americans were resilient; they were not willing to give up their land, culture, and identity altogether. Boarding schools were seen as an effective way to ensure future generations were more acquainted with the colonial ways than with their own roots.Roughly 360 schools were scattered over the country, becoming the “home” of around 60,000 Indigenous kids between 1860 and 1978 mainly.
By 1891 in virtue of the permission given by Congress, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs made it compulsory for Indigenous children to attend boarding schools. This measure had to be installed after encountering various forms of resistance from the First Nations, who impeded their children from being taken, sometimes encouraging them to run away. Due to the harsh conditions that the Indigenous peoples were forced to live in, some of them eventually accepted the imposed legislation and sent their kids to boarding schools, as many of them did not have another way to ensure their future.
Testimonialsshow that one of the first things done to the Indigenous children who arrived in one of these schools was stripping them of their traditional dresses, names, and hair. Instead, they were given clothes that matched the colonial fashion, an Anglo-Saxon name, and a drastic haircut. It is important to stress the importance that hair held and still holds for Indigenous peoples; it is not just a way of showing pride for belonging to their culture, but also a sign of respect towards their ancestors. Other expressions of their origins such as their language, music, and dances were also forbidden. When native children arrived at boarding schools, the adults overseeing them were instructed to “kill the Indian and save the man.”
This phenomenon extended, not just over what we now know as the USA but also toCanadawhere in the summer of 2021almost 1000 unmarked graveswere found in two of their boarding schools. These discoveries were fruitful thanks to the combined efforts of the Government of Canada and several Indigenous associations that were pushing for a reconciliation program. The latter involved conducting research to find 10,000 to 25,000 children who perished in Canada in these schools. Reports state that some of these graves belonged to children as young as 3 years old. Between 1870 and 1997 (when the last of these boarding schools closed) an estimated 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families.
The final report on these findings will be released this spring and the Indigenous community has shown the relevance and significance this will hold moving forward through various social media posts and events. What remains a mere page in a history book in western colonial culture, signifies a loss for those on the other side of it. To this day, survivors of these boarding schools testify to the brutal treatment they received as children just for being on one side of history.","June 20, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/native-boarding-schools-the-other-side-of-the-new-world/,Silvia Zarzuela Martin,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"Many Critics, a Few Allies, and Some Awkward Friends: Mapping and Explaining Latin American Reactions to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine","On 21 February 2022, Russian PresidentVladimir Putinrecognizedthe regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in easternUkraineas independent states. Two days later he ordered alarge-scale invasion of Ukrainian soil. The move, labeled by the Kremlin as a “special military operation”, was allegedly designed to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine. InEuropeandNorth America, the invasion met harshcriticismand led to the imposition of severesanctionsby many governments. Elsewhere, however, reactions were not as unified.
Latin Americais a geographically distant and mostly relatively detached region vis-a-visRussia, politically and economically. Although there has been a relatively recent renewed interest from Moscow in the region, by and large, Moscow still holds little leverage for cajoling governments in the region to support its military adventures. Therecent invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, reinforces this perception. Despite the exception of a few unsurprisingly friendly words from allied governments and some ambiguous reactions from regional sympathizers, Moscow’s actions were met withwidespread condemnation in Latin America. Illustrative of this, on March 2, 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution ES-11/1, which condemned Russia’s military actions and reaffirmed the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, with all but four Latin American countries voting in favor of the draft.
Latin American governments, by a large majority, criticized Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. Collectively, they voted in favor of resolutions condemning the invasion not only in the UN but also in the Organization of American States, where a US-sponsored draft was approved on March 25, 2022, with 28 votes for, zero votes against, and five abstentions. Among the five abstentions, two countries that had already abstained during the UN vote (BoliviaandEl Salvador) and three countries that had voted in favor of the UN resolution (Brazil,Honduras, and Saint Vicent and the Grenadines). Individually, many countries were extremely vocal in their criticism. For instance, Colombian PresidentIvan Duquelabeled Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a threat to world peace, while Chilesupportedinternational sanctions on Russia andwithdrewan invitation for Russian companies to participate in a defense-related event in Santiago.
Colombia rechaza categóricamente el ataque premeditado e injustificado que se ha perpetrado contra el pueblo ucraniano por parte de Rusia, que no solo atenta contra su soberanía sino amenaza a la paz mundial.pic.twitter.com/1IbJcPsIiR
Rusia ha optado por la guerra como medio para resolver conflictos. Desde Chile condenamos la invasión a Ucrania, la violación de su soberanía y el uso ilegitimo de la fuerza. Nuestra solidaridad estará con las víctimas y nuestros humildes esfuerzos con la paz.
Furthermore, Latin American leaders from Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguaysigneda joint letter denouncing the invasion.
These reactions are very much in line with two values deeply entrenched in the Latin American political tradition: sovereignty and peaceful settlement of disputes.The former value exists because of the collective struggle against colonial powers (Legler, 2013). The latter proves why, between 1816 and 2007,  only 8 out of 227 wars worldwide were fought in Latin America (Franchi, 2017).
In contrast to its critics, Russia has received vocal and adamant support from its three main allies in the region:Venezuela,Cuba, andNicaragua. The trio was quick toportrayRussia’s incursion as nothing more than a rational and warranted reaction to allegedly invasive and hostile actions ofNATOand the U.S.
Of course, support from these countries came as a surprise to no one, considering that they have had close ties with Russia. Moscow has been committed not only to the development of closer ties with Caracas, Havana, and Managua but to the ultimate survival of these regimes.
InVenezuelaandCuba, Russia is a promoter of stability both through the deployment of military forces and diplomatic support. For instance, as recently as 2019, Russiasenttroops to Venezuela to help control unrest against Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. It alsosold36 Russian fighter jets for $10 billion and injected $1.1 billion in oil field investment from Russian companies. In Cuba, Russia emphaticallyadvocatedin favor of the Cuban Communist Party’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, when the party came under attack from protests erupting over shortages of food and medicine in July 2021. Regarding Nicaragua, Russia maintains strong diplomatic support for President Daniel Ortega’shandlingof political opposition.
Lastly, there were at least three countries where reactions to the Ukrainian conflict were mixed, or at least, ambiguous: Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia.
In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has maintained neutrality. During a press conference, hestated, “we are not going to take sides. We are going to continue to be neutral and help however possible to find a solution”. He noted Brazil’s ties to Russian oil and fertilizers. “Peace is the best option to avoid price spikes,” he said. However, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry, especially through its mission to the UN, has proffered a tougher position against Russia. On February 24, the Ministryexpressedits “grave concern for the outbreak of military operations by the Russian Federation against targets in the territory of Ukraine”.
In Argentina, President Alberto Fernandez, in a meeting with Putin three weeks before the start of the conflict,offeredArgentina as a “point of entry” for Russian engagement with Latin America. Fernandez was very hesitant to condemn Russia, leading both opposition lawmakers and the Ukrainian Embassy in Buenos Aires tocallon Fernández to take a stronger stance against Moscow. After weeks of pressure, heconcededand decided to call out the invasion.
Lastly, in Bolivia, President Luis Arce also came under heavycriticismfor the fact that his country was the only one in the region, besides the three aforementioned Russian allies, to abstain during the UN General Assembly vote to condemn Russia.
After decades of a meteoric rise in Soviet influence in Latin America during the Cold War, the collapse of the USSR brought a much moredistantrelationship between the Kremlin and many governments in the region.
Embroiled with enough domestic problems, 1990’s Russia had torenege much of its political and economic support to its alliesin an otherwise strong sphere of American influence. For instance, after years of staunch support for the left-wing Sandinista government, inNicaragua, Moscow refused to commit much funding for the campaign of Sandinista Daniel Ortega ahead of the 1990 Nicaraguan general elections. After Ortega lost to oppositionist Violeta Chamorro, the Kremlin swiftly recognized the results of the elections and called for a peaceful transition. Likewise, Moscow drastically cut its economic assistance to Havana and in 1991 announced the withdrawal of its military brigade from Cuba.
But after years of dwindling influence, or even neglect, towards LATAM, Russia started making a comeback to the region, both economically and politically, especially during the 2010s. In the economic area, Russia has successfully pursued new commercial opportunities in Latin America. Despite Russia’s sluggish economic growth, its commercial presence in Latin America has expanded: from 2006 to 2016, Russia’s trade with Latin America increased by 44% to $12 billion, and approximately half of Moscow’s trade deals were concentrated in Brazil and Mexico. In the political arena, Russia has advanced a sovereignty-focused normative agenda that appeals to countries throughout the region. Particularly, the country has been a strident supporter of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela governments, underscoring its great power aspirations in the region.
Russia’s resurgence in Latin America has also beenthwarted by a considerable soft power deficit. A February 2020 Pew Research Survey revealed that confidence in Vladimir Putin’s leadership stood at just 34% in Brazil, 36% in Argentina, and 39% in Mexico. A 2017 Pew Research Survey similarly revealed that favorable perceptions of Russia range from 27% in Argentina to 41% in Peru. This soft power deficit can be explained by the overhang of Cold War-era anti-communist sentiments and the unpopularity of Putin’s governance model. The coronavirus pandemic gave Russia an opportunity to reverse this trend, but Moscow’s Sputnik V deliveries in Latin America have fallen short of expectations. Guatemala’s cancellation of Sputnik V imports on July 28th, which was triggered by Russia’s delivery of just 550,000 doses instead of the 8 million promised, is emblematic of the failure of Moscow’s vaccine diplomacy in Latin America.

Queering Conflict Transformation and Peace-building,"Thereportreleased by Human Rights Watch in March this year elaborates on the impunity of violence of armed groups against theLGBTQpopulation inIraq. The torture, abduction, killings, and sexual violence against the LGBTQ population in Iraq prompts a reexamination of the degree of gender inclusivity in international conventions and humanitarian laws.
LGBTQ refugees oncedisplaced from Syria were harassed in Lebanonin 2014, targeted as threats to ‘security’, and assaulting LGBTQ refugees inKenyameant setting their shelters on fire.  The violence against the queer population has always been omnipresent. Nonetheless, the coverage and inclusion of the community in conflict zones have expanded over a span of just three decades.
Although the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has formally recognized the family life of the LGBTQ population and the rights of LGBTQ families under armed conflict and displacement,there remains a substantially disgregated outlook. The broad generalization ofqueerimplies the difficulty in defining the intersubjectivity of self-construction. Performativity of gender roles as elucidated by Judith Butler and Michel Foucault questions normalized notions of expressing sexuality. Tiina Rosenberg emphasizes that the ‘queer’ can connote a wide variety of meanings. The ‘queer turn’ in International Relations believes thatqueeringis a broader and all-encompassing vantage point than solely LGBT.  Thewestern centrism of the term LGBTis partially remedied by the Q in LGBTQ as it broadens the scope for those struggling with gender dysphoria.
Nonetheless, we must not forget thatthe Indigenous, localized versions of nomenclature, although representative,have mostly been used inpejorativesenses. This domain continues to be contentious and an argument can be made that it ought to be left to the queer community what they want to be referred by.
It can be extrapolated that the term ‘LGBTQ’ has urbanized shades to it and finds meager recognition in rural spatialities of the Global South.Yvette Tayloremphasizes the ease with which urban, well-settled queer may find relatively lesser impediments than the queer enmeshed in structural class violence and displacement. Understandably,class and queerness cannot mutually ignore each other. Thegender-sensitiveColombian Peace Agreementof 2016encompasses the entirety of the gender spectrum. It covers the masculinity that seeks to reconcile and demobilize in a post-conflict setting and the dangers of getting re-armed due to poor reintegration. Extensive and internationally gathered evidence shows once and again that anti-homosexual violence persists beyond wartime in peace settings as well.
Jamie J. Hagen, asserts that the visibility of the LGBTQ communities is essential in peace-building processes for truly inclusive peace to get established.Homophobic and transphobic violence has long precededthe declaration of any area as a conflict zone or battleground. In most cases negotiating a queer peace agreement is a win-win for the LGBTQ community as they get to contest the pre-conflict structural violence against LGBTQ in these very societies. Suppressing and attacking homosexual orientation are used as a tool by both state and non-state actor and groups in armed conflicts to create an atmosphere of humiliation and shame.
In most post-colonial nation-states, the legacy of homophobic colonial laws and religious taboos converge to criminalize homosexuality. If legally decriminalized, the political and cultural homophobia continues to stigmatize the LGBTQ community. In theQueer Politics of Postcoloniality, Rahul Rao forewarns that the project ofdecolonizingitself can become a potential carrier of politicizing homophobia –homosexuality being ‘Un-African’is such an example.
The antithetical tension between theology and being queer has brought forth the constant tussle between ‘tradition’ and ‘modernity’. Jasbir Puar reads homonationalism as‘a constitutive and fundamental reorientation of relationship between the state, capitalism and sexuality’rather than a tool for identity politics alone.  For a nation to be declared to be sovereign, homonationalism entails that acceptance of liberal LGBTQ rights becomes a parameter.
In studying the Sandinista Revolution inNicaraguain the twentieth century, Florence E. Babb brings out the oscillating attitude of theSandinismowhen it came to male homosexuality as distinct from female homosexuality. A case in point is the LGBTQ community inIraqwho, without any governmental safety net, family support or normative theology in their society, face higher hostilities. Reportedly, male homosexuality confronts alesser propensity for fear-driven livingas juxtaposed to female homosexuality.
Quite often the violence that occurs is multi-dimensional. An attack on doubly marginalized queer lies at the intersection of numerous grids of structural violence – the queer dalit, the distinctions between rural and urban queer, the class dimension and the racial justice within queer circles. The intersectionalities within the queer community pose a dilemma for standardized and straight-jacketed policies.
We need to find newer interlinkages within the societal fabric that remain marginalized but are present. Asclimate changeexacerbates conflict, deprivations of the queer population will aggravate. Queer-sensitive refugee camps and aid programs require enriching data from global humanitarian agencies and national statistical organizations.Homophobic and transphobic violence is normalized in non-war contexts, so much so that most studies in gauging violence towards the queer, forget to coalesce the spotlight on post-conflict resistance and blockages to pre-conflict preventive measures regarding the queer populations.
As a result, localized infrastructures for peace need to manage such contradictions. Positive peace education includes queer sensitivities and must be introduced across schooling systems and pedagogical training for educators. Transitional Justice requires psycho-social trauma counselling to be sensitive to variegated sexualities and non-heteronormative family dynamics.Problematizing homophobia itself reveals how distinct cultural homophobia can be from political homophobia.
No scale of marginalization needs to be ranked. Class, race, and caste issues are equally crucial as addressing the queer way of life has been. In fact, all are addressed mutually. If compartmentalized, none get tackled. The LGBT people with disabilities and ageism within the queer communities require further mainstreaming and policy discussions. Civil Society Organizations of the ‘Global South’ must take to indigenizing the hegemonic comprehension of LGBTQ rights in a holistic manner while also ensuring to recognize the shortfalls of romanticizing the indigenous lexicon and perception of the queer. The integration of masculinities in peace-building will deeply transform the re-construction of gender relations in post-conflict societies. The tenets ofYogyakarta Principlesand theFree and EqualCampaignby UNDP must be synthesized with Women, Peace and Security Agenda to queer conflict transformation and peace-building for localized conflicts.
The institutionalization of the non-binary in global and national narratives is the need of the hour toprevent obscuring of transphobic and homophobic violence under the larger umbrella of gender-based violence. The heteronormative eye perceiving the queer as an outsider will inevitably stunt the impact that international and national policies claim to handle. The inclusion of queer population in policymaking should not remain a figment of queer rhetoric or queer utopia. Only then will policies be truly gender-transformative.

[ANALYSIS] The US-Latin American Policy Strategy: A Dialogue From Both Perspectives,"The two presidencies which have followed the Obama administration have governed in the backdrop of an increasingly polarized nation and both have sought to differentiate themselves from his administration. ForTrump, his opposition to Obama-era policies stems from a multitude of factors such as hisfraught relationshipwith the former president as well as thepopulismwhich mobilized his base, in turn serving as the only policy framework from which he could govern without repercussions.
The policy agenda which grew out of his 2016 campaign would ultimately become the orthodoxy of the Republicans as Trump received almost unshakeable support from Republican voters around being a non-establishment candidate and he was further supported byconservative organizationswho were able to pursue their policy agenda through his administration.
ForBiden, the road to becoming president involved contending within a crowded field of Democratic candidates to be seen as thesuccessorto former President Obama even though he had served as his vice president. President Biden was elected upon a platform of a return to normalcy in the conduct of the office as well as the conduct of the nation’sforeign affairs. Consequently, the election which propelled him to the nation’s highest office wasdividedalong the method of voting due to the impact of the pandemic which has given way toelection fraudconspiracies driven by former President Trump. In the shadow of internal and external issues influencing the country, both presidents have sought to engage with Latin America in their own way.
ThoughLatin Americais an expansive region comprising many different cultures and languages, theUnited Statesis often predominantly concerned withMexicodue to its geographic proximity. This view is especially true with immigration as the nation is a land bridge between Latin America and the United States. In addition, Mexico also accounts for asignificantstate of origin for U.S. immigrants. Former President Trump began an antagonistic stance on immigration early into hiscandidacywhen he made disparaging comments regarding Mexican immigrants. As he became president, his two most central policy points toward curbing immigration from Latin America wereconstructinga wall along the southern border and a controversialzero-tolerancepolicy toward illegal immigration which was intended to deter migrants from coming to the United States. Furthermore, Trump expanded the number ofapprehensionsat the border and within the U.S. by expanding the authority of immigration officials. The conclusion of his policies concerning curbing illegal immigration was the failure of the border wall to act as adeterrencefor migrants and harming the reputation of the country over how the policies seemed to disregardhuman rights, which is a value that the U.S. has championed for decades in Latin America.
During his campaign for the presidency, Biden released hisplatformfor immigration which appealed to voters based onhow immigration has been essential to the American experienceand advocated arollback of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
One of the first policies that he was able to undo was haltingfederal fundingfor the construction of the border wall by ending the state of national emergency proclaimed by Trump to appropriate federal funds for the project. This move was not met without opposition as the attorney generals ofTexas and Missourisued the Biden administration for halting the building of the border wall. Another policy objective that he hoped to achieve was the repeal of Trump’sasylum policiesto live up to the image of the nation presented in the famous poem “The New Colossus” by Emma Lazarus. However, when it came time to demonstrate the administration’s commitment to these values, they turned awayHaitiansat the southern border and deported them to Port-au-Prince viaflights.
The administration has shown thatit is willing to aid migrants when there exist extraordinary circumstances which provide bipartisan supportor instances where it was a direct consequence of the administration’s policies. Such instances have included welcomingUkrainian refugeesto bolster the resolve ofUkraineby projecting solidarity and also have included theresettlementof Afghans who were impacted by the administration’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. When the administration attempted to make a meaningful attempt toeliminatehurdles to applying for asylum like Title 42, the motion was struck down by a federal judge. With inconsistent messaging on immigration policy in an agenda with limited political capital to push forth the most pressing policy objectives, it is unlikely for the administration to undertake any large-scale immigration reform before themidterm elections. The future of immigration reform in the country faces an uphill battle as the issue is viewed increasingly alongpartisanlines and even when made a priority under Trump, it was clear that a greater degree ofresources, as well as personnel, will be needed to even accomplish border security.
Trump would ultimately capitalize on resentment toward globalization in his 2016 presidential campaign, especially within theRust Beltwhich was neglected by bothDemocratsand by the post-recession economic recovery as the majority ofjobswent to white-collar workers rather than the working class which hashistoricallybeen the backbone of the region’s economy. The marriage of Trump and the Rust Belt voters would propel him to the White House and also have an impact on his foreign policy concerning Latin America as they had placed their hopes on the premise that he would be able to reverse the trends ofglobalization. For them, the most present manifestation of globalization was NAFTA and it was something that needed to be rectified in favor of Americans. Trump then took this into consideration to renegotiate the agreement to replace it with theUnited States Mexico Canada Agreementalong with wanting to further solidify his image as an astutebusinessman. Although he positioned himself as an outsider in his campaign, he had embraced members of theRepublican establishmentwith positions within his administration. Such is evident in keeping with theorthodoxy of conservative foreign policywith the sanctioning of leftist regimes likeVenezuelaandCubain the waning years of his presidency. In addition, he threw his support behind the former president of the Venezuelan National AssemblyJuan Guaido, and Brazilian presidentJair Bolsanaroto act as a bulwark against the leftist governments in the region just as the U.S. had done in theCold War.
Policy in Latin Americafor the Biden administration wasnot a high priorityfor them as they sought to repair relations with America’stransatlantic partnersas the second most important priority and to continue thepivot to Asiataking preeminence over other issues.
The outbreak of theRusso-Ukrainian Warhas taken attention away from Latin America to a secondary priority of maintaining the post-war security architecture that the United States constructed to act as a rampart against communism spreading across the Atlantic. When modern powers are in the process of creating new geopolitical orders and in other circumstances they come across asecurity dilemmasimilar to a fox wishing to enter a henhouse to procure its contents. In a situation of parity, the farmer will have enough of a deterrent to protect the henhouse, but like in the security dilemma, it comes at the expense of the fox. It is when the farmer no longer provides the deterrent in which the fox is left alone with the contents of the henhouse that the fox must make a decision. It can either raid all the contents within, taking more than it can chew, or leave the contents alone in a gesture of goodwill to form an understanding with the farmer. The decision is one that faces states that forges an order to face the existing one. When the henhouse is taken in packs, history has shown that when the fox who tries to create an understanding will revert to the wishes of those it is seeking to accomplish the task with if it cannot fulfill the leadership it wishes to undertake.
Such was shown when Wilsonyieldedto Clemenceau the fate of Germany and howSecretary of StateWarren Christopher ceded the policy of NATO expansion to post-Soviet States by doubting that Russia would fully reform. From the U.S. succumbing to the “The old political system based on force and with its tricks and rivalries” as the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference described over 100 years ago, Russia saw such expansion as justification for its own adoption of an aggressive foreign policy within its traditional sphere of influence. Moreover, A Europe with a 21st-century economic model but the behavior of 20th-century power and a Russian Federation with the behavior of a 20th-century power ensures there will be tensions to come for years to come in thepost-Sovietspace as there lies the final project for integration by Brussels which they see enlargement as equal to security. Due to this crisis in regional security, the leaders of the West have calledsummitsto address it but little of substance has been produced as their main purpose is the projection of union to their adversaries. A similar policy can be found in the Biden doctrine which can be defined as the attempted projection of leadership in multilateral institutions but in practice is more of bare maintenance than what is required in the current multipolar world order.
The most exemplar practice of this doctrine lies in theSummit of the Americaswhere the administration excluded leftist governments from attendance. After the end of the Cold War, the existential threat to security that leftist governments were replaced by a foreign policy that shifted to enforcement of property rights which had to be respected for favorable treatment from the United States. While sanctions have become the primary instrument for the enforcement of the neoliberal order, they still accomplish the same policy objectives set in a time when the USSR existed. Many Latin American nations have rejected neoliberalism throughelectionsthat have placed leftist candidates in halls of power. As the U.S, has been busy pursuing a policy that is predicated upon conditions that do not exist anymore, China has been making inroads throughout the world through investment.Chinahas taken up the mantle as the champion of developing and middle-income states just as the Soviets did in the 20th century.
However, there are certainly flaws in both theWestern modelas well as theChinesemodel of development. Here lies the promise of the region to provide an alternative and help the Americas forge a new order for the 21st century. This may seem like a strange statement but it had a hand in crafting the last geoeconomic system through the influence of theChicago Boys. The potential to be a laboratory for different models of economic growth is shown inEl Salvador, where the government has made a substantial investment in non-regulated currency. The region is one of a diverse array of governments and seeking only to have one form is one that weakens the security of the United States. This perspective is one that can be found amongEuropean analysts, but the region faces a far lower bar to clear in this regard because there exists a different geopolitical reality than the European Union.
No South American project relies upon liberalism for legitimacy and security. One of the few hurdles foreign policy practitioners within the U.S. need to clear to meaningfully engage with the region is eliminating the vestiges of the Cold War policy that have weakened relations with the neighbors within our hemisphere. By having a policy rooted in non-interference, the United States can limit the influence of China by championing economic models developed in tandem with our Latin American partners which can also serve the interests of ananxious Europethrough a newfound understanding between Washington and the region. The Global South is slowly becoming more distant from the West due tohistoric grievancesand their owneconomic interestsbeing harmed by their archaic rivalries. Only by embracing a region that very much has theeconomic potentialto become a more assertive presence in global affairs, can the international system become more inclusive to states that are not great powers.
For much of modern history, historians have witnessed civilizational conflicts which have shaped our collective destiny such as Carthage and Rome. With it being a norm in contemporary international affairs, some of our closest partners are more enamored with the academic debate of a Sino-American rivalry that they have entertained the idea of pursuing apolicythat divides us and weakens our collective security. By providing the region a greater stake in global affairs, the story of this century does not have to be told as a battle of two poles, but instead as an expansion of self-determination bolstered by their potential economic andsecuritycontributions to a revised international system that is equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century through a new hemispheric order.
The campaign was a showdown between two different models of international approaches to the region: while Donald Trump exploded the anti-left movement, Joe Biden brought hope for more integration, opportunities, and fewersanctions with a more comprehensive view.
However, with two years in office, the Democratic President has done almost nothing to integrate the region, nor to exercise the“broader approach”that Democrats promised in the campaign. This “new” model was translated into small changes from the Trumpist line.
Despite the promises of attacking the illegal immigration issue by looking at the bigger picture, Biden continued with the policy of blocking the migrant caravans coming fromHonduras,Guatemala, andEl Salvador, also known as the northern triangle. Even though there was a relief package announced by Kamala Harris to improve the living conditions in these countries, life has not improved and theflow of migrants never stopped.Throwing money at the problem does not appear to be an integral approach.
[The U.S.] should have a relationship based on development and progress, not punishment.
This was a powerful statement by Julissa Reynoso, former U.S. ambassador to Uruguay. Still, the reality is that the government has not changed the dynamic of sanctions against governments that don’t agree with Washington.
The latest example of this disagreement between Latin American countries was the regional summit to be hosted by the United States in early June, where the Mexicanpresident, with the support of his pairs from Argentina and Bolivia, proposed a boycott of the international meeting due to the absence of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. The Honduran President Xiomara Castro de Zelayasaid on Twitter,
“If not all nations are present, it’s not a Summit of the Americas.”
Christopher Dodd, appointed by Joe Biden as a special adviser to the Summit of the Americas, met withAlberto Fernández, President ofArgentinain Buenos Aires. With the aim of finding out if the Head of State was going to attend the event, at the meeting the president criticized the absence of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua at the Summit, since they were not invited by the organizers– putting into question the very presence of Argentina in the meeting.
Even the ultra-right President,Jair Bolsonaro, in spite of bitterly accepting the invitation,did not hide his criticismof Biden’s policies in the region:
“With Trump, everything was going very well. We had a lot of combined things to do here, in Brazil. Among other things, exploiting oil adding value for Brazil, with Biden, there was simply a freeze.”
On the G20 summit held in October 2021 in Rome, hewrote:
“I found him in the G20, but he passed in front of me as if I didn’t exist. It was his treatment with everyone. I don’t know if it’s the age”
The only common ground in the region, in the alt-right governments, and in the leftist administrations, is that the hope Biden meant for the region, was a mereillusion.
As Washington provides no alternative for development, or trade deals to tempt the Latin American nations to stay under the U.S orbit. As if it was a move from the Cold War era, the Chinese Communist Party is providing more markets for the Latin American nations to export. Recently, the third economy of Latin America,Argentina, joined the trade agreement known as the “Silk Road”.
This alliance was seen by many as a threat to the American hegemony in the region,Matt Gaetz, representative of the state of Florida to the US Congress and an ally of former President Donald Trump, expressed his concernsby affirming:
While the Biden Admin, the media, and many in Congress beat the drums of war for Ukraine, there is a far more significant threat to our nation.
Again, the Biden administrationfails to promote development by not offering alternative sources of financefor the Latin American economies. The sloth of the Democratic governor is pushing Latin America to the Chinese armswith almost 22 countries of the region joining the treaty,including countries that remain in the political sphere of influence of the US as Uruguay or Chile. The agreement also includes anti-American nations such as Venezuela or Cuba.
This is a high stake issue for US security, due to the fact that this is the first time in American history where a foreign power is able to influence the countries that traditionally belong to their sphere without the use of military strategy (as the Russians used to in the missile crisis via Cuba) but with economic incentives that include real financing for infrastructure and the possibility of being included in a new international division of labor.
The threat to US security does not rely on China’s economic influence in America’s “Front Yard”, it relies on the lack of creativity of the Democratic and the Republican establishment to approach the Latin American issues with opportunities that include real development and incorporation of the thousands of Latin Americans that live in poverty. The Bush administration, with all its flaws, proposed in 2006 in Mar del Plata, Argentina, the last US commercial agreement in the scale and access to international aid. That occurred 16 years ago.
The end of this relationship is uncertain, again. President Biden summoned an American Summit in L.A, with little to offer but his political muscle by excluding Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Cuba. Other than tempting the region with economic opportunities, the summit resulted in few initiatives.
If the Biden administration does not offer the Latin American nations economic packages to develop that surpass the Chinese investments, the US economic hegemony will get weaker, and in the long term, its security.

Nigeria: A Rich Country That is Still Poor,"In 1956,Nigeriadiscovered its oil resources. In the next decade, Nigeria started to explore its oil industry by opening it up to it to international business. Today, the country is the world’s11th largest oil producer, with an average daily production of 1.8 million barrels in 2020.The petroleum sector represents over 90% of exports in the country. Dr. Furro, a local professor at Albany State University, highlighted that although the revenue is equivalent to billions of dollars, only a small portion of the budget from that addresses the issues of social welfare, public health,and education.
Dr. Furro researches issues that face Nigeria, namelypovertyanddemocracy. What he has concluded is that there is more to Nigeria’s wealth than is known to us. It appears that the the country’s strategy to shift the blame onto the West for the challenges they are currently facing is not fully supported by evidence. The billions that Nigeria losses annually are stemming from the lack of accountability of its administrative structure.
Analyses suggest that political leaders are not being held accountable for such a mismanagement of the national resources. With revenue that has been raised in the country, there is nothing to show for it. According to Dr. Furro,
“there is little evidence to suggest the oil windfall is reflected in improving the social and economic well-being of the people of Nigeria.”
What is seen as being the primary factor in high poverty is corruption, even though the country has thesecond-largest oil reservoir inAfrica.
Leaders in Nigeria have destabilized the political system of the country to a huge degree by abusing power for personal gain.Funds are being misappropriated dailyby political leaders who have reportedly given preference to fulfilling personal interest over national ones.Corruptionin Nigeria has had a negative impact in the recent past and has been accepted as a norm.
Natural resource revenues generate the most income forthe Nigerian government. In ‘Poverty in Nigeria: Some Dimensions and Contributing Factors,’ Chimobi Ucha highlights that instead of the income being used for developmental purposes, it is circulated among the political office holders and their families, which leaves the rest of the people in poverty. Instead of paying attention to the affairs of the citizens of Nigeria, the government mismanages the funds that are supposed to form part of the upkeep of the country and its people, she adds.
In ‘Poverty in Nigeria: Some Dimensions and Contributing Factors‘, there are several issues involved with bad governance in Nigeria such as usage and implementation of detrimental policies. Corruption is causing an increase in inequality and poverty in the country has led to high crime rates. Lackof educationis another importantcause of povertyinNigeria. Being able to participate in society and the economy is important, but in absence of the basic foundation that education provides, poverty starts to take root.
Chimobi Ucha enlistsunemploymentas another factor that contributes to poverty in Nigeria. Poverty and unemployment go hand in hand. Lack of income and increased cost of living lead to deterioration of living conditions. It is often stated that graduates in Nigeria sit at home with no hope of employment. She further adds in ‘Poverty in Nigeria: Some Dimensions and Contributing Factors‘ that the government is capable but unwilling to provide jobs for the unemployed youth. Employment in Nigeria is not dependent on whether you meet the requirements but rather on informal contacts. The number of quality jobs in the economy is low and government resources are misallocated.
AID TO FIGHT POVERTY IN NIGERIA
Foreign aidto Nigeria has been popular in the global aid sector. In 2005 and 2006, foreign aid increased from $6.4 billion to $11.4 billion, which is the biggest increase yet according toImpact of Foreign Aids on Poverty Alleviation in Nigeria.
Foreign assistance may help mitigate poverty in underdeveloped nations across Nigeria, which could be done through funding public developmental initiatives, butthere is a different sense in Nigeria about the idea that foreign aid could combat poverty. Many believe that Nigeria is not in need of foreign assistance to try to overcome poverty because crude oil and foreign payments are enough to relieve poverty in the country.
Fighting corruption will not only reduce poverty in the immediate future but will help reduce it in the years to come.  Not holding corrupt public officials accountable results in funds from the public coffers meant for development projects not being used optimally. This has historically led to poor infrastructure development, as well as social welfare which leads to or results in poverty.
Diversifying the economy can help aid poverty in Nigeria. Nigeria is fully dependent on oil revenue which can become a multiplier problem. This dependency on natural resources is often referred to as “Dutch disease”,whereby natural resources make a country less competitive.Therefore, diversification of the Nigerian economy is vital to ensure that the economy stabilizes, which would ultimately act as effective poverty alleviation.

[ANALYSIS] Japan-France Bilateral Partnership: What Future Direction for Strategic and Non-Traditional Security Cooperation?,"The relationship betweenFranceandJapanhas historically been centered on economic engagement, with France being the second largest destination for Japanese direct investment inEuropeand Japan being the largest Asian investor in France. The construction of these strong commercial exchanges were the results of the Jacques Chirac presidency (1995-2007) driving diplomatic engagement with Japan – the former French President was a notablefan of sumo and Japanese art.
Over the past decade, however, the bilateral relationship has grown in leaps and bounds, focusing more on strategic ties, most notably sinceFrançois Hollande‘s state visit to Japan in 2013. This dynamic has arisen from both powers’ desire to preserve international rules and norms amidst the expansionist projection of authoritarian powers on the international scene.
Both France and Japan have notably been at the forefront of aggressive military and diplomatic practices of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). At the height of theCOVID-19 pandemic, CCP delegates penned abrasive false statements about the Macron government’s mishandling of the health crisis. Across the East China Sea, Chinese warships regularlyapproachedJapanese territorial waters off the Senkaku Islands.
Against these challenges, during the last Foreign and Defense Ministers meeting (2+2), France and Japan emphasized the importance of enhancing bilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. It remains unclear, however, what the strengthening of bilateral ties means in practical terms. Nonetheless, with the Indo-Pacific strategies of both powers committed to upholding the existing security and economic order, there is room for ongoing practical and ambitious bilateral cooperation.
With the recent French presidential election offeringEmmanuel Macronanother five years in office, there is an opportunity for Japan and France to leverage maritime cooperation. At the last2+2 talks, both countries recognized thedeteriorating security environment in the East and South China Seas. Over the past year, French and Japanese maritime forces were actively involved in maritime security exercises: in April French and Japanese frigates conductednaval drillsin the South China Sea; in May their navies participated in“Arc-21” exercisesoff the coast of Kagoshima, Japan.
To further strengthen maritime interoperability and engagement, it is critical thatFranceengages in existing institutional security frameworks in the Indo-Pacific, of which Japan is a member. Accession to theQuadrilateral Security Dialogue(Quad) would allow the Elysée to strengthen its strategic cooperation with Japan against the common challenge ofChinawhile maintaining varying levels of strategic autonomy, an important component of French strategic thinking.
Butwhy is France’s inclusion important in safeguarding the rules-based order?
France is anIndo-Pacific nation. In the South Pacific, France maintains possession of small island territories ranging from French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia – home to France’s largest military station in the region. With regard to the Indian Ocean, France is a significant player through its control of various islands, most notably Reunion and Mayotte. France’s series of dependencies in the Indian Ocean allows Paris to exercise control of an Exclusive Economic Zone that encompasses 2,650,013 km².
This human and geographical connection with the Indo-Pacific is complemented by a significantmilitary presence:8,000 soldiers and dozens of ships pre-positionedacross several bases. The state of affairs in the Indo-Pacific, as a result, have significant geopolitical consequences for France’s strategic interests. China’s ongoing destabilization and coercion of maritime rules and norms are ultimately detrimental to French possessions in both oceans. The recently signedsecurity agreementbetween Beijing and Honiara, which could see the People’s Liberation Army develop an overseas naval base within 1584 km from Noumea, attests to this, as it could undermine the stable, law-based regional maritime order that has brought unprecedented peace to the South Pacific since the Second World War.
“France is a key partner for Australia. We share those historical ties going back to the First World War and we share common interests in a stable Indo-Pacific region because France is, of course, an Indo-Pacific nation”.
The Quad appreciates France’s engagement in the Indo-Pacific. In April 2021, the four Quad countries joined France in the French Navy’s La Pérouse exercise held in the Bay of Bengal. France cooperates with Quad countries at the minilateral level: there exists a France-Australia-India trilateral on maritime safety and a Japan-Australia-France trilateral on South Pacific affairs.
With the damage to Franco-Australian relations subsided with Paris and Canberra agreeing to mend their differences following former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s unceremonious termination of a $600 billion contract with French shipbuilder Naval Group, there is a unique opportunity for the democratic grouping to expand the mechanism. Newly elected Australian Prime MinisterAnthony Albanesehas notably called Franco-Australian ties “an absolutely vital relationship” and recently met with Emmanuel Macron in a first high-level bilateral meeting between the two countries since the scrapped submarine deal. And with Franco-American relations emerging more quickly from theAUKUS crisis, culminating in an ambitiousroadmaplaying the groundwork for stronger bilateral and transatlantic cooperation in key areas that include the Indo-Pacific, the momentum is there to deepen the relationship.
A France-Japan partnership on digital infrastructure would bring urgent modernization and connectivity needs to developing countries in the Indo-Pacific. Growing income inequality and high rates of poverty threaten the digital transformation of the region’s small and middle powers. While notable recipients such as the Maldives, Cambodia, and Tonga have been major beneficiaries of Chinese aid and investment projects, mounting debt distress threatens to see these developing countries selling their strategic assets to the CCP, and thus, advance Beijing’s quest to develop a more Sino-centric regional order.
Technological innovationwill inevitably be key to competing against China’s economic statecraft programs: such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The transformative impact of a digital revolution in small and middle powers would bring a wave of change to the economic and social well-being of the people and help these countries bridge the technology gap with high-income countries. France and Japan will have to act decisively as the PRC has already signed agreements on cloud computing, artificial intelligence capabilities, e-commerce, and mobile payment systems withPakistanandLaos. The onus is now on the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to lay the foundations for joint collaboration on digital technologies that challenge China’s growing hegemony.
Climate changeis a non-traditional threat to international security and the future existence of modern civilization. More frequent or intense extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification will pose a range of threats to the well-being and security of countries in the Indo-Pacific.
In Southeast Asia, there are already examples of how climate variability affects natural resources, economic hubs, and energy systems, withrising sea levels threatening to flood and salinate the Mekong Deltawhich could endanger economic development in southern Vietnam. France and Japan have equally succumbed to the devastating effects of climate change recently: in March the northern Japan Fukushima coast was rocked by a powerful magnitude7.4 earthquakewhile wind gusts exceeding200 km/hfrom tropical cyclone Niran has brought damage to critical infrastructure on the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.
Yet efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change have been hamstrung byChina’s desire to build more coal-fired power plants to meet its growing energy demand:88%of the continent’s primary energy supply comes from fossil fuels. ForDr. Chunping, given the scale of the PRC’s energy consumption from coal, the CCP will not meet its climate goals unless it imminently expands its renewable energy capacity.
Climate securityhas long been a focus of the French and Japanese chancelleries. Unfortunately, the sixth meeting of French-Japanese foreign and defense ministers did not address the importance of leveraging joint diplomatic efforts. Yet, according tothe latest report by a UN climate panel, the negative effects of climate change are accumulating significantly faster than predicted less than a decade ago. Against the backdrop of soaringenergy pricestriggered byRussia‘sterrifying invasion of Ukraine, the need for a reliable and affordable energy source has become even more vital. French energy companies have already starteddiversifying their importsto American suppliers of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), but Japan isscramblingto find a way out of the Russian Sakhalin-2 LNG project. As warfare increases greenhouse gas emissions, expanding LNG import diversification in the short term while increasing investment in rapidly deployable clean energy infrastructure would send a strong message to the Kremlin.
Success in keeping global warming below 2º C also requires both powers to intensify their green investments towards the Indo-Pacific. A recentBloombergreportnoted that many Indo-Pacific states cannot meet their 2050 energy transition needs from domestic onshore solar and wind generation. It is critical that France and Japan develop a green foreign investment strategy, particularly for the energy-poor countries of South and East Asia. These are highly aspirational demands of two middle size powers, but with the right will and leadership, they are not impossible to achieve.

"Escaping Meltdown, For Now: Peru’s Economy Goes On","Despite being hardly hit by theCovid-19 pandemicand a permanent state of political crisis,Peru’s economy is doing remarkably better than it should due to a fresh wave of domestic investments and an increase in public spending. However, the country still faces serious challenges to its long-term economic health.
After going through five presidents in the past five years, and living through a pandemic that devasted markets around the world, Peru still managed to record an impressive 13.3% GDP growth in 2021. Now, with successive impeachment attempts against sitting president Pedro Castillo, nationwideprotests, and awar in Ukrainedisrupting global supply chains; one could be excused to think that this is the year that the Peruvian economy would crumble for good. And yet, according toprojectionsrevised by the International Monetary Fund in April 2022, the country’s GDP is still expected to grow by 3% in 2022. Among major economiesin South America, expectations for the Peruvian economy are far worse than only Colombia and Argentina. This article explores the reasons behind Peru’s resilience towards recent political shockwaves and discusses a few challenges yet to be faced by the country’s economy.
Peruhas long been heralded as one ofLatin America’s main success stories. From the beginning of the twenty-first century institutional reforms took the country from a position of hyperinflation and economic decline to becoming one of the strongest performers in the region. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, seizing the momentum provided by favorable external conditions which included a commodity boom, Peru engaged in a series of important macroeconomic reforms. These reforms included fiscal discipline, monetary stringency, and market deregulation that led to a strong increase in foreign investment in the country. The result was anaverageGDP growth of 6.4% between 2004 and 2013, approximately 2 percent higher than the rest of the Latin American average.
However, foreign investment was not there to save Peru during its post-pandemic recovery, as investments are still far from 2019 levels. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, annual FDIinflowsin Peru fell by 87.8% in 2020, dropping from USD 8.05 billion in 2019 to USD 982 million in 2020, the worst level since 2020. An inflow of USD 6.2 billion in 2021 has marked a robust recovery for the Peruvian economy. Yet,Peru is far from regaining its attractiveness as FDI flows will most likely not return to the pre-2020 levels.
When investors from the outside were not very keen to bet their money on Peru, national private equity found its way to boost the country’s recovery. In 2021, private investment in Peru increased by 34% relative to 2020 and 12% relative to 2019. These investments especially in themining sectorhelped propel Peru’s economy to achieve ahigher-than-expectedrecovery. For instance, Anglo American Perú alone wasresponsiblefor USD 5.5 billion in new investments in 2021, representing approximately a 30% increase in investments for the mining sector, one of the most important in Peru.
There has been a lack of international funds. It was up to the Peruviangovernment for the first time in a while to take charge of economic recovery by using the oldest trick in the Keynesian macroeconomic book: public spending. Notably, publicspendingin 2021 was the biggest in Peru’s history, with PEN 39.1 billion (USD 10.21 billion) in expenditure. This figure represents a 21% increase from the previous record, set in 2018, and a 38% increase from 2020.
Peru’s newly found internal investment clout has been able to keep the country’s economy afloat despite the political upheaval. Peru’s economy isn’t permanently safe, it just managed to put off the worst-case scenario. A persistent lack of reforms to modernize the country and a growing public debt present a  more serious risk for the country in the long run than a temporary drought of foreign capital.
BCRPData, the statistics department of the Peruvian central bank,reportedthat business confidence in the long-term health of the Peruvian economy has hit its lowest level since May 2020. Additionally, BBVA Researchpredictsprivate investment to fall by 5.4% in 2022, not only due to political crisis but also due to the failure of some mining projects on which the country is very dependent. Therefore, national private investment may have helped the country regain traction in its post-pandemic recovery, but future flows are nothing but dubious. The political infighting keeps the country from making new reforms to steer the country away from its dependency on the export of primary goods.
On the fiscal side, Peru’s debt to GDP ratio worryinglyincreasedfrom 25.2% in the first quarter of 2019 to 35.9% in the last quarter of 2021, way over the 30% ceiling established by thelegislative decree n. 1276, the golden standard of fiscal responsibility established by the country in December 2016. Furthermore, the country is expected to run a fiscal deficit of 2.5% of its GDP, in 2022, which is also an overshoot of the 1% ceiling established by Peru’s fiscal rules. Soon, President Castillo will find himself between a rock and a hard place in spite of his continuous escapes from successive impeachment attempts.  His administration will need to decide whether to rein in public spending and face public outcry or let Peru’s budget likely go out of control.

Being a Feminist Activist in Turkey: The Voices to be Silenced,"TNGO Director of Investigative JournalismMargaux Seigneurexplores the intricacies of student activism in Ankara, Turkey through a conversation with two student activists.
When you talk to feminists in Turkey, violent music hits your ears, like a refrain that repeats itself ineluctably. This verse reflects the systematic violence faced by the part of the population that chooses to stand up and protest. This noisy minority denounces the persecutions that have spread like a pandemic again and again in a country where it isnot good to be a woman:Turkey.
In a small coffee shop hidden by a multitude of buildings on the frenetic street of Kizilay in Ankara, I met some of these young women, who courageously choose to stand up, shout for their rights, and remind a government that has forgotten them that they are there. There were a dozen students all committed to the struggle for therights of womenand theLGBTQ+ community. All of them stood before me, proud and full of hectic energy that lit up the whole room. The first time I heard their voices was on a street one autumn evening. The civilian police prevented me from approaching them to report on the fights, though I couldn’t help but record their denunciatory voices singing the traditional slogan of the Kurdish feminist movement:
“Jin, Jiyan, Azadi”
Indeed, on the evening of November 5, 2021, about twenty women, activists, students, and feminists gathered to protest thesentencing of Çilem Doğan, a woman who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing her husband after experiencing repeated domestic and sexual violence.
Among this shy crowd of protesters stood a young law student of Ankara University; Nisan. Her academic path is not a fluke. Indeed, the young woman wishes to specialize in law to become a lawyer and eventually, defend the cause of women. Raised by a feminist mother, Nisan grew up with a sense of injustice that she vowed to address in the streets as well as on the university benches.
It all started when Nisan joined the feminist collective at her university, a powerful organization that brings together many feminist students from all over Turkey,Üniversitesi Feminist Kolektif.
Gradually, this law student began to suffer from the impact of sexism behind the heavy doors of her university.
“One of the academics at our university is strikingly brutal when it comes to mentioning women’s rights. He even called feminist activists “whores” in front of the whole class. I have witnessed sexism in my school and, therefore, in the law. Our academic dean is deeply sexist both in his language and in the words he writes in his book. We students learn directly from his book. I can’t let this go. I have to call out this sexist injustice that is passed on through education”.
As Nisan and her group attempted to protest against a system formatted by a sexist reading of the law, they themselves were targeted by the student groupTürkiye Gençlik Birliği(Youth Union of Turkey), a revolutionary ultra-nationalist organization known for their radical actions and ideas. This group announced that they “will not let the enemies of the state stage a protest under the guise of a dance”.
In 2019, as all ofSouth Americasang and danced against patriarchy and violence against women, feminists around the world borrowed the lyrics of the song “Un violator en tu camer” (a rapist in your path) and performed it in their respective countries. This movement did not escape the attention of Turkish feminist students of Ankara University, who also got together to shout:
“The patriarchy is a judge who judges us for being born and our punishment is the violence you can see. It is femicide. Impunity for my killer. It is disappearance. Is is rape. And it was not my fault, not the place where I was nor the dress that I chose! The rapist was you. It’s the police. The judges. The state. The president. The oppressive state is a rapist macho”.
In an attempt to replicate the protest dance at Ankara University, Nisan told me that, “a month after the protests started in South America, we wanted to do it on our campus. It should be noted that our campus is about the size of a kindergarten. We were seven women dancing in the courtyard.Suddenly hundreds of police officers came to surround us. The university prevented other students from going outside to avoid a general gathering,” stressed Nissan who went on to explain:
“The police were joined by the TBG, who defend the purity of the Turkish race. They shouted; “Take her, take them one by one.” At that moment, I was so angry that it gave me power. I threw pink paint on them. My legs were shaking but I did it anyway. This wasn’t my first altercation with them. Before that, they had already attacked me and insulted me by saying “This person is affiliated with the PKK, she is a terrorist!They say this to criminalize feminism when there is no correlation between the PKK and feminism“.
On that day, the Turkish police arrested 8 students, 5 women, and 3 men. The students were released later. It should be stressed that The KYK (Kredi ve Yurtlar Kurumu) scholarship of the students participating in the demonstration at the Ankara Cebeci Campus was revoked.
While feminist activists are facing pressure from ultra-nationalist groups such as the TBG, there is also a heavy atmosphere in the academic world that strongly opposes feminist demands.
Indeed, Nisan testifies that it is becoming more and more difficult to publiclyexpress activist ideas within the university itself:
“There is more and more pressure on us. Campus security won’t let us gather to protest. We are being persecuted within our university. The majority of the staff is affiliated with the AKP. This includes the security staff, administrators, etc. All these people prevent us from exercising our right to protest and express ourselves freely. For example, on 25 November, I was putting up signs in the corridor to promote the women’s rights demonstration. Every time I passed in the same corridor, the posters were torn down. I would put some up again, they would tear them up again. They are always watching us.”
While this may seem an insignificant story, in reality, it is a matter of thesystematic restriction of freedom of expression. In very concrete terms, certain ideas are not welcome and those who fight for them are persecuted for doing so. While, in theory, the university embodies the ultimate forum for the plurality of knowledge, Turkish practice shows a totally different reality. In addition to the methods of physically preventing students from gathering to protest, other mechanisms have been put in place to muzzle those who speak out.
“What happens when students are too annoying is that the administration kicks them out of dormitories. This is a big problem in the sense that rooms at the university are preferred by many young people because they are cheaper than flats. If you get kicked out you are literally on the street, forced to go back to your parents.  Another way they shame us is to write to our family. They investigate us and then denounce us to our parents. Some families are very conservative. If they see that our behavior is not in line with that of an honorable student, we can have big problems”.
This method ofshaminganddenouncingis, unfortunately, widespread inTurkey. Another activist namedDoguhas experienced this as well, stating:
“They have already sent letters to the address of my grandmother’s house. When I do activism it is something I have to think about constantly, it is in my head. For example, if you are an active activist and you start to disturb, the authorities may find your workplace, write to them and ask them to fire you. These things happen. There’s nothing theoretical about what I’m saying. The police spy on us, persecute us to discourage us in every way possible.”
While these obstructionist tactics against freedom of expression are constant, they have the particularity of intruding into the private lives of Turkish citizens. By sending letters to family homes and workplaces, the state is showing its overpowering influence over the whole of society. The message is clear: actions that are in opposition to the dominant ideology will have consequences for the family and professional life of the targeted person. This discipline of deterrence thus involvesthe spread of terror in the homes of activists.
This is a well-tested and proven method, and that is why it is repeated over and over again. When talking to committed activists, there is one topic that cannot be avoided: arrests!
“How many times have you been arrested? For how many hours? How old were you when you were first arrested?”
These little questions were strikingly commonplace among the feminists I talked to. In the café around the table where we sipped our kiwi tea, they explained that they have all been arrestedat least oncein their young lives as activists. They all laugh about it openly. It’s not a game, it’s part of the rules. Dogu told me her story:
“I hadn’t been demonstrating for long. During my first arrest, I was alone. It was a bit scary but I was prepared. They handcuffed me and put my hands behind my back to hurt me. My blood didn’t circulate in my thumb. It took me 3 weeks to feel it again. What was nice about my first arrest was that I made great connections. They have really bad techniques. They arrest everyone and put us all in the same place. Since the police take our mobile phones, we have to connect with the people around us. We have both the time and the space to talk to each other. I was able to talk to migrants, socialists, Kurds, and so on. All in all, it helped me to meet like-minded people, make contacts, discover new platforms, etc.They try to divide us but they create the perfect way for us to fight together. From then on I wanted to keep fighting. I was no longer alone.If I hadn’t been arrested, I would never have come into contact with the people who allowed me to continue the fight.”
Defiance towards the government grows day by day and police persecution is increasing accordingly. Arbitrary arrests and dissuasive methods have become an integral part of the Turkish activist landscape. The testimonies of these two courageous activists are not working of great originality. Indeed, arrests and demonstrations that start in the street and end up in hospitals, beatings, and insults are part of the routine for many women’s rights defenders in Turkey.
If the face of revolution is female, then the face of violence is covered with a helmet protecting it from the egalitarian words of the country’s young women activists. While freedom of expression is an inherent practice of our fundamental freedoms, it is proving to be more complicated to apply them in practice in Turkey. Yet, despite the intimidation and threats to their futures, Turkish feminists are still evoking their rights to a government that keeps breaking them.
“We are not stopping and we are not obeying. We are not scared of the state’s action. We will continue the women’s struggle until we will get our feminist revolution!”","June 24, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-second-voice/in-turkey-the-feminist-activists-struggling-to-defend-their-rights-are-facing-an-increasing-persecution/,Margaux Seigneur,thenewglobalorder.com,Human Stories
[ANALYSIS] What ‘Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow’ Means for Women’s Political Representation in the Southern African Development Community?,"In 2022, the international community and the African Union commemorated Women’s Days on March 8 and July 3, respectively. On both occasions, the theme underscored the link betweengender equalityandsustainability. The March commemoration specificallysoughtto “recognize the contribution of women and girls around the world leading the way onclimate change adaptation, mitigation, and response, to build a healthier and more equal and sustainable future for all”. However, the glaringunderrepresentation of women in politics worldwide, and not least in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, takes away from that recognition, as it impacts substantive contribution to sustainable solutions inclusive of the perspectives of women.
Socio-cultural underpinnings — masculine dominance of political life, poverty, and the cultural profiling of women —  that limit women’s participation in politics have a presence in southern African societies and are evidently translated into politics and governance. These factors continue to undermine women’s historical place in politics evidenced by their contribution to theliberation strugglein Africa and the SADC region from the 1950s to the 1990s.
The South African women’s 1956 protest against apartheid passing laws to the participation of Zimbabwean women as combatants within the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) attests that advancing their leadership in politics is necessary for a ‘sustainable tomorrow‘. InNamibia, a remarkable experience of women engaging in political resistance was the challenge of the “relocation of the residents of the old location to a new apartheid-styleblack township of Katutura” ordered by the Administrator General of the South African apartheid regime. Yet, after independence,only a few women occupied political positions in SADC governments. Even the politics of patronage — awarding of political positions to former participants of liberation movements — that came to characterize post-colonial states of southern Africa did not allot most former women liberation stalwarts prominent positions within political structures.
This is reflected by the current narrative of the region. While women constitute the majority of voters by virtue of being the more populous electorate, they continue to be underrepresented in political and decision-making positions. For example, women in Botswanaconstitute“just 10.77% in the National Assembly and 18% of councilors,” Zimbabwe’s women make up 14% of councilors, and Malawi has 23% of women in the National Assembly. The proportion of women in South Africa’s National Assembly is 45.25%, which is quite significant when compared to her neighboring countries which still have a long way to go to achieve gender parity.
Factors that Contribute to Women’s Underrepresentation in Politics in SADC
The overarching socio-cultural gender norms in the SADC region are patriarchal in nature with men at the forefront of leadership in all societal spheres and women placed at the periphery of decision-making. This gender-based imbalance impacts perspectives toward women’s capacity to lead. And, it hinders active political will in government and political party structures to introduce policies that support and improve women’s active participation in politics.
Secondly, the systematic departure from issue-based politics followed by the strategic adoption ofmoney politicshas significantly skewed the political playing field and placed women at a disadvantage. Women in the region have fewer means to access financial markets and income-generating activities. Therefore, they have comparatively less financial capital, which negatively impacts their viability as dependable candidates to political leadership and impacts their ability to campaign effectively. In the case ofMalawi, the average candidate contesting for a Parliamentary seat spent approximately $20,000 during the 2019 general elections. It is this commercialization of politics that compromises the democratic values and tenets to which fair elections find their ground and basis.
Thirdly,violence against women in politicsin recent years has manifested to include different forms of abuse such as humiliation, intimidation, damage to property, and assault. For the most part, the violent acts towards women in politics and elections are not condemned, which in turn fosters an environment that is not conducive to women’s active participation.
Beyond the many other factors that facilitate and contribute to women’s underrepresentation in politics in the SADC region, there is a continued pattern of insufficient political will to support the agenda of inclusive politics.
Measures Adopted to Address Women’s Underrepresentation in the SADC Region and Progress Made
The majority of SADC countries are signatories to several regional gender equality legal frameworks such as theSADC Protocol on Gender and Development, the2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and theConvention on the Elimination for forms of Discrimination against women (CEDAW). The SADC Protocol on Gender and Development takes on an equal opportunity approach and calls for the “use of special legislative measures to enable women to have equal opportunities with men to participate in electoral processes including in the administration of elections and as voters”. On the other hand,SDG 5calls for the gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, with women’s political participation noted as a key indicator.
Article 7 of CEDAW states:“Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country and, in particular, shall ensure to women, on equal terms with men to:
While the adoption of these regional frameworks marks an important step toward enhanced participation of women, greater commitment needs to be applied to the implementation of key strategies and initiatives that will allow for these goals to be realized.
2.Gender Quotas
Notably, according to International IDEA’sgender quota databaseand data fromEISA, several countries in the SADC region have adoptedLegislative Quotas, orPolitical Party Voluntary Quotafor Parliamentary representatives:
According todatacollected by the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa in 2019, there appears to be a positive correlation between countries that have adopted gender quotas and high levels of women’s representation in the national assembly – South Africa (45.25%), Zimbabwe (31.48%), Namibia (43.27%), Angola (26.82%), Tanzania(36.56%), Lesotho (22.13%), with a few outliers; Mauritius (18.84%) and Eswatini (6.15%). The SADC countries without gender quotas have comparatively fewer women in Parliament on average; Malawi (23%), Botswana (10.77%), Seychelles (21.21%), Democratic Republic of Congo (9.8%), Zambia (16.67%). Mozambique impressively demonstrates a 42.2% representation of women in it’s National Assembly. While it appears that the introduction of quotas makes a significant difference to women’s representation in Parliament, it remains unclear whether this translates to widespread national gains towards gender equality.
Sustainabilityrequires that equity in political representation and development interventions is achieved. The significant absence of women in politics and policy-making forums, notwithstanding the progress made to address it, challenges the notion of sustainability. Regionally, there is a missed opportunity to achieving 50% representation by 2015 as provided for by Article 12 of the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development. Countries like Botswana for example only got to accede to the Protocol five years into its implementation — it came into effect in 2013, which is indicative of the lack of political commitment to the realization of equal representation. While adopted gender quotas appear to have progressively increased women’s numbers in the legislatures of several countries in the region including South Africa, Tanzania, and Namibia, they are questioned for seemingly giving into meeting policy objectives rather than on appointment by merit. This to a certain extent defeats the purpose of sustainability and substantive contributions of qualified and dedicated women.
Governments and civil society organizations should therefore look into opportunities that can empower women financially and cognitively to take on political roles, as well as decision-making positions in government administrations across the SADC region. The newly launched Charter Project Africa intends to achieve the cognitive aspect by boosting civic engagement with the African Union’s Charter on Democracy, Elections & Governance (ACDEG). While this will raise awareness of the ACDEG and encourage participation in politics, it falls short of alleviating the financial obstacle of women entering into politics and competing with their counterparts. An aspect of advocating for public financing of women in politics should also be incorporated into such projects.
It would also benefit the project to train aspiring women in politics in the SADC region on the utilization of digital platforms to lobby for electorate support. It is noted that the accessibility and affordability of digital platforms have given rise to new forms of political mobilization and electioneering such that the election win of presidents like that of Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana was attributed to their engagements with civic technology. Moreover, a review of the electoral systems that are criticized for perpetuating the exclusion of women from participation in political structures and contesting elections such as the first past the post electoral system adopted in most SADC countries is ever more necessary.
“Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow” may have been inspired by the progress achieved to have women and girls contribute to climate change adaptation, mitigation, and response, to build a healthier and more equal, and sustainable future for all, globally. But, regions like SADC are yet to achieve desirable levels of representation in the domain of leadership of women.

The Role of Science in Society: The Chinese Social Credit System,"Since 2014, a particular social credit system – or SCS – has been under development, and promoted by theChinese government. The system, which augurs mandatory participation, is based on a data crossing behavioral scoring network, leading to individual punishments and rewards. Since its introduction, the SCS has been received apprehensively. Many highlight the dangers of research and development policies centered on an instrumental view of science, which conceals government surveillance limiting individual rights and freedoms.
There are multiple views on what the role of science in society should be. John Ziman (2003) in his articleScience and Civil Societydefines science as ubiquitous. That is, it is present in all social spheres. Many times, it is this omnipresence that causes mixed opinions regarding its uses and abuses. In the author’s words, “there are cases in which science promises salvation from evils, and others, as in the case of a nuclear warhead, in which it appears as an instrument of political power; although it can also, like verification technology, present itself as a peaceful answer to such nonsense. At times it is shown as a kind reason, at others as a mysterious incantation”.
According to Ziman, each social system assigns science a certain role and functions within it. However, the author observes a primacy of instrumental views of science over non-instrumental ones (i.e., science as a means to develop instruments for political, social, and economic use). Nowadays, this vision continues to be highly preponderant.
Regarding policy making in science and technology, Elzinga and Jamison (1996) in their articleThe Change of Political Agendas in Science and Technologyoffer a possibility of interpreting the forces that interact in the development of this type of policies, using a four-culture format. These are:
It is interesting to see what the authors detail about civic culture stating that, “while dominant cultures tend to orient scientific and technological policy in a “technocratic” direction, civic culture represents what has been called a “democratic strategy” for the Science and Technology (S&T) policy”. In other words, the influence of civic culture depends on the strength of the society.Therefore, its role is fundamental since it acts as a form of accountability toward other cultures.
As stated earlier, the SCS is a crossing data system that evaluates individual behaviors and scores them. This qualification leads to rewarding -what is understood as – “good” behavior and punishing the “bad”. The SCS was sanctioned and approved in 2014 by the Chinese State Council and formally named:Planning Project for the Development of a Social Credit System. Currently, pilot tests are active in different cities in China, such as Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Rongcheng. The official objectives outlined by the SCS focus on combating insecurity, increasing levels of transparency – both at an individual and business level-,  and improving the economic management of citizens by promoting institutionalized banking.
When implemented, all citizens would receive an initial thousand points and, based on their actions and behaviors, they would add or subtract them. Subtraction happens in cases of criminal activity, debt status, and consumption habits. For example, buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco in excess. On the other hand, points are added if citizens contribute to charitable causes, do not have debts, and demonstrate good behavior in public spaces.
Since its announcement, the SCS has been under criticism -mainly from Western societies- arguing the existence of a latent objective within this policy, namely high levels ofcontrolandsurveillanceof citizens. Mostly because data not only intersects at the interstate level but with companies based within China as well. This adds to already implemented policies, such asthe new security law in Hong Kong.
By implementing Elzinga and Jamison’s analysis of the four cultures in the SCS, a very strong bureaucratic culture that is highly intertwined with the economic variant emerges.Chinais a country that for decades has firmly developed along-term national science policy– for the most part, subordinately to the state.
In the case of the SCS, both cultures, bureaucratic and economic, would benefit since the system generates reciprocity. It improves social behavior as understood by the government and encourages the consumption of goods to maintain a ‘good’ reputation. Regarding the academic culture, little has been disclosed about the position of this sector. It is worth clarifying that academic culture tends to be subordinated to state financing. Therefore, SCS can be limited in its ability to fight for the academic values ​​of autonomy, integrity, objectivity, and control.
Finally, there is the civic culture. As stated prior, it often serves as accountability for others, ensuring a moderate application of scientific policies and not to the detriment of society itself. In the case analyzed, no social demonstrations against the implementation of the SCS have been observed. Although, based on interviews and testimonies from various documentaries, a position of acceptance or resignation is observed by not being able to change or question the measures adopted by the government. However, the fact that hitherto only pilot tests have been carried out and a national application of SCS is still pending makes it pre-emptive to gauge the full extent of the society’s reaction.
The Chinese case is paradoxical when applying the cultures established by Elzinga and Jaimson. In a political system as particular as this one, it could be thought that the preponderant role of one culture over the others -in this case, the bureaucratic one- “cancels” or leads to a zero-sum game where the promotion of scientific policies cannot be carried out in an efficient way.However, the development of a long-term science policy and the consequent technological advance inChinahas only advanced.
On the one hand, the Chinese social credit system can be thought of as a version, feared by Ziman, of utilitarian technoscience that takes advantage of advances in surveillance technology to control the population by encouraging certain behaviors, punishing others, and building a moral regime that assigns science a unique and instrumental role.
If the SCS was to be implemented at the national level, it would undoubtedly mark the materialization in public policy of a surveillance system highly nucleated by the state. However, on the other hand, the cross-linking of data for similar purposes is already present in most countries. For instance, the credit system in the United States which allows access to the purchase or rental of homes and cars depending on the citizen’s score.
There are ongoing debates around the world on how -or if- governments should regulate online spaces sincethey are no longer seen as the exception but as the norm. Numerous times -and as the pandemic has reiterated – social relations, economic transactions, spaces for debate, and even the education of entire generations take place online.
The case study discussed in this analysis can be helpful to the current debates in steering the defining of a future relationship between science and society. Ziman’s vision remains valid as he claims, “we should not identify (science) with utilitarian technoscience but ensure its freedom to perform the equally essential non-instrumental functions that sustain and enrich our much-appreciated pluralist democracy”. It could be said then that a possible answer to the problem of theprimacy of technocracy-and taking up the concepts of Elzinga and Jamison- is a strong civic culture that serves as a counterweight to scientific policies.","July 21, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-role-of-science-in-society-the-chinese-social-credit-system/,Carola López,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
[Analysis] A Fortified or Pearsonian Middle Power? Canada’s Strategic Dilemma with Hard Power Politics,"“Strong, Secure, and Engaged” are three words key to understanding Canada’s national security and defence posture. Incorporated into along-term comprehensivedefence and security policy in 2017, Canada has sought to use these three words to respond to the emerging threats to its national security and provide the necessary tools to keep Canada’s territorial integrity, political system, and its people safe from the emerging threats of a precarious international order.
However, with the ongoing war in Ukraine still raging; Russian seemingly undeterred and more determined to maintain a vigorous geosecurity posture in the wake of its military setbacks; and China maintaining a watchful eye for achieving regional hegemony in the Indo-Pacific, Canada needs to recognize that its national security and defence strategies are outdated for a modern international order that reaffirms the utility of hard power politics.
In this finalinstalmentof a three-part analysis on Canadian foreign policy, this article builds off the call for Canadian security and defence strategies to return as avital instrumentof its foreign policy and the need for Canada to posture itself as amulti-peripheral middle powerthrough the incorporation of hard power politics into its national security and defence planning and operations.
Canada’s national security and defence strategies have long been characterized by doctrines made famous by Canada’s 17th Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson. Learning from his experience as a diplomat, a career that won Lester Pearson aNobel Peace Prizefor helping create the first United Nations peacekeeping force and defusing the 1956 Suez Crisis, Canada developed a reputation of being ideal peacekeepers, peace-builders, and humanitarians – resulting in Canada’s self-perception of being a middle power.
Over the years, Canadian politicians and the general public havevigorously heldonto these Pearsonian ideals in their foreign policy to reinforce Canada’s international identity. For instance, by following through with its Pearsonian foreign policy, Canada won a non-permanent United Nations Security Council (UNSC) seatonce every decadeuntil 2010. A Pearsonian foreign policy also led to Canada becoming a pivotal internationalist in the rules-based order, using the system’s multilateralism to mobilize international consensus on pressing humanitarian issues. One of Canada’s lasting post-war achievements was theOttawa Treatythat banned anti-personnel mines.
The recent subpar showing by theHarper Conservative(2006-2015) andTrudeau Liberal(2015-2021) governments to not invest in its foreign policy, national security, and defence capabilities beyond the traditional Pearsonian middle power ideals have hampered Canada’s ability to respond to the shifting nature of global and regional geosecurity issues. Uniquely, rather than adapting to the geosecurity realities of a rapidly shifting geopolitical order, the past governments sought to cash in on Canada’s past Pearsonian middle power image and experience as a cheaper and more cost-effective tool to attain and advance its foreign policy and national security and defence interests.
In his recent European trip following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Justin Trudeauremarkedthat “the power we [Canada] have that we have built up over the past 75 years…means that we have the tools to damage the Putin regime far more effectively than we ever could with tanks and missiles.” These remarks also play into thestatementby Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly when she told a TV interviewer that Canada is “not a military power…and that the country was good at convening and making sure that diplomacy is happening.” Although Canada’s economic sanctions are instrumental in hindering Putin’s war machine, Russia is still undertaking offensive military operations in Ukraine.
Unlike its historical role in the World Wars and the post-war period, Canada is currently not recognized as a pivotal diplomatic partner. For instance, in the Indo-Pacific, Canada’s like-minded partnershave not sought outCanadian diplomatic engagement in new regional security and defence organizations, like the Quad and AUKUS. Moreover, Canada’s two consecutive failures to attain a non-permanent seat on the UNSC and its fiasco to uphold itspledgeof 600 peacekeepers for UN operations, including for a 200-member Quick Reaction Force (QRF), strengthen the inept of Canada’s ability to bridge and convene diplomacy and policy to geosecurity anxieties.
In the annual review of theCanadian Foreign Policy Journal, Canada’s foreign policy received a C grade average, with its diplomatic and defence policies obtaining a D+. Although there are traditional and logistical reasons for these poor marks, a noteworthy explanation can be attributed to Canadian politicians and bureaucrats unwillingly or deliberately lacking an understanding of hard power politics and its use in a rapidly aggressive-looking global order.
For many Canadians, the Pearsonian ideals echo a less realist attitude to the horrors of war and armed conflict that plagued the first and second halves of the 20th century. Instead, these ideals offered a more liberal and internationalist perspective in dealing with armed conflict that shouldered moredignified waysto conclude or prevent wars.
However, the overreliance on these ideals mitigates the unavoidable assistance that hard power politics offer when dealing with revisionist, antagonistic and revanchist powers that seek to use the inherent weakness of liberal-democratic middle and lower-tier powers that prefer megaphone diplomacy to robust force.
Despite the United States asking Canada to meet the two per cent of GDP spending on the military, Canada has been lackluster in physically meeting that commitment. Since World War II, only two Canadian prime ministers, Louis St. Laurent and Brain Mulroney, have spent two per cent of GDP on military infrastructure, assets, and capabilities. The Government of Canada’sBudget 2022has promised to boost defence spending by $8 billion over five years, increasing Canada’s military spending to 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2026-27. While this increase is welcomed across security and defence circles, the budget is still well off from its two per cent commitment, with Canada needing to spend anadditional $16 billionto achieve the latter.
It is odd that a middle power like Canada, which has three large geosecurity peripheries, alliance commitments, and a history of being a force amplifier, has a relatively delicate military posture and “firepower” – Canadaranking 21stfrom the top and one of thesmallest militariesin the G7. For Canada to avoid becoming the weak link in its collective security alliances and timid in its regional engagement strategies, Canada needs to embrace hard power politics as a viable tactic to attain and advance its national security, defence, and foreign policies. When thinking of hard power politics, Canada must not assume that it will compel a country to obey and give in to its interests. Instead, hard power politics must be heeded through a lens that ensures a country’s survival, prosperity, and stability through self-help initiatives that bring forward competitive technologies, economics, and military assets and capabilities to emphasize a state’s geosecurity posture with non-state actors, peer- and non-peer states.
Furthermore, it would be beneficial for Canada to observe hard power politics throughChase Freeman’sstructural notions of competitive relationships – rivalry, adversarial animosity, and enmity analogies – that characterize a state’s relationship with peer- and non-peer states. Chaseman argues thatrivalrypits states, or a party of actors, against each other in a competition to excel, often leading to the self-improvement of the involved powers.Adversarialanimosity, on the other hand, refers to zero-sum competitions that focus on one country, or geopolitical bloc, to gain strategic advantages over the other competitor. A competition that evolves aroundenmityposes the gravest threat to a state’s survival as competitors reject all notions of compromise and regard the strategic interests of adversaries as illegitimate.
Despite these relationships taking on bleak terms to associate state-to-state interactions, the latter’s candidness offers categorical levels that Canada, and its collective allies, can use in assessing the geopolitical landscape and evaluate the best tactics to ensure it attains and advances its unique security, defence, and foreign policies. For Canada, Chaseman’s analogy offers the most pragmatic way to capture the essence of being a multi-peripheral middle power by offering a near- to medium-termpas de troisoutlook that can be used to asses its geosecurity, geoeconomic and diplomatic status among allies, partners and opponents in a shifting global order that is noticeably multipolar.
On its transatlantic periphery, Canada must declare any forthcoming military deployments to NATO allies aslogistical and joint deterrence operationsinstead of humanitarian assistance. In these proclamations, Canada should directly identify Russia as the key security threat and indicate that the deployment of Canadian personnel and equipment is to amplify the defensive force of NATO. Canada should also be one of the first NATO allies to ratify the membership bids of Finland and Sweden and, upon their admission, should offer its military assets, capabilities, and infrastructure tomitigate any vulnerabilitiesto the Alliance’s new members and its new territorial jurisdiction. Lastly, Canada needs to continue its military procurement to ensure that its assets and capabilities maintain high interoperability with its allies. The recent announcement of Canadaselecting the F-35to replace its CF-18s is a promising step in the right direction.
In Canada’s high north, attention must move beyond thecalls for modernizing NORAD– a joint military organization between Canada and the US that provides aerospace warning, and air sovereignty, and protects the territorial integrity of North America. Building off its interests to update NORAD, Canada should invest in an Arctic navy consisting of patrol icebreaker vessels for the Canadian Coast Guard, anti-submarine frigates for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), and miniature unmanned maritime drones armed with surface and subsurface missiles. A Canadian Arctic Navy with these assets and capabilities, acting alongside NORAD, would be tasked to patrol the vast territory of Canada’s high north while also being equipped to deal with any maritime armed conflict arriving from the Arctic and Russia.
In the Indo-Pacific, Canada needs to strengthen its external relationships with regional middle powers, alongside its traditional partners. Specifically, Canada must approach prominent middle powers like Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand to establish a discreteIndo-Pacific middle power blocthrough multinational andminilateral organizations. These organizations should be formed around multiple2+2 dialoguesthat will bolster Canada’s military and diplomatic ties with the region’s middle powers and its geosecurity architecture. Lastly, Canada needs toinvest more substantiallyin the RCN by equipping it with modern naval weapons and operational systems that provide comprehensive offensive capabilities in all three areas of naval warfare – conventional, unconventional, and hybrid. It would also be strategically beneficial to launch an Indo-Pacific Command Center along the Canadian west coast.
Canada should also militarily reinforce its presence in the Indo-Pacific by heightening its hard power posture when undertaking multilateral missions. For instance, in conducting aerial logistics in support of Operations NEON, sponsored by the UN, China has been provocative in“buzzing”close to the Royal Canadian Airforce (RCAF) for no other foreseeable purpose than to be a disruptive and hawks actor. Although the Canadian government has indicated itsdispleasureagainst these Chinese actions through diplomatic channels, Canada should instead signal to China that it will double down on its commitment to Operation NEON by having RCAF fighter jets escort the slower CP140 Aurora surveillance planes during their missions, signaling that Canada’s military will not be bullied, harassed or intimidated in maintaining a rules-based order.
Canada needs to shed its last reminisce of its Pearsonian identity and set out a desire to achieve a competitive edge in international geopolitics, especially when it comes to geosecurity. Canadians should recall its history, recognizing that Canada fought its major wars in extra-regionaltheatres close to its geosecurity peripheries – World War I & II and Afghanistan in the transatlantic; the Korean War in the Pacific; and the Arctic during the Cold War.
As hard power politics becomes more pronounced in the international rules-based order, Canadians need to anticipate that future wars will extend outside Canada’s traditional geopolitical comforts and force Canada to project hard power politics in out-of-area theaters to defend its national interests and normative ideals.
Only by initiating a review and hard power reforms in its national security, defence, and foreign policies can Canada become more successful in deploying the Canadian Armed Forces and its diplomatic corps faster, efficiently, and pragmatically within and outside its geosecurity flanks, transforming Canada into a fortified power in a growing assertive world.","July 14, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-canada-strategic-dilemma-with-hard-power-politics/,Andrew Erskine,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
How Ukraine’s Resistance to Authoritarianism Could Inspire Taiwan: Perspectives from China and the USA,"On the 24th of February 2022,Ukrainewas invaded by Russia thereby escalatingthe Russia-Ukraine warwhich had started in 2014. Russian forces made swift gains in the south at first, with the primary goal of establishing a land corridor between Crimea, which it invaded in 2014, and territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.However, Russian advances werehampered greatlyby heavy resistance from Ukrainian forces around Mykolaiv in the west and Mariupol in the east.
The resistance taken by Ukraine against theRussia’s invasion has motivated the Taiwanese to take similar practical action against China in other to fight against threat to their democracy. These protests may indicate that citizens and governments in smaller democratic countries are willing to make sacrifices to protect their democratic state.
The Ukraine conflict was precipitated by the rivalry between theEUand Russia over Ukraine’s strategic geopolitical direction. The origins of the conflict can be traced back to the 2008 war between Russia (Moscow) andGeorgia, which effectively finished the possibility of Georgia and Ukraine joiningNATOand the start of a new monetary catastrophe, which appeared to lend credibility to local trade structures.
The EU and Moscow then arrived at opposing interpretations of the conflict. The Europeans sought to integrate Kyiv in Ukraine, together with five other former Soviet states, financially and socially with the Europe through the EU’s Eastern Initiative program, established in 2009. Instead of being a step towards potential EU expansion, this plan was an effort to create a region of safety to the east of the union’s boundary and strengthen such nations’ west inclination. The Russian State, for its side, attempted to convince Kyiv and the bulk of the former USSR States to embrace their main idea of a trading bloc, which was relaunched in 2009 and concluded in the adoption of a founding treaty called theEurasian Economic Union in May 2014.Instead ofre-creatingthe same USSR,as many in the West assumed, Moscow began building a Moscow society (a unique social phenomenon in Russia’s life) in Europe and Asia, which will provide the country with these financial benefits and, more importantly, greater negotiating power with its continental neighbors and friends, the EU to the West and China to the east.
To confront Russian forces stationed near Ukraine’s border and reassure NATO allies, US PresidentJoe Bidenauthorised roughly 3,000US troops to deploy to Poland and Romania(NATO nations bordering Ukraine) in early February 2022. Satellite images revealed Russia’s greatest force deployment near its border with Belarus since the end of the Cold War.
TheUnited States, Russia, and European nations, includingFranceandGermany, were unable to reach an agreement. While Russiaclaimedto have reduced the number of troops on the border of Ukraine, reports arose of a growing Russian force presence. The US has been a part of the Ukrainian conflict since the beginning. The United States was initially wary of the invasion as Russia, a nuclear-armed country with veto power in the United Nations Security Council, gathered more than 150 thousand troops along the Ukrainian border.
On February 24th, two days after huge convoys of Russian tanks moved across the border, US Secretary of State Antony Blinkenmaintainedthat the United States’ mission, backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid, was simply to support the Ukrainian people. The US imposed sanctions on Russia, initially targeting a few banks, oligarchs, political élites, government-owned firms, and Putin’s family, in an attempt to persuade Putin to withdraw his soldiers without resorting to military force.In early March President Biden stated that“Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is Word War III, something we must strive to prevent.”
The rising US involvement underscores larger fears among countries on or near Russia’s borders that Putin’s hostility will not end there. On April 22nd, a senior Russian military commanderstatedthat Moscow was seeking “complete control” of eastern and southern Ukraine, in part to allow Moldova, a small landlocked country that supports the European Union but relies on Russian energy, to enter the country.
China and Ukraine held a consistent relationship prior to the Russian invasion. China recognized Ukraine one year after it broke from the old Soviet Union.In 1992, China and Ukraine established formal diplomatic ties.China and Ukraine have had generally easy bilateral relations, especially since Ukraine’s entrance to the WTO in 2008, withcommerce centeredon the import and export of raw materials and a variety of civil and military goods.Since China announced the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Ukraine has been a viable partner and, as a result, the  Chinese government has also shown that Ukraine would be included in the initiative as an ally country.
Ukraine hoped for a good, long-term partnership with China, as well as the possibility of bilateral trade turning into a multi-dimensional relationship. Even though Ukrainian academics feel that collaborating with China will alienate the US and the EU, they remain open to and supportive of bilateral relations with China. Ukraine had great hopes for its relationship with China. During the Russia-Ukraine crisis, however, it appears that the Chinese government failed to meet such expectations.
The Chinese government has attempted to tread lightly, as it can be seen in their decision to abstain fromvotingin the United Nations Security Council draft resolution on ending the Ukrainian Crisis. It has not spoken out against Russia’s invasion. Despite its criticism of Western sanctions against Russia, China has not taken any steps to assist Russia in evading them, and it appears that it is attempting to avoid them. At the same time, what it says and does on the surface may not reflect what’s going on behind the scenes.
On the day of the Beijing Winter Olympics, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, revealing the face of the burgeoning China-Russia cooperation (at an event from which Russia was officially banned). Putin was greeted with enormous ceremony by the Chinese, who treated him with warmth and deference that no other leader has received. The encounter was lavishly covered by state-run media, featuring photographs of Xi and Putin conferring without masks.
Putin and Xi emphasised broad strategic bilateral cooperation in a joint statement, criticising Western nations’ Cold War mentality and asking for ahaltto NATO expansion. China has also pledged to increasing its natural gas purchases from Russia. On March 7, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated firmly that the situation in Ukraine had no bearing on China’s relations with Russia in a video press conference. He termed the China-Russia relationship “rock strong,” saying that “no matter how precarious the international situation becomes, China and Russia will retain their strategic focus and continuously advance our comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era.
The military of Ukraine could encourage countries likeTaiwanto fight Chinese territorial expansion in the future. In the face of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Ukrainians have been adamant about maintaining their national identity. The West’s assistance, as well as civic solidarity based on democratic ideals, helped them win the battle for Kyiv’s capital. The Russian troops and Putin were surprised by the unity among Ukrainians military and civilians.
Another small country, Taiwan, which lies roughly 100 miles off the coast of southeastern China may benefit the most from the resilience and unity shown by the Ukrainian military at the warfront. Taiwan has been threatened by invasion from its neighbor of more global political power and presence, China, which claims shaky authority over the self-governing island. The solidarity of Ukrainians has brought up a popular phrase on the Taiwanese social media:
“Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow!”.
Taiwan’s economy contributes more to global trade than Russia’s, but its military personnel cannot be compared toChina. Nevertheless,  just like Ukraine, it would have to rely greatly on public support from citizens and most especially the Taiwanese military long enough for the US or other major powers like the UK, France, and even the General Assembly of the United Nations to come to Taiwan’s aid.  President Tsai Ing-wen said,“The determination of Ukrainians has moved the world, making Taiwanese feel the same”. In October 2021 after Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu received a silver commemorative medal of the senate of the parliament of the Czech Republic, he told a news conference that“Despite great adversity, the government and people of Ukraine have been fighting with tremendous courage and determination.”He also went further stating“Let me say this from the bottom of my heart: You have been an inspiration to the Taiwanese people in facing threats and coercion from authoritarian power.”
China, on the other hand, has dismissed the connection between Taiwan and Ukraine, stating that Taiwan has always been part of China. Taiwan has responded, claiming that the island’s situation is fundamentally different, noting the natural barrier of the Taiwan Strait separating it from China, as well as Taiwan’s critical role in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Lin Wen-huang, the chief of Taiwan’s defence ministry’s joint operations department, declared in the last week of April that the island’s major annual military exercises, the Han Kuang, will explicitly“draw on the experience”of the Ukraine war in May and June.
Countries in Europe and Asia tend to recognize that countries like Ukraine and Taiwan need international backing in this geopolitical situation and this is evidenced by the speed with which the Biden administration engaged Asian allies like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and even Singapore to censure Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Their willingness to express worry about Ukraine shows that they believe they will need similar assistance from Europe in the future if China engages in a confrontation with one of them.
Perhaps it should be noted that as is it in Ukraine, the way Taiwan could maintain its sovereignty is if its people are willing to voice out no matter the circumstances and if the military is willing to fight no matter how bad the situation gets in the war zone. The Ukrainian military has continued to be an inspiration to small powers like Taiwan when it comes to contesting their territorial integrity.

EU Military Response: Uncharted Territory in the Union Foreign Policy,"As thewar came to the doorstep of Kyiv, theEuropean Unionand its allies were swift to react. While direct military support has been repeatedly discouraged to avoid further – drastic – escalations, the EU has taken other paramount measures which have fundamentally changed the direction of European foreign policy to support the defense ofUkraine. Indeed, as the war kept surging, European support did not waiver by providing lethal equipment to Kyiv and applying a series of sanctions and economic warfare techniques to damage the Russian offensive.
These measures represent the first crucial instance in which the EU engaged in these types of activities. As such, since the war began a little over two months ago, it is important to assess what the European response entails for the future of the Union, and what the repercussions could be both within Europe and towards its foreign relations.
The Union approving the funding and purchasing of lethal weapons from its own budget represent a historical precedent. Indeed, this is the first time that the Union directed its funds – over 450 million euros – towards supporting a country at war to provide military and humanitarian aid. These measures, supported by the European Parliament to“activate any EU budget instruments available”,demonstrate a sudden shift in the EU foreign policy so far, and it has accelerated the process of transformation of Brussels’s response to the external crisis.
Fundamentally, the consequences of this European response are twofold. Internally, this opens up a series of questions in regard to the European budget and action; underArt. 41 on the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union(TFEU), theEU budget cannot be used to finance military expenditurein regard to common foreign and security policies outside the EU. However, this is not absolute, asArt. 41(2)provides that such measures can be adapted in situations where the Council unanimously decides otherwise. Hence, to circumnavigate this in the context ofthe war in Ukraine, the Council adopted two decisions on assistance measures: decision(CFSP) 2022/338)for the supply of military equipment and support designed to deliver lethal force to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, anddecision (CFSP) 2022/339on the supply of non-lethal aid and humanitarian relief.
This support, to put it mildly,does not come cheap.Hence, the first question that stems is what the internal consequences of such measures are. While this deserves praise for the swift response of a system which is often condemned for being cluttered and cumbersome, what are the repercussions within the Union? If the Union were to have a unified military budget and response, what does that entail for the current provisions of the various Member States? Finally, given the severe costs that military budgets entail, and the fact thatthe EU budget can be meddled with only to a certain extent, does that entail anew system of internal taxationand perhapsunified debt,where each MS is called to support and participate to the European military expenditure, similarly to the federal system of the United States? These are just some of the questions that arise from this new situation, as the EU finds itself in a completely new uncharted territory.
What most hope for is that these questions will never need an answer and that the EU military expense remains aunicumwith Ukraine, an unprecedented effort in tragic situations which we as a global community shall hope to never arise again. However, should a similar situation repeat itself, then the EU could implement a system capable to address the new challenges which would automatically follow with it.
Nonetheless, while the internal consequences of such actions remain to be seen, what we can already assess is how these measuresfundamentally change the reality of the European foreign policy response.Indeed, this is the first time in the Union’s history that such a stance is taken in the context of a foreign conflict (as in, regarding third countries which are not part of the EU), and most notably in taken so openly the side of one. In the past, the Union has been aloof in its stance regarding conflict, and some have even criticized it for being slow and timid in its foreign policy approach. This system was in dire need of a change, and now, the war has accelerated the transformation of the EU geopolitical response.
Therefore, what this transformation is going to look like in the foreseeable future is yet uncertain. Indeed, this new European response seems to be founded on two pillars:focus on hard powerandlarge-scale sanctions.
For what concerns the latter, these are not exactly unprecedented for the Union, as the EU has reacted with small and target sanctions when facing foreign conflicts, such as inMyanmarorNicaragua.However, while that appeared to be more of a consequence of a wider geopolitical effort, with the sanctions on Russia the EU has spearheaded the efforts of economic warfare. Thus, this remains a stand-out instance of a fairly established practice at this point, which still however symbolizes a shift in paradigm in the way the EU confronts foreign conflicts.
The more interesting development instead, is found in the Union’snew focus on hard power. The Council approved on March 21sttheStrategic Compass:an ambitious plan for strengthening the EU’s security and defense policy. This entails a scheme to establish an EU rapid deployment contingent of up to 5000 troops from various MS, to “address common threats and challenges”. TheStrategic Compass also envisages a system to enhance defense expenditures across MSand strengthen the Defence system of the Union as a whole with its partners
The shift is, therefore, quite apparent. Whether this was ignited solely by the war in Ukraine, orthis was already in the works and was just accelerated by the conflict, it remains that the newfound European focus on hard power is unprecedented. At its very foundation, indeed, with theTreaty of Rome in 1958, it was spelled out how the aim of the Union was to promote peace and prosperity through economic interdependence and political convergence. Now, as the Union keeps evolving, the promotion of peace seems to be dependent on the need to establish a European military framework to conduct operations and increase spending.
While this new direction forEurope can offer some apparent benefits, chief amongst them is an ever-increasingconvergence between the Member Statesand sentiment of mutual dependence,this shift to hard power in response to foreign conflict does set a dangerous precedent. If the promotion of peace comes through the bearing of arms, then it is the Union’s duty that these new mechanisms remain in place only for extraordinary circumstances. Instead, what the Strategic Compass seemed to have ushered in,is a far wider and more complex mechanism for EU military action, which is taking the Union into a new chapter of its history.
Often, when the main geopolitical actors at play are discussed, we fail to recognize thatthese entities evolve too. In particular, when considering the European Union, is often considered a slow, cumbersome beast of bureaucracy where nothing actually changes. While that is true to an extent, at the same time we fail to recognize that the Union is still a young and evolving organization and has changed drastically since its inception in Rome.
Therefore, when assessing the new developments in relation to the war in Ukraine, it becomes clear how this situation could drastically change the Union’s future. It remains difficult to assess whether these changes will remain anunicumin the EU policies, or whetherthis represents the beginning of a new era for both internal EU budget and external foreign relations.Yet, these evolutions will inevitably transform the functioning of the European Union, and open the door for even further changes in the future.

[ANALYSIS] A Brief History of Rwanda: Understanding the UK-Rwanda Partnership Through a Historical Lens,"TheUK governmentannounced this summer a bilateral partnership withRwandain which people seeking asylum in the UK will no longer be able to, instead being extradited to Rwanda to await their asylum decisions, and then remaining in Rwanda thereafter if their asylum is accepted. While this policy proposal has received plentiful criticism in the UK, ranging from activists to legal challenges, this analysis will instead focus on Rwanda.
This analysis wishes to introduce a brief history of Rwanda, in the belief that knowledge about a state’s past helps to elucidate its present. It will conclude with an analysis of the UK-Rwanda partnership in this historical context asking whether this is a partnership that will really benefit Rwanda.
TheRepublic of Rwandais a small, densely-populated, land-locked country located in the Great Rift Valley where the African Great Lakes lie. Rwanda was an independent African kingdom well into the 19thcentury, and by this time was ruled bymwami(“king”) Rwabugiri who conducted decades of military expansion and consolidation, coming to control the majority of what is today recognized as Rwanda.
Rwanda, having been already claimed byGermanyduring the Scramble for Africa, was first invaded by Europeans in 1893, and then became Ruanda-Urundi in 1916 underBelgium. Whilst Germany had imposed a cash tax on Rwanda, Belgium introduced forced labor and commodity crops, mainly coffee, which was extremely unpopular. This led to a Rwandan diaspora of hundreds of thousands to the neighboring British Protectorate of Uganda, which did not have the same policies under the sub-imperialist Buganda administrators.
In 1931, with the rise of eugenics in Europe,Belgium claimed that Tutsis, a Rwandan ethnicity,had Caucasian ancestryandwere superior to Hutus, another Rwandan ethnicity to which the majority of Rwandans belonged. Tutsis had historically been the main ethnicity of the Rwandan aristocracy, and Hutus had made up the majority of the peasantry. The Belgians consolidated this categorization; they issued Rwandans with ethnic identity cards, undertook phrenological experiments, and claimed there were physical differences between the two ethnicities, and ‘church, school, administration and the army were organised around the assumed racial superiority of the Batutsi’ (the prefix ba- refers to a group of people) (Hintjens, 1999, p. 253).
After WWII, Ruanda-Urundi became aUN trust territory; whilst Belgium retained administrative authority, democratic reforms were made under the rulingmwamis.Pan-Africanismswept through Central Africa in the 1950s, inciting the 1959 Rwandan Revolution. In 1960, the Belgian government held municipal elections in Ruanda-Urundi, which the Hutu majority won, electing in Hutu representatives and ending the centuries-long Tutsi monarchy. The UN urged that the Belgian government divide the kingdom into the separate countries of Rwanda andBurundiand it became independent in 1961. Bordered by theDemocratic Republic of Congo,Uganda,Tanzania, andBurundi, the country has since had a tumultuous history, playing a poignant part in the formation of international norms around peacekeeping and UN intervention.
The Rwandan genocide occurred in 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War between the Hutu Rwandan Armed Forces, representing the government, and the rebelling Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. In Rwanda, ‘racialist ideologies mainly served as a mask or pseudo-justification for the more fundamental goal of regime survival under conditions of sharp socioeconomic crisis and growing political opposition’ (Hintjens, 1999, p. 242). At the height of the war, a plane carrying the Hutu President of Rwanda Juvenal Habyarimana, and the President of Burundi was shot down,igniting ethnic tensions across Rwanda and initiating the genocide of the Tutsi people: there were ‘as many as 1 million people dead in 100 days’ (Hintjens, 1999, p. 276).
After the genocide,the Great Lakes refugee crisis began. For the purposes of clarity, this analysis will quickly define the key concepts it will be handling (all definitions are sourced from the UNHCR). Firstly, an asylum seeker is someone whose request for sanctuary has yet to be processed; a refugee is a person who has fled war, violence, conflict, or persecution and has crossed an international border to find safety in another country; an internally displaced person is someone who is motivated by the same reasons as a refugee to move, but does not cross international borders; and a migrant is someone who has changed their country of usual residence, irrespective of the reason for their migration.
The Great Lakes Refugee crisis was described by Wilkinson as a ‘refugee exodus of biblical proportions’ (1997). More than 200,000 Rwandans crossed into Tanzania in 24 hours following the genocide, a small portion of the total 2,000,000 refugees that left Rwanda. The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, estimated at the time that ‘there were over two million refugees in neighbouring countries, including some 1.2 million in Zaire (now DRC), 580,000 in Tanzania, 270,000 in Burundi and 10,000 in Uganda’.
Significantly, one of the largest refugee camps in Zaire faced so many problems that the situation eventually led to the First Congo War. Summarised by a UNHCR Report:
‘The Zairean central government’s authority in eastern Zaire, far from the capital Kinshasa, was weak. The Rwandan génocidaires had allies in the local administration in the Kivus and ex-FAR officers established effective control of the camps. Relief workers were in no position to confront them. Tents at Goma were grouped by secteur, commune, sous-préfecture, and préfecture, in a mirror image of the administrative organization of the country the refugees had just left.’
The presence of armed Hutu groups (called the Interahamwe) in refugee camps, taking control of the one in Zaire, was a humanitarian disaster. Militarised refugee camps were not new but proved to be an issue that the UNHCR and host governments have continuously been unable to resolve. As such, Article II.6 of the 1969 Refugee Convention of the Organisation of African Unity states: ‘For reasons of security, countries of asylum shall, as far as possible, settle refugees at a reasonable distance from the frontier of their country of origin’. However today, this is, unfortunately, still not the case. The Second Congo War ended in 2000 when the final RPF troops left the Congo. Militias continued to cause violence and displacement until 2007 when the last militias were disarmed with a large-scale effort aided by the UN.
Rwanda today still bears the deep scars of the genocide. It has a dynamic population, with an average age of 19 and around 120,00 immigrants in 2021 as well as a large number of emigrants,108,000 in 2010 and 45,000 in 2017. Its economy suffered heavily after the genocide and the mass diaspora but has since strengthened, mostly relying on subsistence agriculture with the same cash crops introduced by Belgium: coffee and tea. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, but the reliance on agricultural products makes the economy vulnerable to price shifts. Contemporary governments discourage distinctions between the Bahutu, Batutsi, and Batwa ethnicities of Rwandans, and these categories are no longer included on identity cards or the census.
The current refugee crisis is of a complex, global nature. TheUNHCRreports that there were 82.4 million asylum seekers at the end of 2020, and according to IDMC director Alexandra Bilak, ‘2022 is looking bleak’ (UNHCR, 2022). 86% were hosted by developing countries, 73% were hosted by neighbouring countries and 68% originated from just five countries (Syria 6.7M, Venezuela 4M, Afghanistan 2.6M, Myanmar 1.1M, South Sudan 2.2M, Other 7.9M). Children accounted for 42% of the asylum seeker population, despite making up only 30% of the global population. Five countries hosted at least 1.2 million refugees: Turkey 3.7M, Colombia 1.7M, Pakistan 1.4M, Uganda 1.4M, Germany 1.2M. In the UK, as of mid-2021 there were 135,912 resident in the UK, and 83,489 pending asylum cases. Rwanda, similarly, is hosting 127,163 refugees as of September 2021. However, the population density of the UK is 281 people per Km2and its 2021 Q4 GDP was£564,812 millionwhereas Rwanda’s population density is 525 per Km2and its 2021 Q4 GDP was Frw 2,931 billion, translating to GDP£2,279,266.
The UK-Rwanda bilateral partnership was announced in the UK by aMemorandum of Understandingpublished on the government website. Its basic tenets are:
‘Faciliat[ing] cooperation between the Participants in order to contribute to the prevention and combating of illegally facilitated and unlawful cross border migration by establishing a bilateral asylum partnership in which Rwanda commits to receive asylum seekers from the UK, to consider their claims for asylum, giving effect to their rights under international law through the Rwanda domestic asylum system and arranging for the settlement in Rwanda of those recognised as refugees or otherwise requiring protection.’
There are, first of all, several logistical issues with this partnership. The UK has agreed to pay Rwanda GBP £120 million for ‘economic development and growth, and will pick up operational costs of the program, along with accommodation and integration expenses’ (Beirens et al., 2022), in effect subcontracting its border enforcement process. This is a large economic incentive for Rwanda, considering its GDP, and will be a boost to its hospitality industry, as documented bythe BBC.
However, in this article, there are a total of 102 rooms at the Hallmark residence in Kigali’s (Rwanda’s capital) Nyarugunga suburb. A further 30 furnished 3- and 4-bedroom bungalows are mentioned, complete with gates and gardens. There is one other hostel named, the Hope Hostel, that will accommodate asylum seekers. This really evidences the actual capacity of Rwanda to host the UK’s asylum seekers; analysts have estimated it has enough space for about 100 people at a time, and to process up to 500 people a year. In 2021, 28,526 asylum seekers entered the UK via boat over the English Channel.
Furthermore, Rwanda’s partnership is in conflict with the stance of the African Union (AU). Previously, the AU supported the construction of permanent structures for an Emergency Transit Mechanism in cooperation with the UNHCR to temporarily accommodate over 900 Libyan refugees, over half of which have now been relocated to Sweden, Canada, Norway, France and Belgium. However, when Denmark announced last year a highly similar deal to the UK’s, the AU labelled ‘such attempts to stem out migration from Africa to Europe xenophobic and completely unacceptable … it’s all about sending a deterrent to asylum seekers … anyone who is trying to flee repression in Africa is going to be horrified at being sent to Rwanda’ (Fleming, 2022).
In sum, Rwanda’s ability to accommodate and process the number of asylum seekers required by the UK is disputable. The sentiments of the AU echo many of the criticisms levelled by activists and legal bodies in the UK. It is difficult to see why the UK did not want to offer a tired-and-tested programme such as the Emergency Transit Mechanism if it feels its borders are that overwhelmed by the current rate of asylum seekers; in comparison to Germany’s 1.1M accommodated refugees, the UK’s numbers are minor. This certainly would have achieved the economic development partnership that the two parties desire. However, as the AU states, ‘it’s all about sending a deterrent’; the UK has a political motive in mind, and some asylum-seekers are seeing this partnership as ‘Priti Patel’s Fantasy’. As summarised by Bsmah:
‘If asylum seekers had a choice and were offered a legal route, they wouldn’t risk their lives taking a dangerous journey to seek safety. I can’t believe that the UK claims that it is at the forefront of human rights, promotes individual liberties and the rule of law and equality, yet has a brutal immigration system, and implements such an evil plan … The plan is discriminatory and racist at its core. It targets a particular age group and gender to deport to Rwanda. Even after they are granted refugee status, the UK will not receive them; like they are not worthy of living here … I don’t know when our sufferings will end. We, asylum seekers, are treated as a second class with no rights. Living years without basic rights such as the right to work is not easy. I believe the government’s primary goal is to make asylum seeker’s lives unbearable.’

How Botswana is An Exception to the ‘Resource Curse’,"In the developing economies ofAfrica, one of the most relevant economic generating platforms has been mining activities. According toThe Resource Curse: The Cases of Botswana and Zambia, “[i]n the 2007-2008 United Nations Human Development Report, the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa received, on average, 66% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the trade or export of primary products, such as mineral ores.” However, the need for resources such as minerals and oils has become a concern. There has been a correlation drawn between negative or slow economic growth and the countries that depend largely on natural resources. This correlation can be said to be the “resource curse.”
Botswanais seen to be a miracle country. This miracle is mainly from stable exports of diamonds and the good governance that the country has. One ofBotswana’s biggest relationships and the most beneficial one is the global diamond cartel, called theDe Beers. Botswana is the main diamond manufacturer in the world by carats worth and accounts for 66% ofDe Beers’output.
According to A. Iimi inDid Botswana Escape from the Resource Curse?, Gaborone dominates diamond production. In fact, the international diamond price is determined by the average export value per carat for diamonds from Botswana. For Botswana the interest forDe Beersis to keep their prices extreme and for the company to maintain them. One could say that Botswana has a monopoly within a monopoly, which haskept its revenue from diamonds high and stablerelative to the fluctuation of other hard-mineral prices.
From 1975 to 1995, the GDP of Botswana was driven by the stream of diamond revenues, averaging 9.3% per year. The country enjoyed a period of stable four-fold development in diamond rent from the early-1970s to the early-1990s. Gaborone has been able to keep a relationship with the international donor community because of its high revenue. Unlike most of the countries in the sub-Saharan part of Africa, Botswana did not need help from World Bank funding or IMF funding. The stability of the diamond demand made the revenues of Botswana stable.
The Kalahari Desert covering the utmost of Botswana is one of the natural obstacles. Botswana is considered semi-arid and has a high possibility of having a drought. Cattle-herding is an agricultural activity that is prone in areas such as these. Arable land in Botswana is less than 5% and land that is close to rain-fed crops is less than 5%. The Dutch disease effects are blamed as the mechanism that is strengthening the South African rand against the Botswana pula, this is after the diamond booms. This causes the agricultural products of Botswana to have less competitiveness.
These difficulties were tried to be overcome by the government through agricultural sectors and manufacturing. This is done through policy solutions that put into the first partisan theory of the resource curse – which is the administration of the resource rents.
One of the important explanations for the resource curse comes from the political hypothesis. This is concerned with the policies that were implemented to try to control resource rents. The policies of Botswana have earned the title of being a resource-dependent success story. The country is often portrayed as following relatively liberal economic policies and development strategiesThe Resource Curse: The Cases of Botswana and Zambia. One of the most successful policies of Botswana is the savings of foreign currency, mineral taxation policy, physical infrastructure, its policy of negotiation with external agents and the formation of private-public partnerships, investment in human capital, and the use of expatriate experts. Gaborone has established an enterprise that is state-owned, having been established after Botswana attained their independence. This enterprise was aimed at strengthening the agricultural sectors and manufacturing. These organizations were, however, met with mixed results. Botswana’s objectives for the usage of diamond rents were to advance its physical organization and human capital.
During 1966, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in the world and it had no schools, no roads, and no railways. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) government accepted and executed a series of growth plans concentrating on investment in infrastructure, health, and education. The education system in Botswana showed success in attaining high levels of primary school enrolment,  high levels of female enrolment in schools as well as high levels of adult learning. Development of the education system has been an objective of the government sinceliberation. Another aspect that shows Botswana’s successful rent was the government’s policy of savings – this was both in the aspect of foreign currency reserves. According toManaging development policy in Botswana: Implementing reforms for rapid change, Botswana kept substantial funds of foreign currency that was at 4.9 billion U.S. dollars during 1996.
Gaborone’s bureaucracy implemented a mineral policy, and this procedure has been very important to secure the mining development of the country as well as produce the following resource rents. A successful aspect of this policy is the mineral tax and the royalties. For diamond mining, 25% was from income tax and 10% was for royalty, another policy implemented by the government in order to secure its revenue sources and its resource rents was the policy of negotiating with foreign governments and MNCs.
The characteristics of the Weberian administration of Botswana was rational due to the meritocratic enrolment of the civil retainers and the expected, long-term career plunders.According to Von Soest inStagnation of a “Miracle”: Botswana’s Governance Record Revisited,“the presidents of Botswana have not used the cabinet as an instrument for their methodical establishment of personal favours.” What can be argued is that Botswana has a robust obligation to its values of service of bureaucracy.
It has been revealed that although the government is transforming resource excessiveness into the development of the economy, it has been shown that the overflow of natural resources does not mean that there will be growth in that particular country. Governance in a country determines how much natural resources can actually contribute to the economy and its development. Natural resources that are linked to high economic growth are usually aligned with good governance. This good governance includes high government effectiveness, powerful anti-corruption policies, good regulation and a strong public voice that has accountability. Powerful anticorruption policies and good regulation are one of the most vital aspects when it comes to resource management within developing countries, inclusive of Botswana.

"The New Right: Trump, Bolsonaro, Milei?","The new right seems to have a tendency that distinguishes it: extravagant “outsider” candidates, disruptive speeches against the left, and the fight against the political caste. This formula was effective forTrumpandBolsonaro, but can it also be effective forJavier Milei? The manual of the new right seems to be very clear: to echo thepersistentdissatisfactions of a noisy and influential electoral basethat is tired of that “caste” that we usually hear mentioned. Among its most successful cases, we find Trump and Bolsonaro, while Milei begins to follow in their footsteps in Argentina through characteristic disruptive speeches that distinguish this “new politics”.
Their words are similar and the fight against political elites unites them, being the “caste” the main enemy. To describe this, it is enough to analyze famous phrases of each of the figures above-mentioned: “We will make America great again” was the slogan popularized by Donald Trump duringhis presidential campaign; “Together we assume the mission of rescuing Brazil” declared the current president of Brazil when he was elected; and “We will rebuildArgentina” is a phrase that is already customary toMilei’sspeeches.
Each of these phrases has a common characteristic: the candidates seek to fight the system that is sinking their respective countries. It is worth mentioning that in each of the cases, the governments they seek to dismiss are those in power, and this aspect highlights their rejection of leftist ideologies inArgentinaandBraziland of the Democratic Party in theUnited States.
Each of these political figures seeks with their speeches to position themselves as “outsiders” and “anti-system.”  The real estate magnateDonald Trumpclaimed to be an enemy of the Washington establishment, the Brazilian president arrived with the excuse of “cleaning up” corruption in Brasilia, and Javier Milei,the brand-new presidential candidate for the Argentine elections of 2023, presents himself as an anti-“political caste” superhero.
The next aspect in common of the “new right” is found inthe rise and coming to power of the candidates.Although Bolsonaro was already a congressman many years ago, the rise to power of Trump and Milei was surprising and mainly mediatic. Both candidates endured criticism at the beginning of their careers, in some cases calling them “crazy” and assuming the huge differences by which they would lose the elections. Nevertheless, Trumpmanaged to reach the presidency in 2017and everything seems to show he is using the same techniquesto try to win the next election. For his part, Milei is already a national congressman and has generated a movement worth considering for the presidential elections of 2023.
Another similarity that we can observe between the candidates is thebase of followersthat each of them has. Each, in their own way, sought to entice young people from different economic classes who were distanced from politics and traditional candidates. For them, supporting these flamboyant new candidates is part of a cultural battle rather than a simple election. This added to the fact that bipartisanship generally does not leave room for an “outsider”. The candidateknewhow to bring to light the number of people fed up with the irregularities of the system and found in them his workhorse.
It is essential to mention that all these politicians constantlyemphasize their rejection of leftist policies, and in some cases, they even express themselves with hate speeches toward socialism or communism. Recently, Javier Milei highlighted that “my alignment with Trump and Bolsonaro is almost natural” and defined his space as grouping “all those who fight against socialism or communism”. In addition, it is customary to hear mockery or insults from these candidates towards socialism and many more towards communism since they are all standard-bearers of capitalism.
This new way of doing politics was successful for Trump and Bolsonaro, regardless of whether their governments were successful or not as they both managed to come to power. Now, time will tell if the same formula can work for Javier Milei, who has been growing daily because of the social and political unrest that Argentina is going through.
The Argentinian case does not seem to have a light at the end of the tunnel, for years there have been two parties fighting for power, neither of them managing to settle in it. People consider that for some time now politics has no longer been at the service of the people, but it has been a space for seeking personal benefit. With this excuse, Milei seeks to attract votes under the slogan:
“The caste is afraid”.
Understanding by “caste” a “group that forms a special class and tends to remain separated from others by race, religion, etc.” according to the Royal Spanish Academy,Milei repeats the term in all his speeches. This “caste”, according to the brand-new Argentinean presidential candidate, does not understand what democracy really is, that is to govern by serving the people, but it rather seeks to serve them without listening to their needs. An example of this is the monthly draw of the deputy’s salary that Milei receives, arguing that this money belongs to society.
Now, it is interesting to analyzeArgentinabecause it is a completely different case from the rest. A tremendous economic crisis, social unrest that increases with time, and a weariness towards the political “status quo” make Milei’s name stand out in newspapers. However, only time will tell if the Argentine people really find in Milei a serious candidate for the presidency. Although in the legislative elections the leader of “La Libertad Avanza” received many votes, enough to win a seat, in the presidential elections the vote is usually much more conservative, generally leaving no room for the “outsiders”.
Nonetheless, today Milei is areal threat to the strongest opposition party, “Juntos por el Cambio” since Milei´s voters usually come from this party. “Juntos por el Cambio” is the strongest opposition to the current government ofAlberto Fernandez, who belongs to the “Frente de Todos”, aligned with former presidentCristina Fernandez de Kirchner. The main figure of “Juntos por el Cambio” is the former presidentMauricio Macri, who has already tried some alliances with Javier Milei in the last months. In this sense, there emerge 3 main axes, namely the current government in mandate “Frente de Todos”, the main opposition “Juntos por el Cambio”, and the growing figure of “La Libertad Avanza” led by Javier Milei.
There is still a little more than a year to go before the Argentine presidential elections and the panorama is currently unfinished. There will be a tug-of-war on the part of the opposition to reach a consensus and be able to compete jointly against the ruling party. This will be interesting since Javier Milei and his followers consider the current opposition as something very similar to the ruling party, grouping all of them as “socialists”.

The Newest U.S. Strategy to Tame Inflation,"At the beginning of February 2022, data showcased thatinflationin theUnited Statesreached 7.5%. This historic record could be somewhat softened if food and gas prices were not taken into consideration. In this case, what is commonly known ascore inflationwould be reduced to 6%. But these are not the only numbers the US Government – and its population – have shown concern for. When looking deeper, we can see that the price for women’s attire rose 11%, as did bacon (18%) and 41% for used cars and trucks. To round it all up,gas prices increased by 40%. A matter that would not be improved by the tense relations between Washington and Moscow.
Amidst all this uncertainty,President Bidendeveloped a plan to tackle inflation and bring back afloat the US economy after the subsequent blows it has taken since theCovid-19 health crisis.
On May 10th, 2022 the White House released apress statementoutlining the main points of President Biden’s new plan to control inflation. Some of the main areas covered were healthcare, gas, childcare, and consumer goods. On top of that, the core democrat belief that the rich should pay more is woven within the whole document, meaning that in every step where taxes are mentioned, an increase in the taxation of the top incomes in the country is also brought up.
One the one hand, concerning fuel,the aim will be to reduce the peak in gas prices– a consequence of theRussian military offense in Ukraine. To do so, 1 million barrels of oil will be made available every day and ally countries will be urged to release an additional 60 million. This measure hopes to lower the dependence on Russian fuel. Additionally, companies that are sitting on excess production must have topay a feeif they wish to continue storing this idle product. This will also be paired with the lowering of energy bills and working towards energy independence in the long term.
On the other hand, there will be areduction in the price of everyday items, such as prescription drugs and food, as well as childcare and housing. This measure will come both as direct action and as a consequence of improving supply chains and manufacturing. Lastly, large corporations and the wealthiest families in the country will see an increase in taxation to reduce the federal budgetdeficit.
Since the economic situation of the US has a tendency to create a ripple effect that reflects on the rest of the world economies, it is foreseeable that other central banks – like the European Central Bank (ECB) – will take action after the Federal Reserve announced a higher rate in loans. Whether the US interest rate is higher than expected by the market, will determine if it firms up against the rubble. Should this be the case, the Russian Central Bank will keep supporting its currency and the mid-term position of the rubble will then depend on future political decisions from both US and Russian administrations.
Starting with the Labour Market, in general terms, salaries have been increasing. However, not at the same pace or volume as prices. There are a few exceptions to this rule which include the 10% raise on hotel staff wages and 7% for bar and restaurant servers.
These ups and downs in salaries, together with the unpredictable price risings, havetaken a toll on the North American consumption strategy. It has been reported in several surveys that 80% of consumers will change their approach to spending and shopping should the situation persist. These behavioral changes may touch on -although not exclusively- buying fewer items, prioritizing large chains with a marketing strategy based on low prices (e.g. Walmart), waiting and scouting deals, and reducing the money spent on gift seasons like Christmas or Valentines Day.
It seems clear that the global scale economy that interconnects global citizens all portrays inflation as an issue that must be dealt with by uniting strengths and coordinating efforts. Only time and the proper management of the situation will tell whether the strategy was appropriate, or only fruitful on paper.

The Agonizing Prison System in Ecuador,"The past three years have been catastrophic for the Ecuadorian prison system. Multiple massacres marked new records for inmates’ deaths in the country’s history. ThePenitenciaria del Litoralfacility witnessedthe killings of more than 200 prisoners between February and November 2021. These events were especially concerning because of the methods used, which have guided multiple theories regarding what motivated the massacres.
However,these are by no means isolated incidents. Violence inside correctional institutions in the country has been occurring since their conception. The reality inside these facilities can be attributed to many factors, including issues in and outside the prison and the State’s role. In fact, the recent spike in altercations is only an additional visible sign of an agonizing system.
Certainly, the recent massacrescaught people’s attentiondue to theirsadistic natureand themedia coverage they received. This led to the development of hypotheses, some better founded than others, that sought to explain the rise in violence. For the government, the crisis is a consequence of the changing power dynamics between criminal gangs as they struggle to find a new “mega-leader” after the death ofLos Choneros’ringleader in 2020. Others argue the massacres are a reflection of the out-of-prison dynamics between drug trafficking gangs. Some have even argued they were part of satanic rituals. Nevertheless, none of these suppositions can, by themselves, explain the issue in its full magnitude.
It is evident that the State’s actions, or lack thereof, have been a contributing factor of major importance. In fact, the Committee Against Torture’s (CAT) most recent observations highlight the many shortcomings in the correctional system. It also calls attention to areas in which the State’s intervention has been deficient. Among other factors, some of the most concerning aspects of the report revolve around living conditions, interactions with visitors, and corruption.
In fact,the CAT in its List of Issuesalready required the State to explain its policies regarding prisonoverpopulation, inmates’ access to healthcare, the frequency ofviolent altercations, and the number ofdeaths in custody. According to the inquiry, inmates live in constantly deteriorating conditions with limited access to appropriate medication, healthcare, and personal space. Other reports highlight the terrible quality of food and the very limited access to social rehabilitation services.
In addition, civil society organizations have raised their concerns regarding thebarriers established for communication between inmates and their families. For starters, the right to maintain communication and have visitors seems to be more of a privilege in reality. Issues such as the remote location and the ever-changing conditions to enter the facilities as visitors, serve as a deterrent; especially for family members who live in poverty. In fact, stories from those who make it inside include testimonies of having to pay for getting someone to watch their belongings, transport them and even enter the prisons. Many have also been subjected to humiliating and invasive searches, including strip searches for women in front of other individuals and even their own children.
The most common practice of all is charging visitors or inmates for “turning a blind eye” when forbidden items, such as weapons, drugs, and cellphones, enter the facilities. That is why not even full-body scans have been able to restrict the entrance of prohibited objects. Indeed, in 2014,more than 100 prison guards were sanctioned administratively for engaging in illegal activities. However, it is unclear whether these were proportional to their actions and would effectively deter them from relapsing.
Considering all these factors, it is evident that the State’s policies, reforms, and decisions have been a catalyst for prison violence in Ecuador. Nonetheless, one must not forget that the issue of prison violence does not respond to a unique cause. Rather, it is a combination of factors that have, and continue to, force the system to its breaking point.
It is no secret thatEcuador has seen a change in the dynamics inside prison facilities in the past ten years. Some might say it is the harsh living conditions that drive people to crime. Others might blame it on the changes to the judicial system and the typification of unlawful activities. Either way, it is of the utmost importance to understand the evolving role that Ecuador’s geographic, and other conditions, play in the internationally organized business of drug trafficking.
In fact, the country has moved on from being considered only atransport location to playing an active role in international drug trafficking.Indeed, activities such as consumption, production, and money laundering, have permeated the country and allowed illegal funds and gang ring leaders and members to be dangerously involved in judicial proceedings, political campaign funding, and other political and economic activities. It is evident that the more power drug trafficking, and its consequences, have in Ecuador have affected not only the everyday life of citizens but also the reality inside correctional facilities, which are nothing else but a representation of what goes on outside them.

[ANALYSIS] Trouble in the Stars: Future of Outer Space Security,"Since ancient times, mankind has been fascinated with what is beyond Earth. Humans have an innate curiosity to explore the unknown, chart the uncharted and push beyond spatial limits. From stargazing to building the first telescope to launching Sputnik I, our tryst with space has evolved through the centuries. Since the beginning of the modern space age in the early 20thcentury, missile science and space technology have undergone massive changes. In a rapidly digitizing and globalizing world, humankind relies on outer space for various services, ranging from communication and navigation to disaster mitigation, weather forecasting, remote sensing and monitoring climate change.
As space-based assets and data continue to play a crucial role in civilian life and military activity, outer space is becoming an increasingly critical domain for peace and security. Various states are developing advanced counter-space technologies like anti-satellite weapon tests (ASAT) which threaten to destabilize strategic stability in outer space and trigger the weaponization of space. Although many efforts have been made by the UN to maintain outer space for peaceful purposes, there remains a gap in political willingness and effective implementation.
Swashbuckling military action, cybernetics, carbonite freezing, and alluring tractor beams take us to the mystical world of Star Wars. Even though such imageries are limited to popular culture references, sometimes fiction and reality merge in an ill-fated way. The launch of Sputnik I by the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1957 and the existing Cold War competition triggered a space race between the US and USSR and, throughout the 1970s and 80s, the two major space powers were involved in testing nuclear weapons in space and building offensive capabilities.Thisremark by the then US Secretary of State Dean Rusk aptly illustrates the insecurity regarding space weaponization, “There is an increasing danger that space may become man’s newest battlefield.”
In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which was dubbed “Star Wars.” The actor-turned-President envisioned a kind of military warfare wherein space-based lasers could shoot down missiles. Though no country is nowhere near such technological advancement, the idea that outer space can be used as a war-fighting domain was well planted in the minds of all nations.
The launch of the first ASAT weapon by the Soviet Union in 1968 was another turning point in the history of space weaponization. Large scale ASAT tests were conducted by the USA and USSR in the 1960s. The United States conducted its first ASAT weapon test in 1985 and other emerging space powers, like China and India, followed suit. In January 2007, Chinasuccessfully conductedan ASAT missile test and destroyed its ageing weather satellite. In 2019, India also successfully tested an ASAT underMission Shakti.
Joseph W. Ashy, former U.S. commander-in-chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command,famously said, “We’re going to fight in space. We’re going to fight from space and we’re going to fight into space.” It has been more than seven decades since space has been used for military activities. From trials of ballistic missiles to nuclear explosive tests to the development of anti-satellite systems (ASAT), the domain of space has undergone massive militarization. But the colossal change in the scale of development of offensive counterspace capabilities is perturbing.
Counterspace capabilitiesrefer to techniques used to gain space superiority, these capabilities include direct ascent, co-orbital, directed energy, electronic warfare and cyber weapons. Countries such as the USA, Russia and China haveconducted testsof technologies for rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) in both low earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit – thereby possessing co-orbital ASAT capabilities. Jamming of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals and satellite communications is another area in which countries likeIranand North Korea are developing disruptive technologies.
In November 2021, the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces conducted an ASAT test as part of itsFederal Space Programmewhich sparked concerns as it created more than 1500 pieces of space debris,accordingto the US Space Command. Though the USA conducted its last ASAT test in 2008, it continues to develop advanced counterspace technologies. As outer space continues to become an increasinglycongested and contested domain, there is an urgent need to ramp up space security dialogues and establish frameworks for peaceful use of space, a global common for all of humanity.
In 1958, the Ad Hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space was established by the UNGA in itsresolution1348 (XIII)of 13 December 1958. Later in its resolution1472 A (XIV)of 1959 this expert unitbecamea fully functioning, permanently established Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPOUS) under the Office for Outer Space Affairs within the Department for Political Affairs in the UN. Regarded as the topmost forum for the development of international space law, COPOUS has concludedfiveinternational treaties on space-related activities.
The Treaty onPrinciples Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, commonly known as theOuter Space Treaty, came into force in 1967. Providing a basic framework for international space law,Article 4of the Outer Space Treaty prohibits placement “in orbit around the Earth [of] any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install[ation of] such weapons on celestial bodies, or station[ing of] such weapons in outer space in any other manner.” It also states that “outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all States” for ‘peaceful purposes.’ Though this treaty provides a substantive framework for space law, it still remains quite vague.
Other treaties include theRescue Agreement(1968),Liability Convention(1972),Registration Convention(1976) and theMoon Agreement(1984). These treaties deal with issues such as access to space for all nations, freedom of exploration, rescue and return of astronauts and registration of objects launched into outer space.
Various other disarmament measures have been underway, including the proposedPrevention of An Arms Race in SpaceTreaty(PAROS), which is currently being discussed in the Conference on Disarmament (CD); theTreaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects(PPWT), jointly proposed by Russia and China in 2008;ResolutionA/RES/75/36on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors; the proposed “Draft International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities” (ICoC) by the European Union (EU); the Guidelines for the Sustainability of Outer Space Activities; the Further Practical Measures for the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space; and the Establishment of Group of Governmental Experts on Transparency and Confidence-building Measures in Outer Space Activities (A/68/189) are some of the few endeavors.
The UN has worked extensively to synergize international co-operation in space related activities through various mechanisms including international and regional treaties, agreements, regulations and establishing guidelines for co-operative mechanisms. However, these initiatives are still non-binding and a lot of loopholes exist in the legal fine print.
Even after the decade-long existence of international law governing the use of outer space, we see an increasing trend towards outer space weaponization. Owing to an ambiguous space law, states have had considerable freedom in deploying weapons in outer space.
Though the OST clearly mentions that outer space shall be used for ‘peaceful purposes,’ states have differing interpretations for the same.  According to the ‘non-military’ theory, which is followed by Russia, ‘peaceful’ equates to non-military use. This interpretation has also been used in the 1959Antarctic Treaty. However, the US adheres to the ‘non-aggressive’ approach, as per the UN Charter. Under this approach, all military activities are lawful as long as they are non-aggressive.
Anotherarea of contentionis which kind of weapons can be placed in space. The OST only mentions the prohibition of placement of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. So, does this mean that all other kinds of weapons can be placed in space? As most of the space assets have a dual nature, that is, they can be used for both civilian and military use, it becomes difficult to ascertain the intention for use.  Also, the OST does not clearly define how international law will be applied to outer space. Definitions of terms such as ‘use of force,’ ‘threat of use of force,’ ‘weapon’ and even the boundaries of outer space remain undefined.
The disarmament measures undertaken under the aegis of the UN demonstrate that states recognize the need for outer space security and are willing to create co-operative security arrangements.The Manual on International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space(MILAMOS) is one such project which aims to clarify existing international law applicable to military uses of outer space peacetime. Moreover, in response to the November 2021 ASAT tests by Russia, the United States declared on April 18, 2022 that it is committed toend ASAT testingand called for global support.
As the realm of activity in outer space expands, it is imperative that an agreement on a framework for governing outer space is reached. The legal and semantic shortcomings of the existing treaties must be resolved. Additionally, the entry of commercial actors into outer space calls for reassessing, reframing and restructuring engagement and enforcement mechanisms. Countries must follow the norms of responsible behavior and be transparent about their goals. This will increase predictability and transparency in negotiations and eliminate mutual trust deficit.","November 16, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-trouble-in-the-stars-future-of-outer-space-security/,Riya Shah,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Are Economic Sanctions Effective To Stop North Korea’s Nuclear Activity?,"TheDemocratic People’s Republic of Koreais one of the most isolated states in the world due to its totalitarian regime led by Kim Jong-Un. Besides this, North Korea is internationallynotorious for its nuclear activity. After the first nuclear test made by the North Korean regime on the 9th of October 2006, not only did the United Nations start to punish the DPRK through multilateral sanctions but also the United States imposed its own unilateral sanctions against the regime. Many resolutions have been drafted by the United Nations in order to stop North Korea from testing nuclear weapons.
However, despite the numerous resolutions drafted and the consequent sanctions, the DPRK has not ceased its nuclear activity. Much debate has been done on whether sanctions, in this case, are useful, and whether anything could be done to make them more effective.
Economic sanctions are generally implemented by external governments to change the behavior of another country, usually in order to reach the desired objective.However, despite the clear aim, there is widespread knowledge of their ineffectiveness. In fact,sanctions rarely succeed in producing the desired change in that particular state.All these observations can be seen in the case of North Korea: in spite of all the sanctions received, the desired effect on the DPRK such as the stopping of all nuclear activity has not been yet achieved.
The United Nations Security Council has passed numerous resolutions and therefore enforced dozens of sanctions.However, none of these have been able to stop North Korea’s nuclear proliferation. The reasons behind this reality are many and by looking at the general framework of these resolutions, they all seem to lack strong measures for enforcement.
To begin with, this stems from a gap between the written text of the sanctions themselves and the actual enforcement that these must have in order to have an impact on North Korea. This cannot only be seen in Resolution 2094 but also in the first resolutions RES/1718 of 2006 and RES/2321 of 2016. The rhetorical devices used in these resolutions in particular, such as ‘calls upon’, ‘decides’, and ‘requests’, are clear examples ofweak uses of languagethat are unable to achieve their objective. This shows a clear fault in the way in which the UN has been focusing on the North Korean nuclear issue, and that in order for sanctions to be more effective, harsher wording that actively tackles the issue and sets up penalties for states that do not abide by its rulings must be used.
Besides an enforcement issue that lies within the written text of the resolution, it is also true that despite the United Nations Charter’s obligations to implement and enforce the Security Council resolutions stated inArticle 25, these are undermined by the fact that ultimately, it depends on the states whether or not they commit to the obligations made by the Security Council“in lieu of the UNSC’s incapacity to enforce its resolutions as a sovereign entity in its own right”. From this, it can be conjectured that the sanctions made by the United Nations Security Council present the opportunity to not comply with them. Therefore, in order for sanctions to be more effective, the UN would have to have a more assured method of enforcing them, rather than just relying upon the cooperation of all member states.
Also, while it can be observedthat the United States is the current world hegemon,it can be said that it has an alarming lack of political influence in Pyongyang. It is obvious that the United States could see that North Korean isolationism is the key to solving the nuclear issue. However, it could be argued that it is this isolationism that limits American influence in the regime and protects it from the worst effects of international sanctions. In fact,U.S. trade is so minimal that its sanctions alone would not have any impact on North Korea at all.This is why the United States has pushed for UN multilateral sanctions through the UNSC. However, due to the relative absence of western presence in the North Korean economy, these actions cannot be said to have had any serious economic impacts as of yet.
Moreover, American sanctions against North Korea cannot be effective in changing its nuclear habits due to China’s key place in dealing with North Korea. Due to the aforementioned lack of American influence on North Korean economics and politics,China has been repeatedly called into any debate regarding North Korean sovereignty, security, and nuclear actions.This situation prevents North Korean sanctions from being effective because China has been seen to shirk its responsibilities in the international sanctions it votes for, and toactively water down western sanctions.The fact that this situation improves China’s standing as it gains diplomatic importance through being the key player in such a vital issue in global security, incentivizes China’s dragging out of the process in order to continue to extract further gains in the future.

Therefore,Chinawould continue to ensure that North Korea hasenough trade to functionso that it can maintain the status quo and retain its diplomatic importance. While it can be said that China has shown increasing willingness to impose sanctions on North Korea since 2006, initially these sanctions were meaningless to the North Korean economy as China can be described as only half-heartedly following sanctions, and where they were imposed, they were imposed loosely and vaguely.
It has been argued that China does this because it profits massively from a monopoly on North Korean trade thanks to the geopolitical tumult that North Korean nuclear testing has caused. In fact, even when China did take a more proactive stance on North Korean trade sanctions in 2013, the trade turnover with North Korea made arecord growth of 7.8%, and Chinese trade, worth $6.5 billion, constituted 89.1% of North Korea’s total trade of that year. In this way, it can be said that sanctions have also been ineffective in dealing with the nuclear threat in North Korea due to China’s relatively lax attitude regarding North Korean imports as the Chinese government profits too much from near-exclusive access to Pyongyang’s markets.

China’s Push Into the Indian Ocean: How Can the United States Contain Its Growing Reach?,"In international affairs, the Indian Ocean is increasingly emerging as a major pole of great power competition. Home to some two billion people, this vast geographical region, stretching from the Malacca Strait and the western coast ofAustraliain the East to the Mozambique Channel in the West, has seen thePeople’s Republic of Chinaexpand its geo-strategic weight over recent years under the leadership ofXi Jinping.
This growing dynamic has raised great concern among theUnited States’ regional partners about the extent to which small states in the Indian Ocean will be able to mitigate the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) coercive diplomacy and maritime power ambitions.
Thegeo-strategic and economic importance of the Indian Oceanshould not be underestimated. It is the third largest body of water in the world and covers one-fifth of the world’s total ocean area. Furthermore, it is an important conduit for international commerce with about 40 percent of the world’s oil supply traveling through its entryways, including the Straits of Malacca, Hormuz, and Bab-el-Mandeb. The Ocean’s coastal countries are also a valuable source of uranium, gold, and diamond reserves.
China’s entry into the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), through economic investments and political engagement, is significantly reshaping regional dynamics.Chinahas specifically sought to enhance its geo-economic influence over developing countries through its multi-billion dollar development and investment program: theBelt and Road Initiative(BRI). As China’s BRI projects in the Indian Ocean gather pace, there is a growing concern that the CCP will inevitably seek to protect the security of its large-scale overseas investment projects and its citizens through military might.
“The pursuit of economic development is no longer Beijing’s primary goal. To become stronger, China is attempting to assert its Great Power status and transform its accumulated economic power into regional and global influence.”
To this end, the CCP has been pursuing increased acquisition of strategically located deepwater ports that can be used for commercial and military purposes. It appears that there is an urgent need for theBiden administrationto take concrete steps to safeguard the rules-based maritime order. If left unchecked, the Chinese militarymay intimidate states militarily and economically, similar to what it has done in the South China Sea for years.
China’s efforts tobuild poles of influence along the East African coasthave become increasingly discernible. This has been particularly evident in Djibouti, located at the mouth of the Red Sea, on energy transit routes. Over recent years, China has transformed its$15 billion commercial reachinto strategic gain, with the construction of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) first overseas naval base, directly adjacent to the multi-purpose Doraleh port. Most interestingly, the PLAN base is only 12 kilometres from Camp Lemonnier, home to more than4,000 US troops. This vantage point provides the PLAN access to the terminal berths, overlooking the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, through which an estimated12.5 to 20 per centof the world’s trade passes each year.
Beyond the Horn of Africa,China is also heavily involved in the coastal regions ofKenya. This is noticeable on Lamu Island, only 241 kilometres from Mombasa, where China’s state-ownedChina Communications Construction Companyhas embarked on building a second commercial seaport for the Kenyan government, which will include 32 berths. With Chinese companies controlling approximately70 percentof Kenya’s infrastructure projects, China’s growing influence may lead the CCP to exert political leverage to protect its investments, with large Chinese military vessels docking in the near future.
Projecting power across South Asia is also a key strategic imperative for the CCP. In advancing this position, President Xi hopes to alleviate the ‘Malacca Dilemma’ –China’s fear of a maritime blockade in the Malacca Strait by the US Navy– through which much of China’s international trade currently passes. The CCP is particularly interested in transformingthe deepwater port of Gwadarinto a full-fledged military outpost of the PLAN and integrating the terminal into its multi-billion dollarChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Across the countries of the Bay of Bengal, Chinese state-owned enterprises have ploughed huge funds to develop theKyaukphyu portand theColombo Eastern Container Terminal. In seeking to secure its economic interests, the CCP hopes also to establishmilitary logistics facilitiesin both Myanmar and Sri Lanka, which would greatly enhance the protection of its shipping lines in the Indian Ocean.
China’s growing footprint and influence in the IOR requires like-minded partners to place greater emphasis on multilateral security cooperation. Chinese commercial investments and military ambitions have been of particular concern within Indian foreign policy circles. India sits at the heart of the Indian Ocean: it has 7,500 kilometres of coastline and depends on the expanse for its trade and energy sources –95 per cent of Indian trade by volumeand68 per cent by valuepasses through the Ocean.
Against this backdrop, New Delhi has no desire to see Beijing meddle in the Indian Ocean and build its economic and strategic clout. With American and Indian security interests aligning like never before in the Indo-Pacific, both nations have sought to advance maritime interoperability with like-minded democratic countries of theQuadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad:AustraliaandJapan.
The Indian and U.S. Navies notably advancedMalabar exercisesin the Bay of Bengal with the Royal Australian Navy and the Japanese Navy last year; the 26th edition is scheduled to take place again later this year, most likely in October. Expanding and deepening cooperation on freedom of navigation outside the strict Quad security agenda in the Indo-Pacific region should also be considered. France, which holds a series of dependencies in the Indian Ocean, most notably Mayotte and Reunion, organized in April 2021 the La Pérouse exercises in the Bay of Bengal with Quad members. With Australia desperately eager to repair and reset Franco-Australian relations following Scott Morrison’sunceremonious terminationof a submarine program with France, the opportunity exists for the Quad to strengthen intelligence sharing and maritime cooperation with a like-minded partner across the East Indian Ocean (EIO).
By contrast, in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) no such political-security arrangement exists to date, bringing together countries with similar interests and threat perceptions. This is crucial, as theIndian Navyhas revealed that at any given time, six to eight Chinese warships are operating from the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. With geopolitical shifts sweeping the WIO, it appears to be imperative that US policymakers forge a new security alliance to safeguard the international rules and norms of the maritime space. Bringing together like-minded partners with interests in the region, such asIndia,Israel, and theUnited Arab Emirates(UAE), can seemingly go a long way towards achieving this strategic goal.
China’s mounting economic reach in the IOR calls for the Biden administration to step up its economic diplomacy. It requires Washington to pay attention to the demands of developing countries. The region’s low and middle-income countries are urging adequate infrastructure and connectivity projects instead of lopsided Chinese investment and aggressive influence over their political and economic institutions.
Some developing countries, most notably Sri Lanka, have incurredunsustainable debtsas a result of Chinese infrastructure financing deals, resulting in aloss of sovereigntyoverstrategic assets. In Kenya, the$4.7 billion Standard Gauge Railwaybuilt by the China Road & Bridge Corporation, has never made a profit in its four years of operation, putting the Kenyatta government athigh riskof debt distress. These debt sustainability problems have consequently provoked countries in the IOR, particularly Bangladesh, to bemore cautiousabout Chinese BRI projects.
Addressing the economic development needs of the region’s poorest countries requires Washington to boost American infrastructure investments. The Biden administration recently launched international economic projects such asBuild Back Better World(B3W) and theIndo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity(IFEFP), which can play a critical role in this regard in expanding trade and investments across the maritime zone. Developing a sustainable supply of bankable ventures will require Washington to increase public sector investments in research and development (R&D). This is crucial considering that since the turn of the millennium, China’s R&D spending hasincreasedby an average of 18 percent annually – while current American federal research funding is at itslowest levelin about 60 years. Public funding should equally be targeted to critical areas such as AI, quantum computing, and next-generation telecommunications.
The US is now called to then support the commercialization of these advanced technologies and step up its commercial diplomacy with developing countries, clearly communicating the long-term benefits of partnering with US companies: product quality, financial viability, and environmental impact assessment. In doing so, it can offer developing countries a credible alternative to Chinese technologies and investments.

LGBTQ+ Persecution in Nigeria,"LGBTQ+ individualsface numerous challenges all over the world, however, it must be said that these challenges are more acute inNigeria. While other countries on the continent, such as Cape Verde andSouth Africa, have taken steps towards the inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community, Nigeria has done the opposite.
One key example of this is the passing of theSame-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act(SSMPA) in 2013, which prohibits LGBTQ+ individuals from marrying andactively allows for the persecution of homosexuals. In response to the act,UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said
“rarely have I seen a piece of legislation that in so few paragraphs directly violates so many basic, universal human rights. Rights to privacy and non-discrimination, rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, rights to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention: this law undermines all of them.”
According to the act, partaking in a same-sex marriage is punishable by 14 years in prison; 10 years for being an LGBTQ+ ally, going to a gay club, or showing public displays of affection. In the country’s twelve Northern states, the situation is even direr. Under Sharia law,LGBTQ+ individuals are stoned, lashed to death, or forced to undergo terrible conversion therapy procedures such as genital mutilation and flogging.
In the Northern state of Bauchi, immediately following the initiation of the SSMPA in 2014,police hunted down 168 men for being suspected homosexuals. Of these, 38 were caught, beaten, and tortured. Later that year, in Bauchi, when a further eleven were brought before a Sharia court for belonging to pro-LGBTQ+ organizations, the court proceedings had to be postponed as the court was being pelted with stones by a mob numbering in the thousands demanding death sentences. In January 2015, 12 men in Kano city were detained by the religious police for allegedly planning a same-sex marriage ceremony.According to Aminu Daurawa, head of the religious police, these men were suspected as they “looked and acted feminine”.
In the South,the situation does not change much. The SSMPA is being used as a means for police officers to detain, torture, and extort suspects. For instance, in August 2018, 57 men were arrested in a hotel in Lagos for being“initiated into a gay organization”. They were each charged 200,000 Naira (£389) for bail. Furthermore, the law has been used to protect those who would harm LGBTQ+ individuals.In Geshiri in February 2014, a mob of 40 dragged sleeping “suspected gay men” from their beds and beat them “with sticks spiked with nails, wires, whips, and broken furniture. Members of the mob were shouting that they were “cleansing the community” of gays and “we are working for Jonathan” in reference to the then President Goodluck Jonathan.” Some were even brought to the police station, where police officers insulted them and joined the mob violence. The senior police officer warned the victims of the mob that they had 48 hours to leave the village.
Another way LGBTQ+ individuals are put at risk by the law is throughaccess to healthcare. Nigeria is the country with the second largest HIV epidemic in the world, with3.4 million people living with HIV, and with an increased frequency in homosexual males. LGBTQ+ individuals living with the disease are unfairly affected as the police have raided NGOs that are providing HIV treatments to the LGBTQ+ community in Nigeria for “promoting homosexuality”.
This was the case of an HIV awareness meeting in Abuja in January 2014, where 12 were arrested and forced to pay a bribe of 100,000 Naira (£194.50) for bail. Understandably, the number of people living with HIV seeking treatment has plummeted. According to Ifeanyi Orazulike, an HIV clinic owner in Abuja “we used to have about 60 people a month; post-law, it is down to about 10 to 15 people (…) for fear of going to prison, people preferred to stay at home on their sick bed.”
Despite what was mentioned above, change may be coming to the African country. According to Reuters, a recent NOI Poll has shown that the number of people who believe that LGBTQ+ individuals should have equal access to public services has risen from30% to 39% between the years 2015 and 2017.As stated by Olumide Makanjuola, executive director of The Initiative for Equal Rights, “these changes might look small, but let us acknowledge the progress. The fact that there is a small differential is important to acknowledge. Nigeria is not an easy place to have such conversations.”
Furthermore, the number of violent acts has decreased since 2016. However, the director of the Initiative for Equal Rights,Omolara Oriye, said“what has risen significantly is extortion, blackmail, infringement of rights to assembly, and police malpractice. This is happening through apps like Grindr and social media”.

Let’s Tune In: The Leader of the Middle East is Out of Control,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
Israeliknesset(the name of Israel’s parliament) voted to disperse on 30th June 2022 and to hold new elections in November. This vote ended the shortest government Israel has ever had and the Presidency adventure of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Bennett’s role will be taken by Yesh Atid (Israeli political party) head Yair Lapid who will become Prime Minister.
From the parliamentary elections of April 2019, the Israeli government experienced several problems with the Knesset. Since that election, the country experienced five elections in three and a half years. Despite a majority of Knesset members being right-wing in April 2019, BenjaminNetanyahu, the head of Israel’s largest party, the right-wing Likud, was unable to form a government and the Knesset dissolved itself. Another election six months later also did not lead to a government and the Knesset dissolved itself again. Then, in March 2020, a unity government between Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, of the Blue and White party, was formed, but it collapsed in December of the same year.
This instability could be addressed by assuming that the electoral system based on nationwide proportional representation of the country could have had an important role but this would not explain everything because in general there were 20 parliamentary elections in 75 years. Sure, the proportional electoral system has had its role in this instability, but, the political scenario in general changed with the weakening of the strongest parties in favor of the smalls, the personalization of politics, and in the end the loss of control of the legislative process by the Prime Minister. Another factor could have been the brutally changing Israel’s politics experienced when there was an important turmoil that involved Netanyahu the last important country’s leader who led Israel from 2009 until 2021.
Netanyahu’s travails allowed an opening for Bennett and Lapid, who did the unimaginable, and formed a coalition that included parties from Israel’s right and left, as well as an Islamist one representing Palestinian citizens of Israel. These ideological differences in one coalition were a first for Israel and, in the end, it did not work anyway.
At the moment Yair Lapid will be the Prime Minister of Israel, until the 1st of November 2022. He is the head of the Yesh Atid which is a liberal political party in Israel. Founded by Yair Lapid in 2012, it seeks to represent what it considers the center of Israeli society: the secular middle class. It focuses primarily on civic, socio-economic, and governance issues, including government reform and ending military draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox.
Professor Gideon Rahat holds the Gersten Family Chair in Political on the Netanyau Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said: “He [Netanyahu] has a trial and the only way he thinks he can defend himself in this trial is by staying in politics and using his political power to defend himself,” Rahat said. “He remembers what happened to [former Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert, who went to jail [for corruption], and he’s afraid the same will happen to him. I think that once he has the opportunity, he will try to change the [judicial] system for his own good to make sure he doesn’t go to jail or that his trial will take forever.”
Netanyahu said in an address to parliament ahead of Thursday’s vote: “They promised change, they spoke about healing, they tried an experiment, and the experiment failed..,We are the only alternative: a strong, stable, responsible nationalist government.”
The situation in Israel is complex and not only there but also in theMiddle East. The country had never faced this kind of crisis and this period (from 1st July-1st November 2022) will be necessary to make order in the political scenario and the coalitions. Maybe the scenario needs a change in its proportional electoral system due to the change they experienced and, surely, Israel needs to clarify Netanyahu’s position and his involvement in the scandals he is facing.
Will Israel be able to manage this political fragmentation? Will Israel return to be politically stable?","July 04, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/lets-tune-in-the-leader-of-the-middle-east-is-out-of-control/,Giuseppe Maria Bartalotta,thenewglobalorder.com,Let's Tune In
EU Mutual Defense: Which Challenges Are Ahead?,"The international community is currently forced to rethink its definitions of security and defense. Thebrutal war of aggression against Ukraine, launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on the morning of February 24th, has vehemently pushed the question of “What if” in case of adirect confrontationbetween Russia and NATO to the center of attention.
This question does not only seem to occupy the vast majority of multilateral political action but has also sparked broader debates on the nature and strength of the Western system of mutual defence.
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, today comprising 30 countries, states that:
“an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all” and that “each of them, in the exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence […], will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force”.
This mutual commitment to protect each other from aggression has been at the very core of the North Atlantic Alliance since its beginning, intended not least to create a shared sense of solidarity among its members.
But while this instrument is relatively well-known, little light is usually shed on the fact that theEuropean Unionhas quite a similar tool at its disposal. Its history dates back to the early 1950s when the Pleven Plan sought to establish aEuropean Defence Community(EDC). While these visions ultimately failed, the Paris Accords of 1954 paved the way a little bit later for the establishment of the now-defunct Western European Union (WEU) which had a mutual defense clause incorporated in Article 5 of its founding documents.
The following years saw a gradual shift of the center of gravity of collective defense towards the North Atlantic Alliance and a relatively dormant European defense clause. Not only did some critical member states fear an erosion of their neutrality, but they also sensed a possible duplication of NATO. The 2007 negotiations around the treaty amendments of Lisbon, which brought up again the question of how to deal with this particular provision, made an amended version of the clause an integral part of the TEU (Treaty on European Union). Article 42(7) states today that “if a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter”.
The amplified security challenges that the world is currently facing, not least caused by the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine, make it more relevant than ever to take a closer look at this often ignored feature of the European Union.
At first glance, Article 42(7) and its North Atlantic counterpart can be barely told apart. Both extend a state’s right to self-defense, written down in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, both allow for the use of armed force in case of outside aggression and both have been triggered only once since their invention, the NATO clause after the terror of 9/11 and the EU article after theNovember 2015 Islamist attacks in France.
However, one does not have to be an expert in International Law in order to detect someessential differences between the two provisions. While the North Atlantic Treaty limits the mutual defensecase to a situation of a direct armed attack, TEU Article 42(7) includes a broader range of aggressions and can theoretically be applied to modern non-traditional or hybrid threats. In contrast to the former, the European version would for example be invocable in the case of air incursions or naval blockades. Paying attention purely to the wording, the EU clause even appears to be stronger insofar as it creates an “obligation” for member states to provide assistance, while NATO’s Article 5 merely refers to “such action as it deems necessary”.
It is important to note that the EU’s mutual assistance clause hasdeliberately been drafted differently from its NATO counterpart, ensuring enough room for some countries’ traditional neutrality and taking into account NATO members’ simultaneous obligations. In fact, it allows the attacked party to retain a more significant amount of control over the process when otherwise it would have had to involve heavier NATO players like the US. In terms of the political message conveyed, this can make a difference. However, the French case has also shown that the final decision on any assistance provided remains first and foremost with the partner countries which might not apply the same interpretive scheme to the term “obligation”.
One reason forFinlandandSwedento have recently taken a bold step towards NATO membership might be their feeling that in case of an armed attack, assistance from fellow EU members would be too weak and too little backed by direct military clout. Indeed, the European mutual defense clause is often considered politically weak as opposed to the NATO provision, comprising not only the United States but also former EU member Britain. The EU as a political and economic union remains considered today as restricted in its crisis management and less capable than the North Atlantic Alliance founded with the very purpose of mutual military protection.
However, while some countries, especially small ones, have kept their traditional reluctant stance on strengthening the EU’s defense capabilities, other actors such as France’s Emmanuel Macron would like to see discussions on Article 42(7) and the prospects for a more autonomous Union take up more space. They argue that a common understanding of the member states’ tasks in case of aggression bestows a larger degree of autonomy upon a union whose voice usually stays marginal in these matters.
With particular strength, the currentcrisis in Ukrainehas revealed that a common European foreign policy and vision is needed. If the EU’s mutual assistance clause were to be invoked in the future, no country would join the efforts without having the feeling that its interests are, at least partly, served through a joint strategy. Knowledge of the existence of Article 42(7) and a serious debate about the conditions for its application can exert pressure to move forward with the integration of national approaches to external security challenges, but also to closer coordinate internal security and intelligence challenges.
This preparation seems important because, in situations of serious aggression, some parties might prefer to rely on EU security guarantees rather than accept the risk of escalation through an invocation of NATO Article 5. In the end, it should not be forgotten that the decision to resort to mutual assistance and the subsequent choice of means essentially remain political, not purely legal or technical.
The current considerations have shown that mutual assistance clearly goes beyond direct military intervention. Unlike NATO, the EU’s provision might allow for more flexibility in the future, opening up the view for approaches of complementarity rather than exclusivity. Especially for those countries that have so far rejected a rapprochement with NATO, the clause might play a role as a source of reassurance, provided the EU can create a certain degree of credibility.

The European supranational setting provides the advantage that an invocation of Article 42(7) and the actions subsequently taken do not only have to grow out of separate bilateral discussions but can be coordinated at the EU level. This might send if managed in the right way, a stronger signal of unity. The EU should therefore neither ignore its own mutual defense clause nor see it as a redundant doubling of well-known Article 5.
The current events should be impetus enough to rethink the provision and to spark the uncomfortable, but necessary debates regarding its interpretation and practical application. Only by running through potential scenarios and specific response types to different crises, will the EU be able to tailor the design of its common defense architecture to current and future security challenges.

"(Analysis) Resolution 1325: The Contribution and Limitation on Women, Peace & Security","Important gender norms are frequently supported by international law and policy in the context of peace and security. Although the disparate effects of armed conflict on men and women are becoming more widely acknowledged, gender equality and gender-specific provisions in international law have proven challenging. Advances in women’s rights and other international agreements, particularlyPart E of the Beijing Platform for Action on Women and Armed Conflict, have helped increase access to current legislation. Nevertheless, despite growing awareness of gender-based violence, they still continue to exist.
International political unrest increased with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, and state-on-state civil war eventually developed into a string of ongoing non-conventional battles with unclear borders, a contempt for international law, and the displacement of thousands of people. In light of the horrifying acts of violence against women and girls that occurred in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, some of the core elements of theWestphalia systemare called into doubt.
Themaintenance of international peace and securityis one of the purposes of theUnited Nations Charter.Violence and conflict undermine sustainable development, as such, action to protect and promote human rights is one of the main goals the United Nations tries to achieve. The adoption ofResolution 1325by the United Nations is as a result of the commitment and vision of both civil society and the member states of the UN to address the policy gap of the role of women in peacebuilding and the long-term impact of conflict on their lives.
1325is much more than a number or a resolution. In particular,Resolution 1325represents a historic watershed political framework that shows how women’s perspective are just as relevant as men when negotiating peace agreements, planning refugee camps and peacekeeping operations and reconstructing war-torn societies for sustainable peace. TheResolutionestablishes a leading step for other resolutions in regard to the topic on women, peace and security. WhenResolution 1325was adopted, hopes were high that there will be an increased number of women participating inpeacebuildingprocesses and decisions. However, after 20 years, women’s presence in peace processes is still remains minimal.Between 1992 and 2019, women constituted, on average, 13 percent of negotiators, 6 percent of mediators, and 6 percent of signatories in major peace processes around the world.Peace efforts in 2020 have similarly struggled to include women. For example, women represented only around 10 percent of negotiators in the Afghan talks, just 20 percent of negotiators in Libya’s political discussions, and 0 percent of negotiators in Libya’s military talks and Yemen’s recent process.
On October 31, 2000, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on women, peace, and security, highlighting the feature of all 15 members of the UN Security Council, including the P5, to vote ‘yes’ to theresolution. The members of the UN Security Council at the time of the adoption ofResolution 1325were: United States of America, China, Russia Federation, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, France, Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands, Russian Federation, Tunisia, and Ukraine.
This was the first time the UN Security Council had committed a resolution for women during peace and conflict. The coalition for women, peace, and security in the world became the driving force behind the creation of the Security CouncilResolution 1325 (S/RES/1325).TheResolutionalso emphasized the need for women’s equal participation and involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security, including conflict prevention and resolution, peace negotiations, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, humanitarian response, and post-war reconstruction. It lays out 18 points under four categories.
The foundation of theResolution 1325was twofold: a global declaration, serving as its intellectual foundation, and a regional action plan molding the resolution’s operational functioning. The former, the1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which had the support of 189 nations and contained a chapter on women and armed conflict, served as theintellectual foundationforResolution 1325.
The Windhoek Declaration and the Namibia Plan of Action on Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Support Operationswas adopted at a seminar hosted by the government of Namibia from May 29 to 31, 2000. Its main goal was to ensure women’s equal access to peacekeeping missions and operations, which were inspired by conflicts in the 1990s. The proposal was drafted by Namibia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Martin Angaba, and addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on July 12, 2000(A/55/138),among other worldwide policy initiatives.
The resolution was proposed by Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, then Namibian minister of women’s affairs, when Namibia took over UN Security Council presidency chair in 1999. At that time, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and countires like Namibia, Jamaica, and Canada, three additional elected Security Council members, all played supportive roles in the adoption ofResolution 1325.
Resolution 1325 has contributed vastly to international law by preceding actions on protecting women and girls in conflict while shedding light on the gender imbalances in the decision making of peacebuilding processes.Resolution 1325calls on all UN member states to increase women’s involvement and gender perspectives in all UN peace and security initiatives. It does this by emphasizing how violent conflict and war disproportionately affect women and girls. It also exhorts all parties to make extraordinary measures to protect women and children from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, in the event of an armed conflict. The resolution includes a number of crucial operational directives that affect UN member states.
The first landmark resolution of the UN Security Council on women’s peace and security,Resolution 1325, also addressed the effects of war on women and the significance of women’s involvement in conflict resolution, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, humanitarian response, and post-conflict reconstruction. Participation, protection, prevention, alleviation, and recovery are the four essential pillars oftheResolution.TheResolutionALSO calls for the participation of women at all levels in decision-making, conflict prevention, and conflict management; it also calls for the protection of women and girls from sexual and gender-based violence, including in humanitarian situations such as refugee camps; for bettering strategies for preventing violence against women and prosecuting those who commit violations, and calls for the advancement of relief and recovery measures to address international issues.
It is important to keep in mind thatResolution 1325addressed the specific protection requirements of women and girls in conflict and drew attention to the gender imbalance in UN programming, security, and peacekeeping missions. It also included provisions for greater participation and representation of women at all levels of decision-making. Undoubtedly, the adoption of theResolutionwas a turning point in the international campaign for women’s rights and gender equality.Resolution 1325is the first international document to protect and integrate women at all levels and it paved the way for additional resolutions. It has empowered women to demand what is rightfully theirs and compelled member states to acknowledge that women are human beings with the ability to accomplish the same things as men on a global scale.
According toKatherine Barnes,Resolution 1325introduced gender concerns into the mainstream and gave the international community a credible framework that could be adopted and utilized. In addition, according toTorunn L. Tryggestad’sanalysis, the Security Council’s acceptance of theResolutiondissolved the barrier between women’s issues and international peace and security, paving the way for new standards to emerge. According toPratt and Richter Devroe’sstudy,Resolution 1325managed to strike a balance between women as human beings in need of protection and equals with valuable contributions to make at all levels of peace and conflict resolution processes.
Despite the contributions made byResolution 1325, there have been some shortcomings. For instance, theResolutionstill lacks enforcement mechanisms, ignoring women’s role in peacebuilding process and violence against women and girls still occurring.  Moreover, policymakers at the national and international levels continue to ignore the crucial role that women play in maintaining peace and advancing peace processes. It is not surprising, given that the language used in theResolutionis not meant for enforcement, as there is nooperative phrasefor enforcement actions – implying that theResolutiondoes not‘enforce’ or ‘demand’ member states to carry out any of the Security Council’s actions. Instead, the operative phrases urge, encourage, recognize, and emphasizes action. In other words, there are no hard words that “demand member state to carry out particular actions,” thereby opening opportunities for member state to decide if they want to implement the decisions of theResolutionin their country.
Violence against women and girl still occurs even after a decadeResolution 1325being adopted. In 2013,The Atlanticpublished an article entitled “Syria has a Massive Rape Crisis” in which focused on girls tortured, raped, and humiliated by soldiers. They compared this rape crisis to the Bosnian war, where tens of thousands of women were raped and tortured. This is a weak spot for the UN asResolution 1325was created before to the Syrian War.
The framework ofResolution 1325gives no clear indication of how a gender mainstreaming process based on gender-based violence indicators could work in a peace and security environment. InResolution 1325Clause 10, relating to gender-specific protective measures, the Security Council“Calls on all parties to armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence in situations of armed conflict.’‘ This clause emphasizes that recognizing gender-specific harms is an integral part of the gender mainstreaming process since it allows for the development of relevant policy responses. UN Security Council Resolution 1325reinforces the public sphere bias of international legal instruments by failing to address how structural forms of violence frequently worsen gender inequality.
TheResolutionalso overlooked the fact that men and boys can be victims of sexual violence, while ignoring the fact that women could commit violations too.Resolution 1325was not specific enough in describing the roles men and boys could play in contributing to an equal society and human rights for all.
Nevertheless, with the disparities inResolution 1325, the latter still addresses and recognizes how woman and girls are impacted by violent conflict and recognizes the important role women have played and continue to play in peacebuilding operations. It importantly identifies women as active rather than passive recipients, an important aspect as women’s participation in peacebuilding operations is a right rather than something given to them by the goodwill of men.","November 30, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/ready-analysis-resolution-1325-the-contribution-and-limitation-on-women-peace-security/,Fehintola Akinbamidele,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
South Africa: First Sub-Saharan Country to Implement a Sugar Tax,"South Africa‘s health department is facing a huge amount of comorbidity which has led to the government implementing a Health Promotion Levy. Not only does this benefit the health department, but it simultaneously benefits the economic well-being of the country.
In April 2018,South Africabecame the first Sub-Saharan nation to initiate a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), namely theHealth Promotion Levy(HPL). According to Goudaet al,in theBurden of non-communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, 1990-2017: Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, within Sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa has one of the highest levels of burden related to non-communicable diseases; this occurred simultaneously with a rapid rise of SSB sales. At the same time, South Africa continues to fight HIV/AIDS as well as tuberculosis. It is important to note that almost17% of the populationlives under the international poverty line within the context of an inequality-adjusted Human Development Index of 0.463.
Concurrently,55.5% live below the current South African food poverty lineof R441 per capita per month, equivalent to 40 US dollars. Considering these factors, the Department of Health’s National Health Strategic Plan of 2015-2020 prioritizes addressing the social determinants that affect health and diseases through preventing and reducing the disease burden, promoting health, and financing universal healthcare coverage.
Views on Sugar and Its Implications
Sugar, particularly in liquid form in beverages, has been viewed as an important cause of theincreased risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,and many common cancers. According toHofman, Popkin et al., the simulated mathematical model-based research showed that a 20% price increase on SSBs would result in lowering obesity prevalence by 2.4%-3.8% points, thus averting 8500 incident stroke cases, 550,000 stroke-related disability-adjusted life years, and 72,000 deaths among South African adults. This means that the estimated savings are calculated to be over 5 billion South African Rand in healthcare costs over 20 years while also increasing the tax revenue.
These improvements would have a greater positive impact on the lower-income individuals who have less access to healthcare resources. These lower-income individuals solely rely on public health services and makeup 85% of the population according to theNational Health Act.
The nationwide lockdown that was implemented in March 2020 led to demand and supply-side shifts. In supply, human resources shifts have led to limited services for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of communicable diseases. Those who have uncontrollable comorbidities are at a higher risk for death but more especiallythose who are obese and have conditions related to obesity such as hypertension. The lockdown policies implemented inSouth Africahave been praised in that they had slowed down the transmission of the virus in the early stages but also caused economic disruption. During the period ofquarter 3 of 2019 and quarter 3 of 2020, the employment rate amongst adults inSouth Africadecreased by 1.684 million, while the number of unemployed and not economically active adults increased by 2.269 million.
The average gross earnings paid to employees decreased by R43.848 billion during theCovid-19 periodQuarterly employment statistics (QES). In response to this economic crisis, the South African government responded to the welfare impacts through the increase in the value of the existing social grants and by introducing temporary COVID-19 relief of social distress cash grants for those who were not eligible for the existing social support. Through these interventions, they were however not enough to prevent the increases in food security.  Telephonic surveys indicate that 47% of households report not having enough money to buy food according to theHousehold resource flows and food poverty during South Africa’s lockdown. There is a risk of there being an increase in obesity and diabetes rate and prevalence through food security. This is further fueled by the increasing food prices as well as the consumption of innutritious, energy-dense cheap foods which are highly processed. The impacts as a result of COVID-19 on the government indicate that therevenue needs have increased quickly due to the higher financial needs and anticipated loss in income and corporate tax revenues. HPL in this instance can address the needs that are directed at supporting health.
Intersectoral Health Promotion Policies and Needs to Strengthen HPL
The health benefits that come with the reduced SSB intake can further be evaluated and adjusted to a 20% rate that was originally proposed by the South African National Treasury. This has to be inflation-indexed. The HPL also has the ability to enable double-duty benefits, in the event that the collected tax revenues are used to finance other health-promoting and equity-enhancing programs. These are urgently needed, especially during theCOVID-19 situation. It is important to note how other countries have tried to strengthen their economy through the HPL. The Thai Health Promotion Foundation is a structure that is a representation of various sectors and ministries, all of which converge on the same pre-decided health targets and notes that thesehealth targets cannot be achieved by one sector. South Africa has proposed health promotions and development foundations that were used to direct theHPL revenue to health promotion across different sectors and ministries.
South Africa has 12 mills that include six companies. Millers in South Africa are facing demand and supply-side challenges. The decrease in the international prices of sugar has had a negative impact on the revenue as well as the decrease in demand for sugar due to the SSB manufacturershas and continue to challengemillers. Millers have found alternatives to improve their production process or even find ways to diversify their production. Many SSB manufacturers that have previously relied mostly on sugar in their production process before the introduction of a sugar tax have turned tousing artificial sweeteners.
In 2018, South Africa implemented the Health Promotion Levy. Monitoring the sugar consumption during the first year, it was evident that thepolicy indeed reduced the sugar consumption from SSBswhich in turn may have positive health benefits in the future. This is beneficial to the lower-income South Africans as they have poor access to healthcare services. Covid-19 struck and the importance of having the HPL was evident as mortality was higher among people who had obesity-related NCDs and Covid-19 highlighted the importance of inter-sectoral health promotion policies.

Ecuador and its Dividing Strikes,"In June 2022,Ecuadorexperienced an 18-day-long nationwide strike led by the indigenous movement. Although this strike was the longest in recent Ecuadorian history,it is not an isolated occurrence. In fact, in October 2019 the indigenous movement and other social movements led an 11-day-long strike. These two events show similarities in terms of the leading agents and some of their causes but are especially different when looking at their outcomes.
To understand the two most recent national strikes in Ecuador, it is essential to understand the importance and power ofThe Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador(CONAIE) holds. This organization serves as a national representative to the various indigenous groups in the country, and although they are not a political party nor do they have direct representation in the National Assembly, CONAIE holds important levels of legitimacy among indigenous people. Indeed, once a protest or strike has been announced by its leadership, indigenous groups from all parts of the country will join and follow the CONAIE’s instructions.
Both, in 2019 and 2022, CONAIE, and more specifically, its leaderLeonidas Izacalled on the rest of the population to rise and protest against the government’s policies. However, it is important to notice that the 2019 strike was also joined by other social groups such as drivers’ unions and student unions. In the 2022 case, the protests were led in its great majority byindigenous groupsand saw the financial and logistic assistance of other individuals, but no formal organizations or groups announced publicly they were joining the fight in the streets. This is a crucial difference between the two strikes. The fact that more people and formal groups decided to directly part-take in the 2019 protests created a sense of greater commitment to the cause in the general Ecuadorian population.
When speaking about causes leading to the two strikes,gas prices are the common denominator. For decades, the Ecuadorian government has provided subsidies for gasoline. Consequently,when former president Moreno announced in 2019 that these aids will come to an end, the social uprising was imminent, as price gouging for essential items was almost immediate. In the case of the most recent strike, gas prices played an important role. However, this time there was no one specific trigger for the protests. On the contrary, the causes for this strike were multiple. In fact, the indigenous movement (CONAIE) presented a list of ten demands. These demands included:
From this list, it is evident that the concerns of those protesting were much more extensive and covered multiple areas, contrary to the 2019 strike.
These two sets of protests shared similar motivations and leaders, but their outcomes were completely different. On the one hand, the 2019 strikeended as former President Lenin Moreno went back on his decision and reinstated gas subsidiesin the country. As soon as the President announced this, the protests ended and the country went back to normal in a matter of days. Of course, the physical consequences (i.e., business destruction, material defacement, road damages) took more time to recover.
On the other hand,the process to end the 2022 strike was longerand has been composed ofmultiple negotiations and consultationsamong the various indigenous organizations and the government.The 2022 strike officially ended on June 30, but the document sealing the peace is a long-term commitment to dialogue between the government and indigenous organizations mediated by the representation of the Catholic Church in Ecuador. Additionally, these negotiations were tainted with verbal accusations regarding the protests’ source of funding, the murder of a soldier, and the levels of legitimacy that both; Iza and the government’s representative to the negotiation, possessed. In the end, the initial agreements refer to gas prices and the creation of spaces for dialogue to discuss the remaining 9 demands the CONAIE had initially presented. In other words, although the country has pretty much gone back to its normal activities, one cannot rule out future protests if the spaces  created for dialogue fail to reach agreements between the parties.
The dichotomy of these two outcomes mirrors the difference in motivations and causes for each of the strikes. However, it is interesting to notice that despite the 2019 strike gathering many more social sectors and having witnessed more participation in terms of the number of protesters from different organizations, the outcome of the strike seemed to be much faster than that of the 2022 strike. Looking at this particularity from a negotiation perspective, it is evident that former president Moreno realized the enormous challenge that negotiating and dialoguing with multiple groups represents. Thus, he decided on a solution that would directly address the concern driving the uprising. On his part, president Guillermo Lasso has decided to give dialogue and collaboration a try.
Hopefully, this attempt will be effective in creating collaborative spaces for any and all social groups, so that in the future national strikes with catastrophic economic and human consequences will not be encouraged by the CONAIE or any other organization. In the end, if these two strikes demonstrate anything, it is the grave social fracture Ecuador presents, one that reaches across social and economic sectors and is also based on race and power dynamics.

The Presidential Image: Do Polls Tell the Truth About Gabriel Boric?,"On March 11, 2021, Gabriel Boric won the Chilean presidential election with 55.8% of the votes. Fast forward four months later and recent polls showcase a high level of disapproval –up to 50%– for his administration. It is worth wondering how does Boric, the highest-attaining percentage president in the history of Chile, get such a bad image in only four months of governing? Are polls to be trusted?
Gabriel Boric’s election wasrecord-breakingin two aspects: he is the youngest Chilean president in history at 36 years old and the most successful president to have attained a large majority of the votes in the country’s history, with about 8.3 million people voting for Boric.
Although he has been involved in politics since his time at university, it was in 2013 that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the lower house. In 2020 he tried to run for office, yet, he quickly dropped out of the campaign. The next year, his alliance, Convergencia Social, obtained 25.8% of the votes which took him to a runoff election along with José Antonio Kast from the Partido Republicano – a conservative right-center party. Before the runoff, Boric received public support from ex-Chilean presidents Michelle Bachelet and Ricardo Lagos; as well as, national left-center parties and alliances such as Partido Socialista, Demócrata Cristiano, Liberal, Progresista, Radical, Ecologista Verde, Igualdad, Humanista y Ciudadanos. The historic rise to the presidency of a young politician with a relatively short career in public administration like Boric showed an interesting new perspective on political candidates’ profiles, especially for modern Chilean society that has often been described as traditional and generally uninterested in politics.
A survey conducted byCademhighlights a downward trend in relation to president Boric’s image as well as his governing skills. The approval for his administration is at an all-time low (59%) and his leadership abilities became stagnant at 38% of approval while also receiving poor approval rankings for his ability to maintain public order (32%), manage immigration (32%) and to deal with crime (28%).
A similar trend is seen in connection to his cabinet of ministers. The image of his governmental team has a 39% approval rate. It is worth mentioning, however, that this low percentage can be connected to the issues that took place in La Araucanía, which is known for a long and ongoing conflict regarding native American communities –mostly Mapuches– demanding the return of usurped lands by the State who in course sold to private investors. In this context, Home Secretary, Izkia Siches, faces the most criticism. As a consequence of the escalation of violence and protests in La Araucanía, Siches renewed the state of emergency receiving a strong backlash from the Mapuche community.
According to Cadem’s survey, only 25% of those consulted consider Boric of having the capacity to resolve said conflict. Not long after the survey results were made public, Boricaddressed the nationin the annual report on public accounts. In the two-hour-long speech, he announced a series of measures in both the social and economic agendas, particularly a National Health Fund, an increase in the minimum wage, and the reduction of the weekly workday by up to 40 hours.
Polls do not equal truth. Instead they are a useful tool that reflects, to a certain point, public opinion in a pre-set and defined timeframe. Therefore, their results must be analyzed afterwards. Generally speaking, in social sciences, polls help understand the social perception of certain topics, objects, or people. In political campaigning, in particular, consulting agencies run polls multiple times a month, as public opinion can be very volatile, especially in times of fast media consumption and“fake news.”This volatility can explain some of the reasons behind Boric’s poor presidential ranking. During elections, public discussion tends to be highly centered around the candidates. Therefore, and inevitably, their images grow. Boric was portrayed by the media and by his campaign team as the young candidate breaking through the establishment that Kast –his opponent– embodied. Once he won, the public interest naturally died down.
It is also worth mentioning that Boric’s predecessor, Sebastián Piñera, was also his total opposite, being a conservative 72-year-old politician with decades of experience in public administration and who had already completed two non-consecutive presidential terms (2010-2014 and 2018-2022). Piñera received plenty of criticism as a consequence of his management of the social crisis that took place in Chile in 2019, where his administration was accused of violence and torture toward arrested protesters. All this is established in a report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (ACNUDH). In this context, it is understandable that Boric’s image became highly popular, both his opponent and predecessor were similarly poorly perceived by the public and had similar “established” political views. This scenario may have helped him grow his image as a political alternative and eventually lead to him winning the election.
Another reason for Boric’s current popularity drop could be linked to mass media. By publishing Cadem’s survey results, the public may even develop stronger opinions – good or bad – about the Chilean president as a consequence of the media coverage. In other words, continual new coverage about Boric’s public and presidential image abating can perpetuate that trend. As the well-knownMass Communication Modeldeveloped by the sociologist Harold D. Lasswell states: “the media cannot tell people what to think, but it can tell them what topics they should have opinions on.”
Finally, a third reason why this phenomenon may be taking place can be associated with German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann’sspiral of silencewhich states that people have a tendency to lie about the views they have on certain topics – politics in particular – especially if they are not “socially accepted.” This scenario constitutes aspiral of silence, which raises questions regarding the accuracy of public opinion polls.
Probably the best conclusion to take from what the polls show is that public opinion changes constantly. It is important to start seeing polls as analysis tools, and, most importantly, to use them as such. This means that mere survey results do not have much substance on their own. On the contrary, comparative analyses of different polls can be way more useful in drawing conclusions and sharing them with the public.","December 14, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-presidential-image-do-polls-tell-the-truth-about-gabriel-boric/,Carola López,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
A Conversation with the Lawyer of Çilem Doğan: Punished for not Dying,"Çilem Doğan’s story is a sad reality. A reality involving violence that goes unnoticed and unpunished. A reality that denies the right of women to protect themselves and condemns them for having the audacity to survive the domestic violence they face on a daily basis. A reality which pushes the oppressed to kill their oppressor out of desperation. Beaten, violated, dispossessed of their bodies and abandoned, this story reflects the tenacity of women towards a system that crushes them. This reality is above all an act of defiance against a society that has stopped listening to its female entities. This is the story of Çilem Doğan and her use of self-defence against her abusive husband who forced her into prostitution.
From the first months of her marriage to Hasan Karabulut, Çilem Doğan is suffering his uncontrollable violence.
Indeed, according to Doğan, her husband tried to force her into prostitution a month shortly after they got married in the eastern Mediterranean province of Adana. After refusing, she was locked up at home for three days without food or water. Her mother managed to get her out. Immediately, she tried to escape her husband but soon learned that she was pregnant and thus, had to stay. The battering never stopped!
As Doğan’s domestic violence escalates, the young woman repeatedly turned to the police in the hope of escaping her husband. During her trial, she indeed explained having lost count of how many times she sought help from the police.
Six different lawsuits were filed against Hasan Karabulut at criminal judgeships of the first instance on charges of “threat” against his spouse and “wounding” her. In addition to the complaints against her husband,the number of protection orders was ultimately revealed to stand at nine.
In well to seeking police assistance, Çilem tried unsuccessfully to divorce her partner. Indeed, her family, and Hasan’s one, rejected her requests for a divorce, leading to an increase in the violence inflicted upon her.
The last straw came on 8 July 2015 in Adana province of Turkey. Doğan explains; “He came home in the morning on the day of the incident. He slept for a short time and then wanted me to prepare his luggage. I asked him why. He said we would go to Antalya together and I would become a prostitute. When I opposed it, he beat me. He pushed me onto the bed and the pistol under the pillow came into my mind. I grabbed it and shot him repeatedly. After that, I took my daughter and left home.” She then immediately surrendered to the police.
Following her arrest, Çilem Doğan got first sentenced to anaggravated life sentenceon charges of involuntary manslaughter at the Adana 10th High Criminal Court.
At the hearing on May 6, 2016, Çilem Doğan’s lawyers presented a report on the “battered woman defence” to the court and demanded acquittal on the grounds of self-defence given the violence to which she had been subjected. The Adana Public Prosecutor, however, demanded 18 to 24 years in prison on the charge of “wilful killing under grave and unjust provocation”. From the very beginning of her trials, Çilem repeatedly claimed to have acted out of self-defence. She stated that she tried to protect herself from violence by all possible means.
In his final opinion, the prosecutor demanded that the act should not consider self-defence since Çilem Doğan
“did not seek shelter in her family’s place, did not benefit from measures such as changing her identity, plastic surgery etc.”
She was then asked “why” she continued to live under the same roof as her husband, despite her repeatedly having stated that she tried to divorce him.  Afterwards, she was blamed by the court as to why she withdrew some of her criminal complaints against Hasan Karabulut.
Facing a lifetime in prison at the Adana 10th High Criminal Court, Doğan was then sentenced to 15 years behind bars with sentence reductions on the grounds of “unjust provocation and good conduct.”
Her lawyerappealed against the decision and requested her release under judicial control. The court board released her on 20 June 2016 on bail (stipulated at TL 50,000).
Unfortunately, the case got sent to the Supreme Court located in Ankara which upheld Çilem’s sentence. On November 4th, 2021, the heavy verdict came in and entailed the re-arrestation of Çilem Doğan. Indeed, the Constitutional Court condemned her to stay behind bars for 15 years.
Right after the decision was heard, Çilem Doğan published the following message on social media ;
“You did not imprison Çilem Doğan by approving the 15-year sentence. You’ve imprisoned an 8-year-old girl and all the women in the world.
We didn’t expect anything from male justice, we didn’t. It didn’t mislead us again.
We women will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder so that our eyes lashed don’t fall on the floor.
My daughter Misra Su is in your care, women.
The women’s struggle will win.
I embrace all women with solidarity”.
Immediately after Doğan’s arrest,feminists from all over Turkeycame together to support her.
Many Turkish women behind bars for killing their husbands have hefty files full of official domestic violence complaints, including protective orders. Doğan’s story was no different.
On the day of her first arrest, the young woman shouted to the press “Why should women always die!” In a country where themurder of women has skyrocketed in recent years, Doğan’s gesture became a singular act of defiance and inspired others to speak out.
Therefore, activists, students, mothers etc. came to the streets of Turkey calling for Doğan’s acquittal and insisting that self-defence is a legitimate right. Every hearing during her trial was accompanied by heavy demonstrations not only on the boulevards but also on social media. A petition campaign demanding her acquittal has gathered more than 130,000 signatures. Quickly, the figure of Çilem Doğan became one of a hero and particularly on social media.
The shirt which reads “Dear past, thanks for all the lessons. Dear future, I am ready” which Doğan happened to be wearing on the day of her arrest even became a symbol in the struggle for women’s rights and has been quoted as the slogan of the year.
The general mobilisation around Doğan’s case revolves around the identification of other women in her situation, as her lawyer Cemre Topal, whom I interviewed, pointed out ;
“The first time Çilem Doğan was being seen in public after having been arrested, she was fearless. I am not saying she wasn’t feeling guilty but she wasn’t scared. She knew she had to protect her life and one of her daughters. There was a kind of revenge or stronger message that says;it is not always women who die in this world.”
This attitude of defiance frightened the government. It caused indignation towards the power in place but also admiration towards Dogan. “She sort of enfranchised herself from being the property of someone in a patriarchal system. That is certainly an example to follow.”
This activist lawyer who dedicates her career to defending the cause of women’s rights highlights that her client changed the narrative of domestic violence in Turkey.
“We are now capable of saying that we embrace the feminist revolution which has started already. For us, it is not finished. It is just the beginning and the new generation is ready to fight for it! We are gonna open the door, confront the justice and push the politicians in order to get our rights respected.”
“Çilem Doğan is given 15 years too much in prison but even if it reacquires us to do something extraordinary, we will change this unjust decision. We will recall the case to reclaim the verdict.”
Following the final verdict, Sevil Araci, one of her attorneys stressed the following “With this verdict, Çilem Doğan has become one of the women who are punished because they didn’t die.”
Doğan’s case and those of other women who kill their husbands in similar circumstances raise the question of whether they would have been killed if they had received effective protection from authorities after seeking help against their abusers. “I never wanted this to happen, but I had no other option,” Çilem said, in her closing statement at trial.
In their case, resorting to a gun or a knife is usually a last, desperate measure after repeated requests for help from the police.  Such murders are not simply a matter of an individual decision, but also involve authorities’  inaction, in failing to protect women who are being battered. The courts and other authorities, therefore, prove to be futile in breaking the pattern of domestic violence.
“This situation illustrates perfectly the fact that the current government doesn’t protect and doesn’t want to protect women in Turkey.”
Indeed, as stressed by her lawyer,Cemre Topal, Çilemreported 9 timesthe domestic violence she was suffering, hoping to receive some protection. The capable authority denied and neglected that woman’s accusations and so, as a consequence, she had to resort to self-defence to live.
“It is a great example of the consequences of the incompetence of a government to protect the life of women in Turkey” stressed Cemre Topal. “Çilem Doğan had lodged countless complaints with the police and prosecutors. She committed the murder to stop an unjust attack against herself. Women are always pictured in second place. TheTurkish Judiciary system is ineffective in terms of protection of half of the population.”
I then asked the lawyer if she thought that the high judiciary court’s decision set an example to show Turkish women that self-defence will not be tolerated.
“ Yes, absolutely! Within this case, there was a lot of false information, a lot of emptiness, false testimonies etc. They have botched this trial and the investigations that were necessary for the proper conduct of the legal process. They tried to make the judgement as fast as possible to give the 15 years sentence in order to, as you said, set the example and so, definitely condemn self-defence. During the very first trial in Adana, the prosecutors, as well as the president of the court, were amazing and all claimed; self-defence.”
“But in Ankara everything changed. The trial became political!”
It goes without saying that the judiciary organ of a country should remain neutral and independent as well as fair and impartial in order to ensure and promote the check and balance system of democracy. This case underlinesthe severe politicisation of the judiciary system in Turkey.  Indeed, in accordance with the chronological steps of this trial, the basis of the independence of the judiciary organ has been violated and so has the principle of check and balance. By witnessing the national acclaim that the case of Çilem Doğan case has received, the government intended to give a symbolic lesson to prevent a loss of control margins of the judgment which had been rendered on 20 June 2016. While she was released under judicial control, the handling of the case by the Supreme Court drastically changed the verdict. The judicial service failed at ensuring to take all the necessary steps to provide a fair trial; false testimony, lack of investigation etc. as denounced by Cemre Topal. It must be noted that her demands for fair trials got systematically rejected during the court proceedings.
This example, therefore, illustrates that the political philosophy of the Turkish ruling party heavily influenced the final decision of the judicial organ of the country which should be neutral and independent from any political pressure. The decision initially made by the judicial system has been changed in favour of a more conservative verdict. The value of the check and balance system has been endangered and so has the Turkish democracyonce again.
“Çilem has no regrets regarding what she did. She was killed for the sole purpose of surviving against a man who could probably have killed her by now. It’s the state that failed her and her daughter” condemns Topal.
For a few years, to protect the family vision in Turkey, the paradigm of domestic violence has shifted. The ruling government considers diminishing domestic violence protection to disincentivize women from seeking a divorce. Hence, in 2016, the parliament recommended that; “Women should prove their partner’s violence to receive extended police protection”. Within this scenario, the burden of responsibility is therefore on the women victims of domestic violence. In short, they have to prove their victim status. Despite Çilem Doğan’s attempts to seek police protection, the court found her responsible for her lack of evidence and lack of will. Indeed, she did not resort to plastic surgery to change her appearance as the judge regretted. She also failed to prove, on 9 occasions, the violence of her partner. The fault resides with the victim.
This understanding of the law could thus allow the following interpretation; in Turkey, the woman victim of domestic violence has to undertake the role of a policeman by collecting the necessary evidence to be believed and by taking enough steps to protect her children and her integrity from the violence of her husband.
Thus, the government should not be so surprised when the victim, converted into a police officer, kills the man who assaulted her with a gun. Police officers are indeed armed and the use of a weapon is reserved for legitimate defence in cases of imminent danger to life.
This is the sad reality of a state that fails to protect women from the domestic violence that escalates in a country where it isnot convenient to be of the second sex.
This is the reality that pushes victims to become guilty of the ultimate crime of desperation and abandonment by the police and thus the state.
“Even if that decision discouraged women in the sense that they cannot be protected by the law nor the state, Çilem herself encouraged women. She might now be in prison but she could be dead. I think that a lot of women would rather be in prison than be beaten by their husbands. It is encouraging that she is alive and that she is fighting for her rights” concluded Cemre Topal.
An emblem of defiance for some, a symbol of danger for others, heavily condemned in the courts, and loudly defended in the streets, Çilem Doğan’s story is ultimately indicative of a societal split. Although Doğan will remain locked up in prison for years, her singular act of defiance has inspired others to liberate women’s rights in Turkey.","December 16, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-second-voice/a-conversation-with-the-lawyer-of-cilem-dogan-punished-for-not-dying/,Margaux Seigneur,thenewglobalorder.com,The Second Voice
Let’s Tune In: Waves of Protests in Iraq,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
On Saturday there was the umpteenth protest against the Iraqi Parliament conducted by the supporters of Iraqi clericMuqtada al-Sadr. During the protest, at least 125 people were injured and this was the second protest of the week with the first on Wednesday. The protest on Saturday broke again the high-securityGreen Zonein Baghdad and continued inside the Parliament due to the will to stop the election of an alleged Pro-Iran Prime Minister who is personified byMohammed Shia’ Al Sudani.
The Iraqi crisis started in October 2021, after the political election, which did not give a clear majority to the executive and so on the country. It is important to highlight that the voters were around 44% of the population and it was the lowest turnout since the US intervention in Iraq. The election’s result gave away important answers. The winner of the election was Shia leaderMuqtada al-Sadrwith his movement Sadrist Movement who gained 73 of the 329 seats. Other parties like the Al-Fatah alliance fell to 17 seats, and the Progress Party led by Mohammed al-Halbousi, a Sunni, took 37 seats. the Former Prime Minister’s party, Nouri al-Maliki’s State of Law took 33 seats. The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) captured 31 seats, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) received 18.
On 25th July 2022, after the political deathlock, It seemed like Iraq could live differently due to the nomination ofMohammed Shia’ Al Sudanibut this decision led to the first protest the day after and another on Saturday. However, he has several experience in the political field as Minister of Human Rights, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, as well as other roles. What people do not accept is his connections with Iran, connections that seem confirmed by the Iran-backed groups and militias, welcoming Sudani’s nomination in separate statements or tweets.
Demonstrators occupied the parliament floor and raised the Iraqi flag and portraits of al-Sadr, who has ordered his followers to stage a sit-in in the Green Zone. The protests are a pressure tactic used by him to derail government formation efforts lead by his political rivals in the Coalition Framework, an alliance of Shiite parties backed by Iran. WhatMuqtada al-Sadris fighting for is to stop the Iranian and the US influence over Iraq’s internal affairs and his followers are fervently fighting alongside him.
Iraq’s current Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi is known as the signatory of the agreement with the US that consisted on the withdrawal of the US armies from the country by the end of 2021, to protect security forces and official institutions protect official institutions.
What the world is looking at, is a huge political instability led by weak institutions and the strongest party of the parliament which is not enough big to rule the country. This is crucial because it cannot rule alone and it does not want coalitions. This topic is becoming a major source of instability due to the behavior of Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr. His supporters have been using violence for a week now and do not seem to step back. At the moment in Iraq, there is a Prime Minister who has not been elected during the last elections, a security force that is not able to assist and stop protesters, and failed communication between institutions that does not guarantee the correct functioning of democratic processes.
Muqtada al-Sadr’s party demonstrates that it does not want the end of democracy. Protesters have not seized the Parliament. However, what it is doing is unlawful because it interferes with Iraqi’s democratic rules, rules that the parties in the system should observe. This party is dangerous to Iraq’s democracy. The world knows it and must assess the situation before it goes out of hand.
What should the International Community do about Iraq? Will Muqtada al-Sadr accept to form a coalition?

Weaponisnig Migration To Europe: Humanitarian Crisis or Hybrid Warfare ?,"The issue of refugees and migration in Europe is, and always has been, a very sensitive topic. That is due partially for theobjective socio-economic implications of migrants and refugees,and for the political instrumentalization they suffer.  It follows, then whenever external factors push migration and refugees’ flows towards Europe, this inevitably impacts the political stability of the Union.It has happened in the 2010s during the so-called “migration crisis,” and it has been happening recently with the complex situation in Cyprus. Now,the war in Ukraine has reopened Pandora’s Box, and the Union is called to face and welcome a new wave of people finding refuge in its territoy. However, rather than  an inevitable consequence of an armed conflict, this migraton could hide more: a deliberate strategy from Russia to destabilize Europe in a delicate time by weaponizing migrations.  As such, it becomes imperative to determine what weaponizing migration entails, and investigate whether there is a foundation to claim that. Morever, as the European Commissionhas proposed a new Instrumentalization Regulation to address such issues in the area of migration and asylum, it needs to be evaluated whether the EU response on this matter manages to protect the interests of displaced migrants, or to exacerbate a delicate situation.
Looking back at the period between 2011-2016, the European Union was hit by a considerable migration wave stemming from the civil war in Syria. This movement created rising tensions and political conflict in the headquarters of Brussels, as theEU institutions struggled to cope with this flow, and the raging anti-migration parties which were surfacing in the Member States. Amid this growing instability, in February 2016 the Head of NATO Forces in Europe, General Philip Breedlove, came out with a resonating statement,“Together, Russia and the Assad regime are deliberately weaponizing migration from Syria. In an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve.”
This allegation did not come out of nowhere, nor did it  lack any ground to stand on. The strain that this migration flow had put on Europe was not merely a socioeconomic issue, it was a political and ideological fracture between EU members. A clear disruption emerged between southern and northern members, each feeling a lack of support from the other and a general sense of loosing control. The sense of mistrust was rising in Europe, andsome speculated that Russia had meddled with this crisis to weaponize the migration flowsin order to create a fracture in the EU and weaken its neighbor.However, how much of this can actually be proven? And if so, can we assume a similar situation is occurring now with Ukraine?
The concept of weaponized migration comes from thework of Kelly Greenhill, who created a substantive literature on this subject. According to the author, this form of hybrid warfare can takefour distinguished forms: Dispossessive, Extortive, Militarized and Coercive. While all of these frameworks provide relevant perspectives on this topic, it is the latter which appears to better fit theRussian behaviour. Indeed, this form of weaponized migration is based on the creation of aversion to asylum seekers from either ethno-nationalist or socioeconomic perspectives, to destabilize the political order of a country. This is meant to ultimately lead to fracturing in the regional and institutional cohesion of an enemy nation, thus weaponizing migration flows for strategic gains.
In regard to our hypothesis that Russia weaponized migration to destabilize the European political landscape we can note that during that period, not only did Russia support the Assad regime, which was the primary cause of this migration flow, but italso facilitated migration through state sponsorship towards the Finland and Norway borders to put pressure on the EU.This appeared as a deliberate choice from Russia, in order to retaliate after the sanctions imposed in 2014 after their first incursion in Crimea. However, it is imperative to note, that if this strategy was a deliberate attempt to either repel the sanctions, or to effectively harm the European Union, then it significantly lacked the scope and methodical implementation to be categorized as an actual form of hybrid warfare.In light of this, we cannot categorize Russia’s meddling with migration flows as an intentional attempt to weaken the European institutions. For what concerns the war in Syria, it appears that Greenhill claims were at best speculative at that time, and eventually this issue became dormant. Indeed, it seemed that even if that was within the objectives of Russia, it lacked the methodical implementation necessary to categorize it as a proper act of weaponised migration.
However with the illegitimate aggression towards Ukraine this February, Russia has once illustrated its ability toinstrumentalize migration flows. This  also follows the growing tensions between the Polish and Belarus border, where PresidentLukashenko publicly sponsored migrants towards the EU to foster instability, which  was dubbed by the Commission as a form of hybrid warfare. Thus, this begs for a re-evaluation of Russia’s and Belarus’ behavior, and to determine whether we can identify a form of coercive weaponizations of migrants, and to analyze the EU efforts to cope with this situation.
Over the past months, over 6.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country and found safe harbor in the EU, a number which must be aggregated with the thousands of other refugees from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan which were provided free transportation to the Polish border from the Belarus government. This volume of intake will inevitably increase the socio-economic strain of not only the region, but of Europe as a whole. Given its volume and systematic nanture,this flow of migrants appear to follow of a specific joint tactic from Russia and Belarusto destabilize the eastern border of Europe. That is, for it is meeting the two-fold condition set by Greenhill in her work: targeting of civilian infrastructure and facilitating transit to sensible borders. Indeed, Russia’s repeated effort to damage key infrastructure – for example, its massive targeting of electricty plants in the past few weeks –  has the outome of displacing people and prompting migration. Moreover,  through forms of sponsorship and smuggling, Russia and Belarus have been funneling migrants into sensible points of access, thus increasing the welcoming strain of Europe.
Following this more structured attempt to weaponize migration flows on the behalf of Russia and Belarus,the EU has decided to prepare an institutional response in the form of a new Regulation, to address this situation before this hybrid warfare causes further instability. This legislative effort would provide EU Member States, which are the most effected by targeted mass-migration, with normative tools to act in situations of emergency. Forthe purpose of the Regulation, the instrumentalization of migration occurs when non-EU countries instigate migratory flows towards the external borders of the European Union to unsettle the Union or a Member State. As such, the Regulation would introduce the ability to exercise derogations from existing frameworks(such as theReturn Directiveor theReception Conditions Directive), to apply emergency measures, such as determining specific checkpoints for access to limit the burden of people coming in, or to alter the procedure to register asylum seeker to streamline it.
This, of course, raises a series of political and institutional ambiguities. On the one hand, theRegulation’s definition of “instrumentalization” appears to be broad, which leaves an undefined room for maneuver for Member States to alter fundamental rights and procedures for migrants and asylum seekers. Such approach, ultimately, puts the people coming in at risk of an uneven treatment, by exploiting divergence from the rule of law. On the other, this Regulation has strong political implications, as migrants are judicially determined as a destabilizing force which leads to a strong sense of dehumanization. At the basis of EU migration policies, stands the principle of solidarity: to provide a uniform response that guarantees respect for the fundamental rights of any individual coming in. This proposal, instead, seems to be pushing towards a more auto-deterministic and securitarian approach, where the safety and security of the Union appears to be dependent on a harsher border control.
Thus, this leaves the European Union in a difficult position. On the one hand,the allegations of Russia and its supporters weaponizing migration flows to destabilize the EU appear to be confirmed. This, looking back at the political instability that a previous migration crisis brought, should serve as a warning for the potential repercussions of this form of hybrid warfare. Nonetheless,the current EC proposal does not seem to currently address many of the challenges that this issue poses. Rather, while emergency measures are necessary to address specifically targeted regions, such derogations from established rule of law could lead to confusion and rising tensions among European member states. Instead, what needs to be enforced is an increasing cooperation between Member States in regard to financial and humanitarian pressure, and a more defined legislative framework to set specific conditions under which such derogations can occur.
The threat of weaponized migration is, sadly,a reality that the Union needs to face. This de-humanizing practice, which instrumentalizes humanitarian crisis, and the struggle of innocent to gain strategic advantages, is a new way in which the conflict between Europe and Russia is being fought. As such, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of what the implications of such strategies are and also to maintain fortitude in addressing them. The European Union today is facing rising and complex challenges and Europe needs to ready itself to defend its safety and values by showing unity and strength in the face of humanitarian crisis.

Cemre Topal: The Lawyer Who Defends Women in a Country That Murders Them,"While the Turkish government is turning a deaf ear to the violence against women, many are opening their eyes to condemn it.
While the state is determined to oppress minorities, the resistance is getting organised and is not afraid. While Erdogan’s regime tries to silence the screams of women’s suffering, the voices of the opposition are rising up and shouting for their rights.
Among all these voices, one resonates even louder than the others. It is that of Cerme Topal.
A taste of struggle and a taste of equality is imprinted on her lip. On 22 November 2021 in Ankara, I encountered Cemre Topal. Lawyer, feminist, militant, her determination immediately struck me.
Born in 1979 in Adana (Turkey) Cemre Topal became interested in feminism very quickly and decided to pursue a legal career in order to defend women with the weapon of the law. She began her studies at the Faculty of Law of Anadolu University in 1997. In 2001, officially a lawyer, she started her career in the capital Turkish capital, Ankara, until 2008. Once in the workforce, Cemre realised the heavy weight of her gender in her personal life. In response to this violent realisation, she started to get involved infeminist organisations. She then became an active member of the Socialist Feminist Collective.
She is now working as a freelance lawyer in Adana.
As a lawyer, Cemre Topal quickly realised the magnitude of sexism and the violation of women’s rights within the law and judicial procedures. She decided to fight it! To counter the ineffectiveness of the government’s protection mechanisms for women, Topal and three other female lawyers decided to createtheGender and Law Studies Association. The stakes are high: highlighting gender-based discrimination in local courts. In addition, the collective unwavering commitment is to defend women victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. For more than 10 years, the association has been working to ensure that gender-based and sexual violence is condemned in the courts of Turkey.
In 2016, the organisation became prominent through its relentless defence ofÇilem Doğan, a woman who killed herabusive husband. During the trials that shook Turkish society, Topal became particularly renowned for her determination to save Çilem fromlife imprisonment.
While the language of the law defines the interactions that individuals have in society, the collective has focused on its sexist and discriminatory aspects. Indeed, in addition to dedicating their efforts to defend women victims of gender-based violence, the collective is now condemning the sexist language and behaviour present in trials for rape, femicide, self-defence, sexual assault, etc. “We were witnessing many cases of discriminatory language and behaviour in court. When a woman is raped, the judges find excuses to reduce the sentence for male perpetrators, while women who commit crimes in self-defence do not benefit from the same leniency” explains Cemre Topal.
In the very same way that Ruth Bader Ginsburg co-founded theACLU Women’s Rights Projectto identify legal cases of sexist discrimination in the USA, the collective has looked into the databases from the Adana Bar Association to identify the presence of sexist practices when meeting female defendants in the courthouses. The intention is both to condemn this implicit sexism and, above all, to make it public so that civil society can open its eyes to the reality of the legal world in Turkey.
“We wanted to reach out to people who can make a change in society. We wanted to use this data to advocate for reform and a change in mentality.”
The conclusion of this investigation was irrefutable. Indeed, the data showed many cases of gender-based discrimination. Frequently,the woman is not believed if the attacker appears to be a respectable person. Also, the data highlights ablame gameagainst women as to why they were sexually assaulted or subjected to domestic violence. Thus, in addition to not being recognised, women’s sufferings are often mocked and perceived as illegitimate.
“The system often tries to shift the blame onto women.”
Recently, Topal and her collective have been working to produce statistical data on femicide cases in Adana and in Turkey in general.
“Let’s start with the official number of women killed in this country. The one which the official statistics of the government have given is a false number. The government’s figures are systematically underestimated. The situation is played down. The number of women killed by their partners is exploding. We started to compile all the cases of women being murdered to try to have an exact number to work on and create a real database of the femicide in Turkey”.
Turkey has the sad reputation of being anopen-air graveyard for women. And rightly so! Although Turkey’s government does not keep official statistics on femicide, the WHO data has shown that 38% of women in Turkey are subject to violence from a partner in their lifetime, compared with about 25% in Europe.
Many activists that I have met denounced the AKP’s obstructionistpolicy on violence against women. For instance, not only are there no government statistics reflecting the exact number of femicides but also many murders of women are officially considered suicides. Therefore, the real number of femicides is misrepresented and minimised. It seems that the AKP disguises the cause of women’s deaths to absolve the responsibility that fell upon their shoulders.
As you read these words, at least 287 women have died as a result of male violence since the beginning of 2022 according to thewebsite Anit Sayaç.
“Women are alone and are killed with absolute impunity! When I’ll go home tonight, I’ll be alone facing the risk of being raped in the street or even killed publicly! Because yes, this is what’s happening here in Turkey!”
More than ever, Cemre Topal’s struggle is crucial to the survival of women in Turkey. In a country that ignores the suffering endured by half of the population, the Gender and Law Studies Association embodies an active resistance that reports on injustices and unpunished crimes. Given their relentlessness, the extraordinary violence suffered by women will not remain silent. Fighting, condemning and publicly denouncing; this is the struggle that Cemre Topal has decided to engage in with her colleagues. A war that must be pursued continuously in view of the exactions which persist against women in Turkey. “It is the resistance and the incredible solidarity of women that will conquer”, highlighted Topal.","December 09, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-second-voice/cemre-topal-the-lawyer-who-defends-women-in-a-country-that-murders-them/,Margaux Seigneur,thenewglobalorder.com,The Second Voice
Let’s Tune In: Taiwan’s Issue,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
The Chinese response to the US House of Representatives SpeakerNancy Pelosi‘s visit to Taiwan, the highest American representative person there since 1997, arrives. The People’s Republic of China decided that the right response was to halt the US and Chinese cooperation in several fields such as defence, justice, and climate change and to take several measures against Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family members, this last in accordance with relevant laws in China.
Since the division in 1949, China has always looked atTaiwanas a rebel province of China. After a civil war that had started before the second war world and that it will come at the end in 1949, the communist took the power, leaving the territory divided into two parts the communist incapable to take over the island without ships and equipment and Taiwan uncapable to take back the country.
TheUnited States‘ position over this “conflict” has always changed according to the needs of the US economy and security. Taiwan had been a US ally from 1954 to 1979. This latter year, the agreement between the Chinese Communist Party and the US marked an important change in the countries’ relationship in the Pacific. After the agreement, the US-Taiwan relationship changed, the US continued to have some unofficial relationships with the Asian nation, but the US was forced to recognize only one China and Taiwan as a part of it. Since then nothing has changed. The agreements between the US and Taiwan are always unofficial but the US behavior that is changing due to the new relationship/competition with China
Biden had clearly said that the US military discouraged Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan at the end of July butNancy Pelosidid not intend to skip it, because as she had said: “it is important to support Taiwan”. She has denounced several times the human rights record, met with pro-democracy dissidents, and also visited Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre. The visit was already planned for April but after she tested positive to the Covid-19 she was forced to postpone its journey.
For a few years, China has had a more aggressive attitude against Taiwan, there have been several problems at the Taiwan maritime borders, and what is new is that China is simulating aggression against Taiwan these days after Pelosi’s visit. This might suggest that the moment when China will invade Taiwan is closer than we think. China has never hidden its intentions, China has always said that it would have fought if it was necessary for the reunification of the Mainland.
Before Pelosi visited Taiwan, China swore consequences if the visit took place. Indeed, it is interesting to highlight that the Chinese countermeasures against the US are not either in the economic or the military field, even if they hit other sectors. According to several analysts, it is not the Chinese intention to start a war that China cannot win in a few days because of the high costs it can face on the ground and because of the crisis. The war could bring heavy consequences, because of the sanctions the world could put in place against China, such as the European Union and the US have done with Russia after it invaded Ukraine. The contemporary countermeasures, however, could be the last warning before the sanctions become economical.
Will China place further sanctions? Will the US change the way it supports Taiwan?

[EXCLUSIVE] Growing Pressure against the HDP in Turkey: Interview with Spokeswoman Ebru Günay,"On November 30, 2021, TNGO Director of Investigative JournalismMargaux Seigneurwent to the headquarters of the People’s Democratic Party (in Turkish: Halkların Demokratik Partisi-HDP) in Ankara. Accompanied by a translator and a photographer, she approached the highly secured building. Indeed, the offices of the HDP are regularly the target of deadly terrorist attacks. The most recent tragedy occurred on 17 June 2021 in Izmir where Deniz Poyraz lost her life after being tortured in the HDP building by a supporter of the far-right organization “Grey Wolves”.
Indeed, it was in a rather tense context that they entered the HDP compound. As the heavy steel doors closed behind us, the team was escorted by the security services. After passing through many doors that could be opened with codes that only a few people know, one last door opened. Behind it, stoodEbru Günay.
Elected deputy for Mardin in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in June 2018 on behalf of the HDP party, Ebru Günay is currently its spokeswoman. Politician and lawyer, she was notably involved in the defense ofAbdullah Öcalan. Also called Apo, the latter is currently held as a political prisoner for being one of the founders of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).  Ebru Günay was arrested in 2009 due to an investigation into the activities of the Kurdistan Communities Union and prosecutes during the KCK trial in which the defendants were accused of supporting terrorist organizations including the PKK. She was releasedafter five yearsin April 2014. In September 2019, the Turkish Supreme Appeals court confirmed her acquittal in the KCK main case in which more than 150 people were prosecuted.
Ebru Günay is notably known and recognized for her strong opposition to the ruling party and her determination to bring justice to the victims of human rights abuses. In September 2020 she took part in negotiations with European Union representatives regarding Turkey’s human rights situation. In June 2021, following the Youtube revelations by the Turkish mafia bossSedat Peker, she demanded an investigation into the depopulation policy against the Kurds in the 1990s.
Margaux:Since 2015, waves of purges have targeted the HDP resulting in the imprisonment of its leaders. In 2018, more than 26,000 HDP activists and supporters were imprisonned and this year, the courts opened the way to ban the party due to it is alleged affiliation with the PKK. Is it possible to continue your political work when you have to face the constant arrest and pressure from the ruling party?
“You have summarised very well what has happened since 2015. Indeed, since June 7, 2015, when the HDP first entered the parliament, the party has shown its opposition to the current regime in which only one man rules the whole country. From there, there have been violent repercussions on the party.The HDP is under a lot of pressure both politically and legally, with many attempts to bring charges against us before the courts. But has this pressure stopped the work of the HDP? Absolutely not! Because the HDP is the party that speaks for the majority of Turkey. It is the party that is the key to defending the rights of women and other minorities that suffer in Turkey we know today. So yes, the HDP is in a very difficult and sensitive position, especially with the Kobane trial in November. But the HDP has not stopped working. This shows that the party which is currently governing; the AKP, cannot finish us politically. Therefore, they are attacking us by all other means they have, including the courts, to hope to be successful in defeating us.”
M:When we refer to democracy, we are actually referring to the separation of powers; the separation between justice and politics. Does the fact that the AKP is using the justice system to arrest the HDP’s political figures show the failure of Turkish democracy?
“I can answer this question as a lawyer. Indeed, it can be said thatTurkey is becoming more and more of an authoritarian regime. In trials, the judges, the decision-makers, the members of the court etc. are not independent. There is no independence of the judiciary in Turkey. The government sends many judiciary members. Others are strategically placed according to their political affiliation. There is no neutrality or separation between politics and justice. On the contrary, politics uses the judiciary to eliminate the opposition.The judiciary has become an instrument in the service of the politics.”
M:You are indeed a lawyer by profession, you also took part innegotiation with representatives of the EU regarding the human rights situation in Turkey. In view of these elements, what is your opinion on the pressure exerted on the HDP? Are these political operations constitutional and legitimate?
“What is certain is that the status of democracy is no longer protected in Turkey, but above all is no longer relevant. We can no longer speak of democracy in danger because it doesn’t exist anymore. When we look at the background of the country, we see a Turkey that has withdrawn from the Istanbul Convention, we see a government that uses justice as a weapon of intimidation against the opposition. So we cannot talk about a democracy that is advancing, but about a catastrophic regression in terms of human rights, social rights, the economy, institutions, etc. “
M:Women are massacred, journalists, intellectuals, and Kurds are threatened and imprisoned. The LGBTQ+ community is prosecuted, and the Turkish economy is dying. This is clearly a record of the Turkish president’s failure. Yet, do you think the majority of the people living in Turkey are ready to vote in favor of a political change and so against the AKP?
“We are in a situation where every day two or three women are killed. The problem of feminicide is very real and extremely worrying. We are in a situation where killers are protected by the government. Rapists are often released by the authorities, who prefer to punish women.Kurds are imprisonedand oppressed. They cannot speak their mother tongues, they are massacred because of their identities. Kurdish women are raped with impunity. When we talk about society in general, people don’t have money to buy a decent life. We are talking about survival. The economy is in a catastrophic situation. So yes, I think we will see a change on election day. There is a real disconnect between the government living in a palace and the people surviving in miserable conditions. When people witness the degradation of their living conditions, I think they are ready for a change.”
M:In a recent declaration of yours, you stated that the HDP is the party representing the diversity within Turkey (women, Kurds, LGBTQ+, refugees, etc.) How is it possible to speak on behalf of all these voices that are so different from each other?
“We want the HDP to remain a historical party, but also a party which has great influence in the decision-making process in the parliament. We are doing everything to evolve with the times and to take into account the diversification that our society offers us. It is a party that wants to bring together all the diversity of the country and Kurdistan. One day we will be the governing party because we deeply respect the difference and plurality of society.We have a great strength because the HDP combines the power of the socialist and the Kurdish liberation movement. This represents a great unifying force. The HDP is a political party which aims to be open to all. There are conservatives, Syrians, liberals, Kurds, young people etc. In the parliament, we are the party that most represents the diversity of Turkish society, as well as the party with the most women. Thus, given this diversity and strength of representation, the HDP is ready to be elected and govern.How is it possible to speak on behalf of all these different voices? What is common to all minorities is their desire to have their rights equal to those of others and to have their status recognised and protected. Our job is to represent them, stand for their rights and condemn the violence they suffer. You can see us as a kind of platform that voices the suffering of minorities and protects them with our legal service that provides lawyers and legal advice when needed.”
M:Ebru Günay, as a woman and as a Kurd, was it difficult to assert yourself in the Turkish parliament? Did you face any sexist practices?
“Yes, of course, I had to face many difficulties due to my gender but also my identity. The AKP and MHP MP’s don’t mind cutting us off in the middle of a statement, taking the floor even if it’s our turn to speak etc. They try to crush us.What is interesting is that the parliament represents the people and we can see that the disrespectful and anti-democratic behaviour in the big assembly reflects what is going on in Turkish society. Minorities are repressed, women’s voices do not count and the political majority dictates with an iron fist the rest of the population.But at the same time, this does not discourage us because we are well aware that a large part of Turkey sees the HDP as the party of hope in the parliament. And so on the contrary, every time they try to silence us, we speak up. We have a resilience that goes beyond the intimidation mechanisms of the AKP. We speak loudly, we do not submit, we still defend ourselves and we will always defend ourselves.”
M:Can we consider that the Kurd’s question is a problem of division of people or of political division?
“The roots of the problem do not revolve around a division of peoples which would imply that Turks and Kurds cannot live together. The problem itself is purely political. Kurdish identity is not accepted. Many still say that Kurds do not exist. There is an absolute denial of the Kurdish identity itself. The language is not tolerated, and people are not allowed to speak their mother tongue. These are highly political issues. My statement of 27 October, to which you refer, is intended to bring hope that a dialogue will emerge to put an end to these identity violations. This issue of political division can only be resolved if there is a dialogue with arguments from both sides and if the voices of the oppressed are heard and respected instead of being silenced.The efforts of the current party to subjugate the Kurdish people have catastrophic consequences. The Turkish government continues to bomb, imprison, torture, and rape.It is high time to stop the policy of assimilation that the conservative government has been implementing for years. It is time for schools to teach their children Kurdish if they wish. It is time for people to express their culture and be publicly proud of it. It is high time that the government stopped its futile attempts to control minorities.For example, in my constituency in Mardin, the Ministry of Interior sent a person to govern us. This conservative employee is unable to govern the people of Mardin. Not only does he not understand the subtlety of our identity, but more importantly he refuses to listen to us. The result is that the population of Mardin does not accept to submit to the assimilation policies and thus, categorically refuses to obey the AKP power. So there is a real problem with democracy where the identity of the people is not listened to. Once again, this issue of the division of the peoples instrumentalised by the AKP in Turkey will not be solved as long as democracy is absent in Turkey and Kurdistan.
M:HDP has faced death, terrorists as well as political and judicial attacks. Could dialogue be enough in this context of survival and constant fight against the ruling party? Indeed, the HDP aims to establish a Democratic Republic. How is this concretely possible when you are a victim of the authoritarian excesses of the current regime?
“What will bring about a real dialogue is the people and their confidence in us. But we are not just going to wait for a dialogue to begin. On the contrary, we must provoke it. We must continue to meet people from all walks of life in all cities of Turkey and Kurdistan to hear their voices. We are going to meet the people so that they come together to communicate and talk about the problems they are facing. Throughout the summer we have been campaigning to promote the values of the HDP. For a long time, the HDP was only perceived as the Kurdish party whereas we are in all the cities of Turkey and not only Kurdistan. We are working so that everyone can identify with the values that the HDP stands for. We also work a lot in the Parliament to make their voice heard and to fight to make it resonate.
We are HDP and we are everywhere !
For example, on the occasion of the 25th of November (the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women), we were with the women to protest against the violence they suffer. For us, once again, we wanted to be present to support and strengthen the struggles of minorities so that a dialogue is possible. It is about creating dialogue, reaching out to the oppressed and making sure that their voices are heard. If through the visibility of the HDP we can contribute to a greater resonance, then our goal of dialogue is successful.”
M:Do you think that the pressure received by the HDP is institutionalized?
“They certainly are both in the political institutions, in the military institutions, and in the judicial ones. The current government is trying in every possible way to put an end to the HDP by closing it down. The government is trying to eradicate our party so that people turn away from us. But the problem is that the AKP has nothing in hand to finish with us both in the judicial and political aspects. They fail to have anything against us.During theKobané fights, many countries came with the Kurds to fight the EI except Turkey which refused to go and support the Kurdish side.On the 5th of October just before the beginning of the fight, Erdogan made a speech saying that Kobane has almost fallen. On the 6th, 7th, and 8th the Kobane event takes place. Kurds, intellectuals, and democrats come out in the streets to protest against the violation of democratic rights. Once again, to de-legitimize the HDP, the AKP announced that our party had incited the revolt by inciting people to protest in the streets. The police were sent to stop the protests. Dozens of people were massacred with impunity. Indeed, there was no trial or recognition of the murders committed by the state.Another mechanism to try to shut down the HDP is the stubborn trials against the HDP. In this trial, the AKP’s argument is to indict the HDP’s political actions without further ado. It is also a way to show the people that the HDP’s policy is not the right one and deserves to be condemned by the courts. This again aims to portray a dirty image of our political party even if they cannot prove it. It is also a way to fight the HDP. Because the government can’t fight us on the level of political debate, they resort to the judicial voice. This shows the despair of the AKP.”
“The HDP is oppressed by the current government and suffers from political and judicial pressure. There are always arrests of our leaders, deputies etc. The pressure is on but we have a strength of resistance that is not equal to any other party. If any of the other parties received 10 percent of the pressure we have been under for years, they would be over. With the history of the HDP, we continue to grow and strengthen. We are confident about the future.
The more the AKP tries to diminish us, the more we grow. The more the AKP tries to silence us, the louder we speak.”","October 05, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-second-voice/growing-pressure-hdp-turkey-interview-ebru-gunay/,Margaux Seigneur,thenewglobalorder.com,The Second Voice
Let’s Tune In: An Authoritarian Threat to Brazil’s Democracy,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
After several times Brazilian PresidentJair Bolsonarosaid he would not accept the result of the elections, he went on with further declarations these days which confused and scared thousands of Brazilians so much that they signed a manifesto in which they recognize the threat to their Brazilian democracy. Thousands of Brazilians protested claiming to Bolsonaro to respect their vote and the Brazilian people.
The manifesto was signed by a million Brazilians and was inspired by the historic Manifesto of 1977 which denouncedBrazil‘s 1964-1985 dictatorship. The manifesto has been enriched by the signature of bankers, business tycoons, three former presidents, and candidates in this year’s election. None had imagined after 45 years there would have been another manifesto that had to defend democratic institutions under attack.
Bolsonaro has always declared he does not believe in Brazil’s voting system made by electronic voting machines because it does not leave a paper trail. For this reason, a year ago Bolsonaro tried to change the electoral system by placing printed ballots papers but the Congress rejected his proposal. Bolsonaro did not accept this decision either. Instead, he continued to criticize the voting system also threatening that if he loses, there could be consequences.
What the opposition is afraid of is that Bolsonaro could do the same thingDonald Trumpdid in America and declare the October Brazilian elections a fraud. Inciting his voters to revolt. It is not news that he showed admiration for what Trump did and this could be a sign of what he wants to do. No less attention suscitated the glorification of the years of dictatorship as well as his meeting with Hungary’s autocratic leader,Viktor Orbán, and Russia’sVladimir Putin.
Notwithstanding the possible change that could be verified in the Brazilian leadership in October, this does not mean the Brazilian International posture will change because even if Brazilian President Bolsonaro visited Moscow a few days before Russia invaded Ukraine and he did not follow the West response to Russia, former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva currently the favourite candidate to the October Brazilian elections also does not approve the West response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
What Bolsonaro said about the voting system was dangerous and the civil society and elite know it. The Manifesto was and is a clear response to Bolsonaro’s criticisms of the voting system. This message has led the International Community and Bolsonaro himself to become aware of his possible defeat.
How will Bolsonaro respond to this Manifesto? Will Bolsonaro accept and respect the Brazilian automated election system?

Let’s Tune In: Mali asked for a UN meeting against France,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
In the past days,Maliasked for a UN meeting with United Nations Security Council President,China, because of several serious allegations against France on its territory. According to the Malian letter,Francewould have violated its air space several times, would have delivered weapons to the armed groups, and in addition, France would have used their air space against them to collect intelligence information for these terrorist groups. This last accusation is not accompanied by evidence.
On Monday there was the complete withdrawal of France forces from Mali, closing in this way what was the France mission called “Barkhane” which had worked for nearly a decade in Mali. The “Barkhane” mission was born in 2013 as an operation stretch to fight the insurgent Jihadist groups in the Sahel region. The “Barkhane” operation worked also in other countries of the Sahel region, all former France colonies. After the coup d’état in 2022, the new Malian government did not want foreign forces on its territory, precisely West forces. For this reason, the relationship between France and the Malian junta escalated.
France rejected the Malian allegations made about its involvement in the operation against the Malian junta and said they are satisfied with the “Barkhane” operation which guaranteed the safety and protection of a lot of Malian people and avoided the creation of a Caliphate on the Malian ground neutralizing the most important Jihadist groups present in Mali. At its peak, the Barkhane mission had 5100 troops among five Sahel allies, all former French coloniesBurkina Faso,Chad,Mali,Mauritania, andNiger.
Malian people look at the Barkhane operation differently. They see it as a failure and a part of it looks at what France saw as an opportunity for them to fight Jihadism by themselves and an opportunity to work on their security issues. Days after the French withdrawal members of the Russian Wagner group were notified in the North of Mali by UN German soldiers. The presence of the Wagner group in Mali is not new but is believed that the group would be training the Malian forces to face its internal threats.
Last week Putin discussed with the Malian Junta the possibility of delivering food, fertilizers, and fuel to Mali. Products that are relevant in the African region because of the scarcity of food, and the fruitless natural ground.
At the moment the Malian Junta asked for aUnited Nations Security Councilmeeting because of the already mentioned accusations against France without showing any proof. Interestingly, both the revisionist countries, China as President of the UNSC and Russia as Malian forces trainers, are involved in what is happening in Mali and against the West and a permanent country of the UNSC. What we are looking at, seems to be a change of influence from Western countries to Russia and this could open more instability in the country. What is relevant to highlight is the colonial past of a lot of European countries that helped create a big wall between the European and the African countries. An example is France’s forces cheered as heroes when they went to fight the Jihadist groups by the Malian people and now they leave it as a colonialistic influence that did not help the country.
Will Mali be able to give the UNSC the evidence of what they think France did on their ground?

Change or Continuity for the United Nations Security Council? An Analysis on the Institution’s Reformation Process,"According toRobert Cox (1987)“the world economic crisis appears as a threshold – a phase of transition between the definable structures of the recent past and the as yet unclear structures of the emerging future.” The United Nations (UN) is the basic international institution on which the current international system is built on. Since its founding in 1945, it has grown to be the largest and the most significant international institution, with 193 member states. It was created as the fundamental international institution of the new international order following the Second World War.
The only body within the UN with the power to adopt legally binding resolutions for the maintenance of international peace and security and to authorize the use of force when necessary is the Security Council (SC), one of the most significant multilateral institutions when it comes to influence global governance. According toArticle 24of theUN Charter, the responsibility of the SC is to maintain international peace and security. The SC can do this by acting onArticles 41 and 42of theUN charterwhich includes: investigating disputes potentially leading to international conflict, suggesting ways to solve disputes, and calling upon members to apply economic sanctions on certain members. The SC might take action through the use of air, sea, or land forces to maintain or restore international peace and security.
China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are the SC’s five permanent members (P5). Together, they account for approximately 30% of the world’s population and 40% of its economic output. In addition to the five permanent members, the General Assembly elects 10 non-permanent members to two-year terms.
The council often convenes in the UN building on the East River in New York, but it has more influence and power than the rest of the vast institution. It is predicated on the idea that the five most powerful countries have a responsibility to protect the world. These five permanent members were giving the status of ‘the most power countries in the world’ as a result of the role the played as victors in WWII. The UN Security Council accords the most powerful nations special rights and obligations while maintaining the majority of the UN structure’s insistence that member states are equal.  As such, this article will evaluate why the structure of the SC has not been modified and thereby review various reformation ideas of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
Any reform to the Security Council would requirethe agreement of at least two-thirds of UN member states in a vote in the General Assembly and must be ratified by two-thirds of Member States.A change in the Security Council requires the consent of all of the permanent members of the UNSC. Consensus-building has proven to be one of the institution’s most challenging problems which makes changing the SC’s structure more difficult. States that are eager to secure permanent representation on the Council include emerging African nations, like Nigeria and South Africa, as well as countries like Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. However, for this to happen, an agreement between UN member states and SC council members, particularly theP5, is necessary.
To alter the fundamental properties of the UNSC, namely its size, composition, the majority threshold, or the P5 veto, the UN member states have toamendArticles 23 and 27of theUN Chartercollectively. There are two methods for doing this. First any UNSC reform must be ratified by two-thirds of the members of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), including each of the P5. As an alternative, according toArticle 109, a conference of UN member states may be called by two-thirds of the UNGA membership and nine of the 15 UNSC members. If ratified by two-thirds of the UNGA and all permanent members, any amendment adopted there becomes effective. With 193 member states, 129 votes are required to reach a two-thirds majority. Accordingly, a blocking minority of 65 UN members is possible. To date, UN member states have amended the UN Charter three times on the basis ofArticle108, notably to increase UNSC membership from 11 to 15. However,Article109has never been used.
Regional representation, the problematic function of the veto held by the P5, the size of an enlarged Council and its working procedures, and the connection between the Security Council and General Assembly, are the main concerns covered by UNSC reform.
On March 21, 2005, Kofi Annan, the outgoing UN Secretary-General, called on the organization to agree to expand the council’s membership to 24 members and offered two options. The original proposal was for 24 seats in the council to be filled by three new non-permanent members and six new permanent members. The second strategy called for the creation of eight new seats in a new class for members, who would hold those positions for four years with the possibility of renewal, plus one non-permanent seat, for a total of 24 seats. But these plans have yet to achieve any progressive motion of support as there has been no consensus on the agreement to date.
However, there has been a proposed change to admit the G4 (Germany, Brazil, India, and Japan) as permanent members.
In 2005, Germany drew up a draft resolution for Security Council reform together with India, Brazil and Japan (G4). The draft consists of the following elements: adding six new permanent members to the Security Council (two seats each for Asia and Africa and one seat for the Western European and others group and the Latin American and Caribbean Group respectively); and adding four or five non-permanent members to the Security Council (one seat each for Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and one or two seats for Africa) making it a total of 25 members.
The General Assembly on the11th of July 2005, debated on the proposed draft resolutionby the G4 on the issue of reformation of the SC. The proposal included the General Assembly increasing the membership of the SC from 15 to 25 to reforming the SC on issues of enlargement, the right of veto, and equitable geographic representation. However, the draft resolution has not been adopted.
On September 14, 2015, despite resistance from the opponents to reform, a first framework outlining all positions on reform was unanimously adopted for consideration by the 70th session of theGeneral Assembly (69/560). The aim remains to use the document as a basis for negotiations on a concrete text to facilitate the transition from the repetition of well-known positions to real negotiations on a text, the usualmodus operandiin the UN. On September 23, 2020, the G4 gave a ministerial joint press statement and they reprised to continue working together, along with working alongside other reform-minded members to update the UNSC.
The primary issue with the Security Council has frequently been identified as the existence of veto power for the P5 of the SC, specified inChapter Vof theUN Charter. A veto can prevent a resolution from being enacted or change the resolution’s text. This has frequently prevented the council from discussing crucial global issues and given the P5 considerable influence across the global sphere of international politics.
For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on most major Cold War conflicts, including theVietnam Warand theSoviet-Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine or Iran’s suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the vetos.
The veto may also be used to block any UN charter modifications as well as the appointment of the UN Secretary-General. This authority has been discussed during the SC’s reconstruction. There are several proposals, such as restricting the use of the veto to matters of vital national security, requiring consensus from several states before using the veto, eliminating it altogether, and starting the transition process outlined inArticle 106of theCharter, which calls for the consensus principle to remain in place. Ironically, the P5 will need to approve any veto reform asArticles 108 and 109permit the exercise of the veto against any revisions to theCharter.
Any restructuring of the UN Security Council must consider the current balance of economic and military power. Developing countries must be represented, and their security interests must be reflected in the body, in light of the current changes in the international community. Simply put, the reformation of the SC is advocating for a more representative council, a more democratic council, and a council that is more reflective of the contemporary geopolitical realities of the emerging world.

Let’s Tune In: The US retaliates to attacks in Syria,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
On Wednesday,United Statestroops stationed in the South ofSyriaattacked bunkers inDeir el-Zorprovince after a Syrian attack. TheseUnited Statesattacks took place because of the aggressions theUnited Statestroops were subjected to last week. theUnited Statesthinks the attacks have been made by the Tehran-backed militias even if the Iranians denied it.
Syriahas been an unstable country since the “Arab Spring“, which brought the waves of protests that hit theMiddle Eastin 2011. The Syrian leaderBashar al-Assadseemed destinated to lose power since that period but the revolution has never succeeded even if a part of its territory, known asRojava, has become an autonomous region ofSyriasince 2012. The war effects inSyriawere catastrophic because of the strength of the revolution, according to several sources, the numbers say that this war caused 100.000 victims since 2013, and 4.9 million people escaped from the violence inJordan,Lebanon,Iraq, andTurkey.
TheUnited States military-military operation inSyriais officially aUnited States-ledGlobal Coalition to defeat ISISthat began in 2014.  At first, it was an operation against terrorism. It then became an operation that had to assure ISIS would not come back, a lower rate of violence, and look at Assad’s violations ofhuman rights. The mission could and can count on 900 American soldiers, an army that was built for defeating ISIS. This is the goal of a global alliance but also the expected outcome of an alliance between theUnited Statesand the People’s Protection Units International(YPG), part of the Autonomous region army inSyriawhich allowed theUnited Statesto “work” on “its” territory.
The American presence on the Syrian ground is a problem for several countries in the region as Iran and Turkey but it is also an annoyance for Russia. Iran criticized that theUnited Stateshad not answered its nuclear proposal, yet last week it called for theUnited States’withdrawal from the Syrian country due to the fact Iran says that its mission is a violation of the Syrian sovereignty as none of the recognized governments invited them to be there. Turkey, instead, is afraid of theUnited States’alliance with the People’s Protection Units International due to the fact it is a clone of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) which Turkey designates as a terrorist party. Russia is interested in the stability of the region more than anything else and Russia thinks a change in the leadership could lead to new instability in the region, for this reason, they support Assad in its operation.
TheUnited Statesoperation does not seem to come to an end, after defeating ISIS the mission found other goals, but with the weakness of the historic allies in the region, Israel, the Middle East is always more unstable from theUnited Statespoint of view. At the moment the region is under a Shia hegemony led by Iran, an armed and almost nuclear country helped by Russia interested in the order of the region and watched by Turkey, this last interested to limit Kurds in its territory and is scared they could organize a rebellion at the borders in the “Autonomous” region in Syria.
Is it sound for theUnited Statesto continue to advance its efforts? Did theUnited Statesoperation turn into a military outpost?

Let’s Tune In: Europe’s Most Important Gas Pipeline Closes Again,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
After three days in which the North Stream pipeline was closed because it needed repairs,Gazpromannounced theNord Streamwould have been closed due to the unexpected worst technical malfunctions. The decision has been taken by Gazprom andRussia’s industrial regulatorRostekhnadzor. It is not the first time that the pipeline was shut down because it has been closed for 10 days in July and after that intervention, its operativity has not gone beyond the 20% of its capacity.
TheNord Streampipeline stretches 1.200 km and it connectsRussiaandGermanycrossing the Baltic Sea. The project started in 1997 to facilitate the gas connections betweenRussiaandEurope, but another reason was to facilitate the negotiations betweenRussiaand the West because the threats of repercussions implemented by Eastern Europe made them difficult. In the end, theNord Streamwas inaugurated byAngela Merkel,Dmitrij Medvedev, andFrançois Fillonon the 8th of November in2011atLubmin. It has worked well since that moment and it can send a maximum of 170 million cubic meters of gas per day fromRussiatoGermany.
According to Russian authorities andGazprom, the technical malfunctions would have been caused by West sanctions which did not allow the necessary adjustments needed by Russian infrastructures. Since July, the gas pipeline has been operating at reduced capacity because of the shutdown of several gas turbines, and for this reason, the flow has never been the same. WhatRussiahighlights is that several turbines have been sent to Montreal and they were stuck because of the sanctions. Only one of those sent returned toGermany, causing a stir and it was also refused by Russian authorities because of irregularities in the documentation.
The shutdown arrived after the decision made by theG7of applying a “cap price” to Russian products, a price decided on a range of technical inputs by the countries of the coalition. This decision has been made because theG7does not want Russia to pay the cost of the war with the revenue of its products. From its side,Russiasimply refused to sell its gas to countries that will accept the “cap price” on its products.
GermanyandEuropeare facing a very difficult period in which its economy is deteriorating. Europe went from the imminent opening of a new gas pipeline,North Stream 2, that would have guaranteed important economic growth forEuropeandRussiato the closure of theNord Stream, forcing Europe to a big change in their gas market and not only in that. and with the implementation of the West sanctions againstRussia, because of its invasion.Germanyhad already said how important was the infrastructure forEuropeand its economy, and for this reason, when there were the first problems with the pipelineGermanyasked for the Canadian’s help inNord Streamturbine repairing, regardless of the sanctions. This weekGermanysaid the problems related to the three days of the planned shutdown of the pipeline would not have been felt by the people and the stakeholders but if this problem had been extended, as happened, there would have been more severe consequences.
After theG7decided on the “cap price” on Russian products arrived the news that theNord Streamwould have been closed due to an oil leak in a turbine without stressing when it would start working again. The dependency on Russian gas is important fromEurope‘sperspective and the same from the Russian point of view, but ifRussiawould have accepted what was happening and its partners would have accepted the “cap price” the Russian crisis and war would have been compromised.
What will happen next with Gas distribution in Europe? How much will European lifestyle change?

(Analysis) A Grand Chess Game: The Russo-Ukraine Conflict’s Impact on China’s strategy toward the EU,"In his 1904 article,The Geographical Pivot of History, British geopolitical Halford Mackinder raised theHeartland Theorythat described the Eurasian continent as aWorld Island. Later in his 1919 book,Democratic Ideals and Reality, he developed this theory and gave his famous syllogism:who rules East Europe commands the Heartland, who rules the Heartland commands the World Island, and who rules the World Island commands the world. Coincidently, Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former United States National Security Advisor for the Carter administration, in his 1997 book,The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, likens the Eurasian continent to a chessboard. In his book, Zbigniew reminds American foreign policymakers of the importance of the principal geopolitical pivots on the Eurasian chessboard to maintain U.S. global hegemony. Mackinder’s and Brzezinski’s works are the classics of land power theory compared to Alfred Mahan’s sea power theory.
The motivations of both scholars to raise the idea of land power is to remind their governments, the U.K. and the U.S., two sea powers, to be alert about the rise of land powers. Ukraine, as a buffer state and a bridgehead between Europe and Russia, in Mackinder’s and Brzezinski’s eyes, is one of the principal geopolitical pivots and plays a significant role in land and sea power competition. Because of the importance of Ukraine in geopolitics, as it connects Europe and Asia and controls (Odesa) the north of the Black Sea, the Russo-Ukraine conflict today has caused a structural change to the balance between great powers. As such, the aim of this article is to study China’s strategy toward the EU from a perspective of land and sea power competition, showcasing the structural changes in China’s strategy toward the EU.
To understand China’s strategy toward the EU, we need to put it into the context of theSino-U.S. competition, a classical land & sea power competition. One part of the U.S.’s strategy to contain the rise of China is to drive a wedge between the EU, many of which are traditional land powers, and China. China understands this very clearly and tries hard to avoid this situation. Trump’s “American first” foreign policy was a strategic opportunity for China.China’s endeavor to win over the EU was quite successful as “America First” was the primary strategic principle during the Trump administration.
When then-President Trump launched trade wars with both the EU and China at the same time, the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement of Investment (CAI) wasconcludedin principle on December 30, 2020, which the Biden administrationlobbiedto block. To achieve this agreement, China made concessions to commit to a greater level of market access for EU investors than ever before, including offering to eliminate joint venture requirements and forced transfer of technologies. The reason why China was willing to make major concessions was that China aimed to use CAI to build a closer economic tie with the EU to avoid the U.S.’s long-term isolation strategy. However, China’s strategy toward the EU was forced to adopt a new situation when Russia invaded Ukraine. The Russo-Ukraine conflict re-rouses the geopolitical “specter” in the Eurasian continent.
The Queen’s Gambit is one of the oldest openings in international chess. As Sean Marsh puts it inThe Batsford Book of Chess, “the Queen’s Gambit is a strategy by White to try and occupy the center of the board… White is offering a temporary pawn sacrifice to try to tempt Black into giving up the center.” If Ukraine is the geopolitical center of the chessboard, as described by Brzezinski, then Russia’s “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine on February 24thcan be viewed as a strategy of the Queen’s Gambit that saw Putin try to take the initiative in the great game of power politics. China, a state at the Eastern end of the “chessboard,” is a target that Russia aims to rope in. In a binary worldview of the West, especially democracy vs. autocracy, China has usually been viewed as an ally of Russia. However, China’s foreign policy is deeply rooted in anon-alignmentpolicy in practice which allows China to have more diplomatic room without restriction from its allies’ interests and ideologies. Thus, China and Russia may share many strategic interests, but they are not allies. In addition, in an environment of confrontation between China and the U.S., it is not in China’s interest to make alliances or get other countries to choose sides.
Nevertheless, Russia’s “Queen’s Gambit” strategy puts China in an awkward position. As we know, President Putin visited Beijing on February 4th, 2022, to take part in the opening ceremony of the XXIV Olympic Winter Games which wasboycottedby many western countries in the name of the human right situation in Xinjiang. During this visit, President Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed aJoint Statementdeclaring that “the friendship between the two states has no limits and that there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” 20 days after signing the statement, Russia invaded Ukraine.
President Putin betted that China needed Russia’s cooperation as the U.S., with its allies, is putting more pressure on China comprehensively. President Putin’s calculation was not entirely wrong.The coalition of China and Russia, as Brzezinski foresaw, is an anti-hegemonic coalition united by complementary grievances to the U.S. However, Russia’s attitude is not the only thing that China needs to take into consideration. On the one hand, China does believe that the enlargement of NATO, as the provision of joining NATO that was enshrined in theUkrainian Constitutionin 2019, is a security threat to Russia. This idea becomes especially true for the Chinese leadership as the US attempts to upgrade the Quad and AUKUS into anIndo-Pacific version of NATO. China was also mentioned in the NATOStrategic Conceptpaper as a systematic challenge for the first time at the 2022 NATO Summit.
On the other hand, China’s diplomacy is based on theFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity are cornerstones of the PRC’s foreign policy since its foundation. As China itself has the sovereignty claim over Taiwan; Russia recognizes Donetsk and Luhansk regions as two independent states doubtlessly violating China’s territorial integrity principle. Therefore, China will not recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk without Ukraine’s consent just as it did not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimean in 2014. Last, but most importantly, China does not want to further jeopardize its relationship with the EU because of Russia’s “Queen’s Gambit” and wants to avoid a situation where the EU fully stands with the U.S. in the Sino-U.S. competition. Thus, through many diplomatic channels, China tries to keep communicating with the EU and defend its neutral position in the Russo-Ukraine war.
The most remarkable geopolitical impacts caused by the war in Ukraine are a tightened relationship between the U.S. and the EU and a tightened relationship between China and Russia. The Biden administration intends to use the Russo-Ukraine conflict to restore American military influence in Europe and the “revival” of NATO is one example. The “revival” of NATO is an inverse status of “becoming brain-dead” which was described by French President Emmanuel Macron when he proclaimed it in an interview in 2019. The idea of “becoming brain-dead” was raised in the context of the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of a1987 nuclear treatywith Russia which the EU considered itself the biggest victim. In aninterviewwithEurope 1, President Macron showed the EU’s ambition for strategic autonomy in self-defense and claimed to build a real security dialogue with Russia. “We [the EU] must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the U.S.’’
However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February broke the EU’s illusion of self-defense. The war consolidated the predominant status of the U.S. in NATO and its military influence among the EU member states. Second, the Russo-Ukraine conflict exposes the weakness of the Euro currency and the lack for strategic and defensive autonomy.Many countries believethat today’s US government is abusing its dollar hegemony and weaponizing it to practice long-arm jurisdiction and interfere with their domestic issues to promote American national interests. For this reason, many Global South countries,including China, consider the Euro as a substitution for the U.S. dollar in the global financial market.
On March 1st, the EU, U.K., Canada, and the U.S. made anagreementto remove seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system. The EU’s financial sanctions on Russia exposed the Global South countries’ worry that they may be sanctioned one day if their behaviors violate the West’s values. Therefore, many countries have begun to internationalize their own currency to avoid the financial hegemony of the West. For instance, China introduced its own Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS). Nevertheless, every single currency other than Western currencies is still veryweakin the global market. Thus, some Global South countries, such as BRICS member states, decided to developa new reserve currencyto promote Global South countries’ influence in finance.
For Russia, because of the heavy economic and financial sanctions imposed by the West, it was forced to build a closer relationship with non-western countries such as China and India. From China’s perspective, a tightened relationship with Russia is a strategic opportunity as well as a challenge as there are political hurdles between China and Russia that need to be removed, at least in the short to medium term. One example is Russia’s tacit approval of the construction of theChina-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan (CKU) railway. The CKU railway, as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), aims to build a close-knit Eurasian relationship. The negotiation for the project can be traced back to 1997.
However, the negotiation was thwarted by Russia in the past 25 years because Russia considers the five Central Asian countries within its own sphere of influence.The construction of the CKU railway will bring the economic influence of China into Central Asia, thereby reducing the dependence of the Caucasus five countries’ dependence on Russia. In addition, the completion of the CKU railway can help China diversify its trade route to connect the Middle East and Europe without passing through Russian territory which will reduce Russia’s strategic importance in geopolitics in a long term. Nevertheless, the disadvantages on the battlefield of Ukraine, and theKazakh unrestinterrupted earlier this year, promoted President Putin’s nod on the construction of the CKU railway.
However, an ambiguous relationship with Russia is also a challenge to China that will inevitably deteriorate its already-struggled relationship with the EU. On March 22, 2021, both the EU and China put sanctions on each other over the issue of human rights in Xinjiang. The reciprocal sanctions resulted in a permanent suspension of CAI’s approval. On November 18, 2021, Taiwan opened a representative office in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, under the name of “Taiwanese Representative.” In the past, the Republic of China, the official name of Taiwan, usually sent a “Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office” in countries without an official diplomatic relationship. The Taiwanese Representative Office in Vilnius is the first office globally that Taiwan has in the name of Taiwan. Beijing views the opening of the representative office as an action to hollow out theOne China Principleand a salami-sliced recognition of Taiwan as an independent country. Because of this, Beijing demanded Lithuania to withdraw its ambassador and recalled its own ambassador to Lithuania. On the EU side, however, Brussel believes that Beijing’s actions were coercive diplomacy.
Obviously, the Russo-Ukraine conflict exaggerates the disagreements between the EU and China. On February 26th, 2022, China chose to stay neutral andabstainedfrom voting in the UN Security Council to condemn and put sanctions on Russia. However, China maintains its economic connection with Russia which is viewed by the EU as a way to help Russia avoid Western sanctions.
On April 1, 2022, at the EU-China summit, the EU tried to make an agreement with China on the issue of the Russo-Ukraine conflict, although China did not respond to the EU’s request. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbing, explained that “China has always independently assessed the situation on the basis of the historical context and the merits of the Ukraine issue. We have always stood on the side of peace and justice.”  Later the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy concluded the EU-China summit asa dialogue of the deaf. Estonia and Latvia, and previously Lithuania, stepped out of the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (China-CEEC).
Even though the Russo-Ukraine conflict enlarges the disagreements between Sino-EU relations, China does still believe that the common interests between the latter is still greater than the disagreements. The first common interest is that both China and the EU are aiming at a cease-fire in Ukraine. The reason why China refused to put sanctions on Russia, other than its strategic consideration, is that the Chinese leadershipbelievethat sanctions will not be able to end a war, instead only enlarging the disagreement and hatred. China does not seek to utilize the Russo-Ukraine conflict to defeat or impair either side. Ukraine may win on the battlefields and even a regime change may happen in Russia, but all of these cannot change the geographical fact that the EU and Russia are neighbors.
In the end, no matter how this war turns out, unlike the U.S., all countries in the Eurasian continent, including the EU, need to find a way to get along with Russia. The Chinese leadership expects the EU, rather than NATO, to have more autonomy on the issue of the Russo-Ukraine conflict. From a long-term economic perspective, the EU is the second largest trading partner with China, right behind ASEAN, and the EU is located at the western end of the Eurasian chessboard which should be integrated into the Eurasian economic entirety from a long-term perspective of a raising land power.","November 23, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-a-grand-chess-game-the-russo-ukraine-conflicts-impact-on-chinas-strategy-toward-the-eu/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In: North Korea declares its nuclear potential,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
On September 8th,North Koreapromulgated the law of the Supreme People’s Assembly of the DPRK the state policy on nuclear forces. North Korea officially refuses the use of these weapons and engages itself to build a peaceful world and a world where international justice is realized. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a record of nuclear weapons launches fromNorth Korea, there are 17 until now and they have been launched withoutUSAand UN concern due to the Ukrainian war priority acquired on this issue.
North Korean leaderKim Jong-unsaid on Friday:” “We will not waive our right for self-defence, which is crucial for the country’s existence, for the security of the state and its people, no matter how difficult the situation is,” he said. “Regardless of the political and military situation on the Korean peninsula, brought about by theUSA, we won’t reject nuclear weapons, because we need to deter theUSA, which is a nuclear power.”
North Koreahas always thought that nuclear weapons were necessary for its survival since the end of the civil war in 1953 when the division of the Korean peninsula became official and the peninsula was divided into the Communist North and the Capitalist South. Since that period nuclear weapons are seen by the leader ofNorth Koreaas a tool that stretches and guarantees the sovereignty of its territory.North Koreastarted its project in 1956 and slowly grew until today, a project that the nation has never needed because of the presence of US militaries and nuclear forces.
According to the North Korean statement on nuclear weapons, they have the aim to: deter a possible attack or aggression against them; win the war in case it begins. The statement also says that the composition of the nuclear weapons must be diversified and it must have different kinds of nuclear warheads, delivery means, command and control systems, and all the personnel, equipment, and facilities for the system’s operating and updating.
The use of these weapons is a decision made by the president of the State Affairs of the DPRK. As stated, these weapons can be used only if the country has to cope with outside aggression which attempts the North Korean sovereignty on its territory, and what the country cannot do is threaten non-nuclear countries around it unless they are engaged against North Korea with nuclear power.
TheBidenAdministration explained several times that it wanted to talk with Pyongyang but it has not happened yet. Biden was clear he wished to use with Pyongyang a mix of dialogue and “stern deterrence” and, for this reason, Kim Jong-un replied that his country had to be ready to talk and confront. On the other side, Putin congratulated North Korea on its anniversary and said he would be happy to continue its peaceful and essential relationship for good, in the name of North-eastern stability.
The North Korean nuclear project was slow because the countries which could help them were not sure of North Korean intentions, for this reason, neither the communist countries have helped their project consistently. Today, North Korea has its arsenal and the International Community hopes it will keep it safe and behave responsibly. TodayNorth Koreaand its regime are stronger but the situation in Asia is less foreseeable, and for this reason, more dangerous. Drawing fromBiden‘s words, the nuclear “autocracies” are growing and maybe there is a necessity for a new way of thinking and talking about nuclear power.
How will the subject of nuclear power change after the declaration ofNorth Korea? How will the balance of power change in the Pacific?","September 14, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/lets-tune-in-north-korea-declares-its-nuclear-potential/,Giuseppe Maria Bartalotta,thenewglobalorder.com,Let's Tune In
(Analysis) Tensions across the Taiwan Strait: Is the 1992 Consensus Permanently Lost?,"The relationship between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) is one of the most contentious issues in international politics. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers Taiwan, located only 200 kilometers off the Chinese mainland, to be anintegral part of the Chinese territoryand should be reunited with the mainland. Over recent years Beijing has sharply increased its military incursions across the Taiwan Strait. This has prompted the weekly news magazineThe Economistto name the self-ruled democratic island as the most dangerous place on earth in May 2021.
The “1992 Consensus” has long been regarded as the roadmapfor cross-strait political dialogue. The agreement signed in Hong Kong between the CCP and the Kuomintang (KMT) – the party that traditionally defends a Chinese identity across the island – provided both sides to agree on the existence of only “One China,” though the KMT insists that it can hold “distinct interpretations” of One China. The 1992 Consensus was first formally instituted under KMT President Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan’s president from 2008 to 2016. This political development sparked an unprecedented rapprochement, leading to the signing of agreements in the areas of tourism, trade and education.  It also marked the first-ever gathering of both sides’ leaders since the Chinese civil war, with MameetingXi Jinping in Singapore in November 2015 – roughly two months before Taiwan’s 2016 general election.
But in reality, the stability of the bilateral relationship brought considerable tensions across the ROC’s social landscape. Unpopularity with the younger generation who are increasingly concerned about the erosion of the hard-won noble values of self-determination and democracy achieved during the 1980s and 1990s openly protested in early 2014 against deepening cross-strait economic integration. For instance, hundreds of student protesters physicallyoccupiedTaiwan’s national legislature.
With growing disillusionment by young Taiwanese with the Ma administration’s CCP engagement policy, young activists were jolted to vote against the KMT in the 2016 general election, thereby leading to the election of Tsai Ing-wen and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) majority in the Legislative Yuan. In moving away from the engagement policies of her predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, a former academic, has sought to relegate relations with the PRC to the periphery in favor of greater ties with liberal democratic countries. This has led to unprecedented cross-strait tensions, resulting in the PRC conducting increasingly frequent military and cyber-warfare activities over the Taiwan Strait each year.
The 2016 presidential and parliamentary elections have ushered a new era in Taiwanese politics. As the first female President of the ROC, Tsai has consistently slammed the CCP on various issues, such as thesuppressionof basic freedoms in Hong Kong. She has thus become Xi Jinping’s bête noire, the impediment to his “historic mission” to reunify Taiwan with mainland China and erase the “century of humiliation” – period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing dynasty and Taiwan by Western powers and Japan from 1839 to 1949. As a result, the PRC has ratcheted up its campaign to diminish the ROC’s international standing by poaching its diplomatic allies, particularly in Latin America and the South Pacific.
In the face of the CCP’s multifaceted campaign to subvert Taiwan, the Tsai administration has sought to accelerate deeper bilateral military ties with the United States. The military relationship with the world’s leading superpower is indeed broad and deep, despite the commitment of several American administrations to the One China policy. Ever since diplomatic ties with the ROC were severed in 1979, the United States has maintained a political commitment to Taiwan under the rubric of theTaiwan Relations Act, which authorizes continued commercial defense relations between Washington and Taipei. American administrations from 1979 to 2016 have nevertheless sought to deal with the Taiwan issue with great caution and subtlety.
But amidst the CCP’s geostrategic quest to reorganize the Indo-Pacific region to its advantage, the Trump and Biden administrations have sought to strengthen security ties with Taiwan. There is the geographical fact that the ROC is one of the most important linkages in theUnited States’ First Island Chain strategy– a strategic blueprint for maritime containment conceptualized initially during the Cold War as the first line of defense to contain the expanding influence of the Soviet Union and its socialist allies in East and Southeast Asia. The ROC is the largest landmass between Japan and the Philippines, and thus anchors a chain of islands that American strategists have considered critical to containing the PRC’s access to the Pacific.
In working to deepen bilateral security ties, President Tsai notably held a cordialten-minute conversationwith President-elect Donald Trump in early December 2016 – an unprecedented move for a future American president to converse with the ROC’s top leader. A broader push by the Trump administration to enhance relations with the self-governing, democratic island then became evident when the American State Departmentapproveda $1.4 billion arms sale to the ROC during the Republican administration’s first months in office. With confrontation with the PRC a key pillar of Donald Trump’s foreign policy, with days left in office, his administrationbrusquely liftedAmerican government rules that prohibited interactions between United States and Taiwanese diplomats.
Joe Biden’s Democrats have upheld this hard line by authorizing American-ledmultilateral militaryexercises southwest of the Japanese island of Okinawa. Each backdrop has spurred the PRC to step up the scale of its military activity along the Taiwan Strait. After a series of major American naval exercises southeast of the East China Sea in October, the PRC notably responded bysending52 warplanes, 36 fighter jets and 12 nuclear-capable bombers into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone – testing the resolve of the Taiwanese military and the willingness of the Biden political team to respond. The Biden administration subsequently reacted by boosting arms sales to the Tsai administration: in June, the United States reinforced the ROC’s combat readiness byapprovinga $120 million sale of naval equipment.
More recently, in an interview with an American media outlet, President Bidenreiterated his engagementto defend the democratically governed island – the most explicit to date about committing American troops to protect the ROC.
Other senior level Democrats have held high-profile meetings with Taiwanese decision-makers. In August, House Speaker Nancy Pelosiconducteda series of political meetings with senior ROC government officials, making the Carolina representative the highest-ranking American government official to visit the island in 25 years.
The Tsai administration has capitalized on the growing rift between the PRC and European countries. Following the spread of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), the China’s diplomaticeffortsto publicize its medical aid, together with the aggressive diplomacy of Chinese diplomats in European Union (EU) member states targeting and exaggerating the difficulties of European countries in combating the outbreak and resolving the health crisis, have significantly contributed to an increasingly tense bilateral relationship.
Amid the volatility in the Sino-European political relationship, the Tsai administration has extended its diplomatic engagement with EU states. In December 2020, the Taiwanese Foreign Ministryannouncedthe official opening of a second representative office in Aix-en-Provence – which amounts in essence to ade factoconsulate. In November 2021, Taiwanopenedade factoembassy in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. In the wake of this event, the Tsai administrationpledgedto set up a $1 billion credit fund to finance Lithuanian projects to fend off the PRC’s diplomatic pressure on the Baltic nation. Taiwan and Lithuania are particularly considering enhancing cooperation across the semiconductor industry. The Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute (TSRI) will notablyshareits know-how to help the Baltic nation develop its semiconductor expertise.
The ROC’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, has conducted several bilateral meetings with counterparts from Central European countries. In October 2021, Minister Wuhelddiplomatic meetings with Czech and Slovak foreign ministers to boost cooperation on cybersecurity and green technology.
This dynamic is crucial for the Tsai administration efforts to legitimize its sovereignty and rebut the Chinese mainland’s assertion that Taiwan is merely a renegade province of the PRC. Behind the warm words, Taipei is hopeful that increased high-level contacts and cooperation will ensure that Western liberal democracies fulfil the ROC’s political aspiration: to increase its membership and participation in international organizations in order to strengthen its sovereignty legitimacy globally.
Behind the Russian Federation’s illegal and premeditated war in Ukraine, it is easy to surmise that President Xi will launch a swift attack on Taiwan – given the Pentagon’s immediate focus on strengthening the offensive and defensive military capabilities of the Ukrainian army.
Even though President Xi successfully ratified his authority for a historic third term following the 20th Party congress, an invasion of Taiwan would nevertheless be politically and economically perilous for the regime. In recent months, the CCP has been confronted with a significant decline in its macroeconomic results. Last spring, the world’s second largest economy experienced a spike in Covid-19 infection rates, leading authorities to tighten health measures. In conform with its “zero Covid” policy, main urban centers like Shenzhen, Beijing, and especially Shanghai, the country’s economic capital, experienced drastic lockdown measures. These restrictions to business activity, combined with a  residential property sectorat growing risk of collapsing, have had aheavy impacton economic indicators: youth unemployment (18-24 years) reached 19.3%, industrial production stagnated at 3.9% and sales dropped by 4.6% during the first half of 2022.
These weak economic performances have led the World Bank toforecast annual growthof only 2.8% for 2022 – the slowest pace in four decades – excluding 2020’s Covid crisis dip. A reunification war with Taiwan would carry the threat of severe sanctions from Washington and its allies, therefore worsening an already complicated macroeconomic environment, which could have profound social repercussions for the regime. It is worth remembering that the basis of the CCP’s domestic legitimacy since 1978 has been the generation of economic growth, which has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. A Chinese invasion could trigger an economic recession at home, especially in the China’s southern mainland economy which is closely intertwined withTaiwanese suppliers and capital, all of which would be decimated by a war.
Militarily, an attack on Taiwan would represent the most complex logistical operation in modern history, involving an amphibious invasion, which the CCP has never accomplished. A Normandy-like invasion would require a force of over1.2 million soldiers and many thousands of assault shipsto defeat a potential Taiwanese defending force of 450,000. During World War II, U.S. forces plannedOperation Causeway, a strategy that sought to retake Taiwan from 30,000 Japanese troops with 400,000 soldiers and marines.
To subdue the ROC military units, the Chinese navy and air force would need their first invasion fleets synchronized to strike the island’s beaches and ports simultaneously. Currently the Chinese military only hastwo amphibious assault shipsand many of its top ranked military ranked officers lack operational experience: of the first hundred officers in the Chinese army,only one held the rank of junior officerduring the disastrous invasion of Vietnam in 1979, the last major land war that PRC fought. The challenge is further complicated by the Pentagon’s decisionto deploy six B-52 Bombers to northern Australia, all of which are fully capable of launching an attack on Chinese territory.
Having bombers that could range and potentially attack mainland China could be very important in sending a signal to China that any of its actions over Taiwan could also expand further,
This does not mean that the CCP will envisage to sustain selective restraint. Following Speaker Pelosi’s visit, Beijing escalated air and sea military maneuvers across the Taiwan Strait in a bid to create a kind of new normal. Since the official end of these exercises, PRC warplanes have continued to cross the median line daily, usually indouble-digit numbers, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense statistics. Moreover, the PRCimposedvisa bans on many DPP political figures and suspended imports of Taiwanesecitrus fruits, fish and sand.
In the ensuing weeks, U.S. warshipscarried outfreedom of navigation exercises in the Taiwan Strait without challenge.
The bottom line is that the PRC will constantly seek to dissuade the ROC from declaring independence while striving to reshape Taiwan’s political landscape in its favor through coercive grey zone activities to instill fear and a sense of inevitability of reunification in the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese.
The PRC has spent years coercing small states for political and strategic gains. TheSolomon Islands,KiribatiandSri Lankaare prime examples where the PRC has leveraged its political and economic control over these islands. In Taiwan’s case, the PRC could extend its influence across the island’s political parties, government institutions and electronic communication systems to disrupt the progression of its domestic democratic political system. Over the years the PRC has spent considerable effort and money building ties with groups in Taiwan, from the once-ruling KMT toorganized crime.
This scenario will become all the more pronounced if the DPP remains in power for the foreseeable future or if the KMT considers rejecting the 1992 Consensus in order to make headway with the Taiwanese electorate. Since hisappointmentto chairmanship of the KMT in 2021, Eric Chu, has toned down his stance over cross-strait relations. In his official address marking the launch of thereopening of the party’s representative officein Washington, last summer, he characterized the “1992 Consensus” as the “No Consensus Consensus” – a phrase that elicited an immediate backlash from the KMT’s more traditionalist camps, as well as from the PRC. Growing ambiguity over the 1992 Consensus will increasingly push Beijing to step up its influence campaigns toward the hardline factions of KMT before the critical 2024 general election.
Chiang Wan-an, the great-grandson of former Chinese military leader Chiang Kai-shek, is widelyregardedas the PRC’s best hope for driving Taiwan’s volatile relations with the mainland in a new direction. It will be interesting to gauge whether he takes hold of the Party in the weeks and months ahead.","December 05, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-tensions-across-the-taiwan-strait-is-the-1992-consensus-permanently-lost/,Kareem Salem,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In: Iran joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
On September 15th,Iransigned the memorandum of commitment toward theShanghai cooperation organization(SCO) becoming a permanent member of it. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, the agreement will not be only a normal relationship among states but it will open a new stage forIran. It will have an important impact on the economy, transit, and energy cooperation. Its membership will be official in April 2023.
TheShanghai cooperation organizationwas founded in 2001 by six countries:Cina,Russia,Kazakistan,Kirghizistan,TajikistaneUzbekistan. Currently, the members became eight withIndiaandPakistanwith several observers among which there was alsoIran. The main goals of this Organization are several: promoting effective cooperation in politics, trade and economy, science and technology, culture as well as education, energy, transportation, tourism, environmental protection, and other fields; making joint efforts to maintain and ensure peace, security and stability in the region, moving towards the establishment of a new, democratic, just and rational political and economic international order. The Organization is one of the biggest in the world it can count on 44% of the global population and 30% of the global GDP.
Last year after the SCO acceptedIran‘s application for accession, theIrangovernment asked the SCO members for help in averting the sanctions on its nuclear program.Iranhas faced a very hard period since theTrumpadministration abandoned the deal onIran’snuclear program in 2018. The consequence of the withdrawal has been crystallized in the sanctions Iran has endured until now. these sanctions were divided into two tranches: an initial set of non-oil sanctions on 7 August 2018, and a second more significant batch on 5 November 2018 against over 700 persons and entities, including around 300 new targets.
After the Samarkand’s meeting in Uzbekistan in theShanghai cooperation organizationstatement, the SCO members ask all the parties in theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Actionto consider and respect the implementation of the Iranian nuclear program. The talks had already been opened by West members, and the same from theBidenAdministration, but whatIranhopes it is that with this statement there will be an important speeding up in the operation.
This is what the statement lays down: “The member states place emphasis on the consistent implementation of theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action(JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear program, and in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2231, they call upon all participants to strictly abide by their commitments towards the full and effective implementation of the document”. You can read more about it on the articleSCO calls for strict compliance with Iran nuke deal commitments.
Another important point to highlight by the SCO is the Indian attendance at the conference. This country has ties with West and Asian countries, it is in the SCO and the Quad and this does not help the members of these organizations to clearly understand the country’s intentions and its stands on a number of issues. To complicate things further, India is going to have: the Presidency of the United Nations Security Council in December 2022, the Presidency of the SCO in 2023, and the chair of the G20.
Nevertheless, the SCO was built on Asian needs and it is not a military alliance but an economic one. West countries, however, are afraid this could become a military one as happened several times in economic alliances during history. The fact that this organization has been joined by two nuclear countries asPakistanandIndia, and nowIranhas increased the anxiety about it. The organization is becoming huge and potentially dangerous for those who are not part of it, but some agreements could help them to start a project together and be more friendly to each other. The International Community hopes that the Organizations can work together and find the right way to communicate without prejudice.

The Current Political State of Zambia: Will Foreign Investments Be a Viable Decision?,"The economy of Zambia fell into a deep recession due to the adverse impact of the COVID–19 pandemic in 2020. Real GDP contracted by an estimated 4.9% in 2020, after growing by 4.0% in 2018 and 1.9% in 2019African Economic Outlook 2021. The reason for this trend is the unparalleled deterioration in the key sectors of the economy. The manufacturing sector saw a huge downfall as supply chains were disrupted, and the tourism and service sector was also affected as the investments as well as private consumption weakened due to the unavoidable measures that had to be put in place to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Mining output, which declined initially due to falling global demand for copper, is recovering amidst production disruptions in South America according to theAfrican Economic Outlook 2021. Before the pandemic took its course, the economy of Zambia was already experiencing severe macroeconomic challenges, which included high inflation, widening fiscal deficits, low international reserves, tight liquidity conditions and unsustainable debt levels.
The government has made efforts to deploy monetary easing in 2019 and 2020, despite the financial sector having not stabilized. Following the outbreak of COVID–19, inflation rose to 17.4% in 2020 and is projected to remain above the target range of 6%–8% in 2021African Economic Outlook 2021. In 2020, the external position also deteriorated and will remain through 2021 due to the output fluctuations, copper price, rising debt payments and elevated nonoil imports. The government’s pursuit of expansionary fiscal policy for public investments, despite falling revenues, has resulted in widening fiscal deficits (8.3% of GDP in 2019 and 11% of GDP in 2020)African Economic Outlook 2021.
The economy is projected to grow by 1.0% in 2021 and 2.0% in 2022, underpinned by a recovery in the mining, tourism, and manufacturing sectorsAfrican Economic Outlook 2021. The decrease in the cases of COVID-19 will further improve the activity in the tourism and manufacturing sector. Through all of that, the economy still faces risks that may surface through a second wave of the pandemic – this will slow down the global economic recovery and restrain demand for copper. The second wave of COVID-19 can also strain the recovery of the tourism sectorAfrican Economic Outlook 2021.
Another factor that can pose a high risk for the economy of Zambia is the failure to effectively implement the Economic Recovery Programme which has a mission to resolve nearly all the constraints the economy faces. These include stabilization of the macroeconomic environment and debt sustainability. In the banking sector, the ratio of non-performing loans is expected to increase and contribute to a drying up of bank liquidity, dampening private sector activityAfrican Development Bank Group. Against this backdrop, poverty is expected to increase due to significant job losses in the service sector (on average, 30.6%), manufacturing (39%), personal services (39%), and tourism (70%)African Economic Outlook 2021.
The state of Zambia is weak and lacks the capacity for administration in most rural areas. Between 2019 and 2021, political and economic governance in Zambia continued to decline while dissatisfaction with the status quo has increased as documented in theZambia Country Report 2022. Since the elections in 2016, mayoral elections and by-elections have been contentious and have recorded high levels of violence. There has been rising dissatisfaction in the country which has resulted in unrest. There are serious concerns about the capacity of the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) ahead of the 2021 electionsZambia Country Report 2022. The numbers of registered voters in each province were released by the ECZ. When these numbers were compared to the voter’s roll of 2016, it was apparent that there were more registered voters in 2021 than in 2016. These findings have caused increased unrest. The regulations put in place due to COVID-19 have restricted opposition gatherings, in contrast to the ruling party continuing to campaign through development projects, and state initiative which was branded as party projects.
During the period of 2019 – 2021, there has been increased unrest, and a clampdown on civil society and online activism in Zambia, this period was also the period in which theCybersecurity and Cybercrimes Draft Billwas passed. The closing down of the independent station Prime TV in 2020 has undermined the freedom of the mediaZambia Country Report 2022. There were increased arrests of opposition and civil society figures as well as arrests of private citizens for allegedly insulting the president on social media.
The journalism sector has been constricted since the elections in 2016. As the government has become less tolerant of dissent, freedom of expression in Zambia has come under strainZambia Country Report 2022. This can be seen through the TV broadcasting and most radio stations being state-controlled therefore they are heavily politicized. State-owned or state-sympathetic media reproduces the government’s line, often despite clear contradictory evidenceZambia Country Report 2022. Not only is this negatively affecting the media sector, but it also affects those who intend on investing in the country – the news in they receive is prejudiced in accordance with what the government wants them to know.
Although the economic state of Zambia may improve from the implications of COVID-19, which are underpinned by the mining, tourism, and manufacturing, sectors are recovering. Thepolitical positionand governance of the country which shows instability within the government and affects the citizens and country at large put investing in the country more of a risk than a life-long benefit.

A Tale of Two Countries: Dollarization in Panama and Ecuador,"Dollarization refers to the process through which a country adopts another nation’s currency, in this case, the US dollar, as a substitution for their own. In the Latin American (LATAM) region, there are three countries that have gone through this process: Panama, Ecuador, and El Salvador. The dollarization processes of Panama and Ecuador took place in different historical periods and responded to very different national needs and contexts. Despite their different starting points, both countries have maintained the U.S. dollar as their national currency to this date.
In the world of economics, the idea of dollarization does not have unanimous support. On the contrary, many economists warn against considering this option as an across-the-border solution. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that for these two countries, the strategy has been effective in providing economic stability whilealso having an important social cost, especially in the Ecuadorian case.
The factors considered when thinking about dollarization are many, as adopting a foreign currency force in the dollarized economy, will give up control of a state’s liquidity and exchange rates. On the other hand, this economic strategy seems attractive as it serves as a control for high inflation rates and encourages foreign investment by reducing transaction costs, while also reducing borrowing costs. It is important to note that these commonly mentioned advantages assume the lending nation to be exclusively indebted to the foreign investor, in this case the United States. In today’s world, however, that might not be the reality as countries, such as China, continue to offer attractive loans to developing countries including, but not limited to, the LATAM region.
Dollarization does not only mean introducing a new currency, but it also requires a certain degree of economic sovereignty to be sacrificed. Indeed, the U.S. dollar takes the control of currency production and monetary policy away from the individuals in government. For countries that have experienced corruption and institutional instability, this might be its most appealing characteristic. According to theInternational Monetary Fund, “the main attraction of full dollarization is the elimination of the risk of a sudden, sharp devaluation of the country’s exchange rate.” Nonetheless, the IMF explains that as the dollarized country loses its power to manipulate its currency’s value and depreciation, its competitiveness in the international market might also be affected as its products become more expensive and the local market becoming distorted.
Panama and Ecuador reached the decision to adopt the U.S. dollar as their national currency as they were experiencing very distinct moments in their history. In the case of Panama, the dollar became the official currency in1904, right after the country had gained independence from Colombia, and when the United States was in control of the Panama Canal. However, the country did not eliminate its national currency, thebalboa, which still circulates in the form of coins and in a restricted manner. In fact,balboabills circulated for seven days in 1941,after the governing president ordered their production before being removed from office. Consequently, the bills were also taken out of circulation.
In the Panamanian case, the decision to dollarize responded to a political strategy to facilitate and encourage the country’s bilateral relationship with the United States. Ecuador, on the other hand, made the controversial decision to adopt the U.S. dollar in the midst of an acute economic crisis, which had led to hyperinflation. According to Ecuador’s president, Jamil Mahuad, dollarization was the only viable solution.In January 2000, the U.S. dollar was introduced to the country with an exchange rate of 4,000Sucres(Ecuador’s national currency at the time) per dollar. By December 2000, the exchange rate had skyrocketed to 28,000Sucresper dollar. Different from Panama, the EcuadorianSucrestopped circulating that same year and was fully replaced by the U.S. dollar.
Ecuador’s history with dollarization shows much more social discontent than that of Panama. In effect, Jamil Mahuad was removed from the presidential office by social unrest and protests against the decision. The gap between those in favor and against the economic measure widened the already existing social and political crisis the country was facing and marked the beginning of the country’s biggest emigration wave to the United States and Europe. One might argue that the difference between the Panamanian and Ecuadorian social responses is based on the stage of national development. While Panama had just become independent and was in the nation’s forming stages, Ecuador had already been independent for almost two centuries, giving the country time to develop a stronger national identity and a history of bilateral relations and economic conditions.
Despite the controversy around dollarization and the consequences of its application, it is evident that in these two cases, it has been successful so far. Both Ecuador and Panama have maintained surprisingly low levels of inflation for the LATAM region, bringing stability to their economic systems and country as a whole. One must never forget, however, that as with many other economic policies, dollarization, and its process are far from a perfect fit, nor free of disadvantages, and should be used with caution.","November 14, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/ready-for-publication-a-tale-of-two-countries-dollarization-in-panama-and-ecuador/,Alejandra Palacios Jaramillo,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In: Russian Partial Mobilization,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
On September 21st,Putinannounced a “partial mobilization” composed of Russian reservists who will be engaged on the Russian territory, which is threatened by the European uptight attitude to “destroy” the Russian territory and its strength. In his speech,Putinshifted the meaning of the war from a “special military operation” to an existential operation that will depend on Russian unity and its strength. These would have been the words used by Putin in a Russian televised address. (you can read more about it in this articleRussia says 300,000 reservists are to be mobilized.
Since the beginning of the conflict, a lot of things have changed. After some months whereRussiaseemed to have control over several parts ofUkraine, this month has been horrible for the Russian army which has lost its foot in a number of Ukrainian territories.Ukraine‘s offensive reconquered 3,000 km of territory around the city of Kharkiv and its forces have also retaken territory in Luhansk, in easternUkraine. In total, Ukrainian forces regained 8,000 km from Russian control this last that still controls 20% of the Ukrainian territory, especially the Donbas region and the south of the country.
At the same time in line with what is happening inUkraine,Russiachanged its main war target which at the beginning of the invasion in February 2022 was the “demilitarization” ofUkraine, now resized to the annexation of the Ukrainian territories occupied. The latter was attempted with the “Referendum” call forUkraineto express their will for being part of the Russian Federation. The “Referendum” has been taking place in the separatist regions of Lugansk and Donetsk and the occupied city of Kherson e Zaporizhzhia and the people can vote until the 27th of September.
Indeed the territory regained by Ukrainian forces has forcedRussiato look inside its territory for new forces which could join the Russian efforts inUkraineso thatRussiawill be able to defend what it thinks will become Russian territory after the “Referendum“. In general, the losses fromUkraineandRussiahave been relevant in their deployments, respectively of 9,000 and 15,000 thousand and more than 5,700 among the civilians, but what it is important to outline is that according to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the decree signed by the Russian President will bring 300,000 new soldiers ready to defend the “country”.
Putin’sannouncement could not pass unnoticed. After he signed the “partial mobilization” in several parts of the Russian territory there have been protests. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, more people have been arrested and then others in Irkutsk and other Siberian cities where dozens have been held. The protests have not been the only response because a lot of people thought about how they could escape this situation looking for an answer on “Google” or buying a flight.
At the international level, the tensions seem they are not de-escalating due to: the G7 andUkrainecommenting against the attempted “Referendum” over the Ukrainian occupied territories, Stoltenberg being favourable to support moreUkraine, and the West’s thinking to go further with the sanctions.Putinfrom his side does not want to come back without results and, after some hesitations, he is looking to regain solidity at the international level using the nuclear threat to the West.
The partial mobilization does not seek to continue the war inUkrainebut to consolidate the territoriesRussiaconquered so far.Putinis sure the “Referendum” will give him new territories, and in this scenario, the new forces will be stationed in those regions which will be part of the Russian Federation. Once these regions become parts of the Russian Federation the new territory will not only be “defended” by the Russian army but also under its nuclear umbrella.
Will the “Referendum” be recognized by the West? How much should the nuclear threat concern the International Community?","September 27, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/lets-tune-in-russian-partial-mobilization/,Giuseppe Maria Bartalotta,thenewglobalorder.com,Let's Tune In
(Analysis) Australia in the Pacific: How can Canberra Regain Influence?,"The Pacific Islands region, located northeast of Australia’s east coast, is a vast expanse covering approximately 40 million square kilometers of ocean. Despite its remoteness, small population, and limited economic resources, the region has historically been the site of great power competition during World War II, this long stretch of ocean was the site of some of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific.
The post-war period, however, has seen Western powers, the United States, France, Australia and New Zealand, play the largest roles in the region. In Melanesia, notably, Australia has historically been the dominant power with Canberra’s policymakers have long regarded the region as a key aspect of its national security policy. In its quest for a prosperous and stable region, Australia has stood ready, when deemed necessary, to intervene unilaterally. In recent decades, Australian security forces have intervened in the Bougainville province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and, more recently, in the Solomon Islands, one of the poorest countries in Oceania. Honiara, which is about 1609 km northeast of Australia, saw a contingent of Australian Federal Police and Australian Defense Force personneldispatchedin November 2021 at the height of the Solomon Islands’ political crisis. Beyond the realm of hard power force projection, Canberra has been an important economic security partner for Honiara: in 2019-2020, Australiaprovidedover $174 million in official development assistance.
Yet Australia’s engagement with the South Pacific has been increasingly challenged by the growing influence of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In recent years, the PRC has scored several diplomatic victories across Melanesia and Polynesia: notablyconvincingHoniara and Tarawa to switch ties from Taipei to Beijing. With the Pacific islands region holding about7 percent of UN votes, the PRC has sought to deepen its aid and economic engagement to garner support at international fora – when Beijing was targeted at the UN Human Rights Council for the human rights situation in Xinjiang in 2021: Kiribati, PNG and the Solomon Islands respondedin supportfor the PRC. This dynamic has broughtconsiderable concernacross Australian foreign policy circles.
But Australia’s rising anxiety over the PRC’s growing footprint has not led to restraint from Beijing. Behind the scenes, Xi Jinping’s governmentsignedlast April a landmarked security deal with Honiara that might one day see a Chinese military outpost on Australia’s northern doorstep. In late May, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Foreign Minister Wang Yiscored52 bilateral agreements, advancing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the PRC’s standing as a reliable partner and viable alternative to other major powers in the region.
A PRC military outpost in the heart of Melanesia would allow Chinese warships to be based in the heart of Oceania and mark a major shift in the balance of power, if left unchecked. Although trade relations between Beijing and Canberra have tripled over the past decade toAU$110 billion per year, Chinese interference in Australian federal politics, combined with the PRC’s assertive military build-up in the South China Sea, has led to a downward spiral in bilateral ties, symbolized by the imposition of unprecedentedtrade sanctionsby the PRC on Australian export industries.
As the alliance with the United States remains a central element of Australian foreign policy, a Chinese military base would allow Beijing tomaintain a permanent surveillance capover Australia’s East Coast. With Australia seeking to establish its future nuclear submarine base on its Eastern Seaboard, a PRC base in the Solomon Islands could complicate transit between Australia and the United States, but more critically, allow Beijing to increase its power projection in the second and third island chains, bringing Chinese military firepower closer than ever to Australia.
Canberra still has policy options to limit the strategic gain of the PRC’s military ambition. A little north and west of the Solomon’s is PNG’s Manus Island, where an established Australian military outpost would be able to cut off the supply lines to a Chinese military base in the event of a conflict. This has happened before when the American, Australian, and Allied navies ran a large fleet from Manus Island during World War II, which effectively isolated the Japanese Rabaul military base from vital sea lines of communication.
In November 2018, Canberra and Port Moresbyreachedan agreement for Australia to upgrade PNG’s main naval base on Manus Island, the Lombrum Naval Base. The rebuilding and refurbishment of the military base would effectively pave the way for enhanced Australian maritime surveillance. Nonetheless it has taken nearly two years to begin themain work: construction of facilities for training, accommodation, patrol boats and small boat operations.
This is scarcely the most decisive response. Most notably apparent when one considers that the PRC has the world’s largest navy that possesses destroyer-type vessels that can easily upend the deterrence of these small-scale naval ships, which are best suited to enforce border controls, conduct search and rescue operations and chase illegal fishermen.
Discussions with PNG should be initiated for a more substantial redevelopment that would allow for the berthing of larger vessels. The momentum is there for this level of bilateral cooperation. The PRC’s heavy-handed approach to regional relations has caused considerable trepidation in the James Marape’s government over recent months.
In May, PNG was among the members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) thatstrongly rejectedthe Xi government’s push to sign a security deal. The Solomon Islands-China security agreement has particularly spurred Prime Minister James Marape tobegin talkswith the current Anthony Albanese government on a historic bilateral security agreement – the first since PNG gained independence from Australia in 1975.
As Canberra and Port Moresby seek tofinalizea new bilateral security deal over the coming months, a treaty-level agreement would help formalize and elevate the existing relationship, as well as open up the avenue to advance new opportunities for intensified engagement. This is an important development, one that would greatly facilitate the Albanese government’s efforts to thwart the PRC’s attempts to extend its hard power ambitions in Oceania.
The island nations, stretching from PNG and the Solomon Islands to Vanuatu, Fiji and beyond, are in urgent need of adequate sustainable investment projects that address their economic and climate security concerns. Over the past decade, the world’s second largest economy has made dramatic progress in extending its economic reach. Excluding PNG, two-way trade between Pacific island countries and the PRC hasovertakenthat of Australia since 2013.
The PRC has been particularly responsive to the urgent economic infrastructure needs and high-level trade of the region’s small island states over the past decade, primarily through its economic statecraft: the BRI. The Cook Islands, Fiji, PNG, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands have all signed up to Beijing’s flagship economic project. Most commercial investments by PRC state-owned enterprises are made in the form of concessional loans, with considerablyshorter repayment periods: 20 years for the Export-Import Bank of China (Eximbank) compared to 36 years for multilateral development banks (MDBs).
Over recent years, Australia has sought to counter the PRC’s growing economic reach through its Pacific Step-up Initiative. However, the previous Liberal/Coalition government’srefusalto take concrete action to limit emissions, combined with its attempts toresistinternational calls to strengthen fossil fuel reduction targets, has diminished Canberra’s reach in the region and made it more difficult to safeguard its enduring and critically important economic and geostrategic interests. In 2019, Scott Morrison, notably attempted tosoftena Pacific regional climate declaration. In the immediate wake of that bruising summit, Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimaramatold waiting mediathat partnering with the PRC was preferable to working with Australia. The PRC has capitalized on thefrustration and disappointmentof Scott Morrison’s failure to address these concerns by helping its state-owned enterprises secure renewable energy projects with the Pacific islands, such as the signing of a$1.1 million Lake Hargy hydropower plantin PNG’s New Britain province.
Amidst strategic shake-up in the Pacific: Canberra must clearly take the lead on climate action. In this respect, the Albanese government has taken a more proactive stance on this issue. Pacific leaderswelcomedthe current government’s new commitment to reduce emissions by43%by 2030 and its interest in co-hosting a UN climate summit with Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) countries. The issue of climate change was notably at the heart of the PIF leaders’ summitcommuniquéof July 2022. This was then capped by Canberra’s commitment to increase development assistance to the region by$900million over four years.
Ahead of the UN climate summit in Egypt, the Albanese governmentjoinedthe global effort to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, joining more than 100 other countries. Australia also showed climate leadership at the global event: Climate Change and Energy Minister Christopher Bowenco-chaired negotiationsto establish aloss and damage fundto help developing countries adapt to climate change –lauded by Pacific leaders. This was the first time in years that Australia had been given the responsibility for leading negotiations and facilitating an outcome.
Irritants have also surfaced over recent months when Australian Prime Minister Albanesestatedthat Australia would continue to export fossil fuels to international markets. At the COP 27 climate talks, the Australian delegationbacked awayfrom signing theGlasgow Statement: an agreement urging countries to end public funding to the fossil fuel sector. Australia is now the largest OECD country not to sign theGlasgow Statement, aside from Japan and Korea.
This development has caused significantdismayamong former Pacific leaders: Kiribati’s ex-president Anote Tong and Palau’s former president Tommy Remengesau Jr. have questioned Canberra’s engagement and earnestness in addressing this threat. Vanuatu’s PresidentNikenike Vurobaravuand Tuvalu’s Prime MinisterKausea Natanowent even further, becoming the first international leaders to call for a fuel non-proliferation treaty to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.
We, (…) unite with a hundred Nobel peace prize laureates and thousands of scientists worldwide and urge world leaders to join the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to manage a just transition away from fossil fuels.
The Labor government cannot risk abandoning the positive momentum achieved with Pacific leaders. In the South Pacific, the overarching effects of climate change are upending communities and affecting both human and traditional security calculations. Low-lying communities arefacing the prospectof mass migration as islands become uninhabitable. There are impacts on employment, resource availability, food security, and emergency services throughout the region.
For fragile states, there is a risk of total state failure – the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano in January notably destroyed decades of development on the island of Tonga.
As an integral member of PIF, Australia has the moral responsibility to use its international position to build greater climate action on the global stage. The Albanese government has an unprecedented opportunity to leverage Australia’s position in Oceania by driving a moratorium on new coal and gas projects. Returning to the Green Climate Fund and increasing renewable energy targets domestically and for export to international markets, including Oceania, now would send a clear signal that the Labor Party and Australia are committed to doing more to combat the negative impacts of climate change.","December 12, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-australia-in-the-pacific-how-can-canberra-regain-influence/,Kareem Salem,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In: Tragedy in Kabul,"Let’s Tune Inis a weekly column produced by our Newsroom team to highlight one story that you might have missed from last week.You can read more about our weekly content on the Newsroom page.
On September 30th, a suicide attack took place at the Kaaj tuition center, in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the western part ofAfghanistan‘s capital, Kabul. The attack cost 35 deaths and 80 w0unded, most of them women. The news comes from theUnited Nationswhich expressed its condolence to the victims. The suicide attack started with the killing of the guards in front of the education center and ended with the explosion inside.
The Kaaj education center is not the first private college, that teaches both male and female students, hit by suicide attacks. It happened also before theTalibantook over the country when a school in the same place was attacked causing 85 deaths and hundreds wounded. However, the problem that affects the country is not only a gender problem because there have been also several attacks against civilians in the same area that let the International Community think this is not the only internal problem inAfghanistan.
Several entities, among which theUnited NationsAssistance Mission inAfghanistan, noted that where the explosion took place, Dasht-e-Barchi, is the home of the “Hazara” minority who has often been targeted by the Islamic State (IS) militants and in the past also by theTaliban. However, the IS did not claim responsibility and theTalibanexpressed their condolences to the victims. A matter that complicates the situation is the fact that the majority of the Hazara community living in the area can be identified as Shia Muslims, making them also the target of Sunni Islam.
International public opinion is unified in the judgment of what happened there. Karen Decker, charge d’affaires at the US mission toAfghanistansaid: “Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear” (you can read more here). Moreover, theUnited NationsAssistance Mission inAfghanistansaid: “TheUnited Nationsfamily condemns the outrage, extending its deep condolences to all those in mourning” (you can read more here). In the end, it is important to mention what the Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Nafy Takor said: “(this attack) proves the enemy’s inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards (you can read more here).
After the suicide attack, protests developed against the silent “genocide” of the Hazara and the gender education inequality, principally formed by Afghan women, but this would not be accepted by theTalibanregime which would stop the protest using force. It is interesting to outline as there have been several protests also in its neighborIranwhere the protagonists were always women.
Afghanistanis facing several internal problems among which are ethnic and gender problems. The private schools were the environment where people thought the women and the Hazara community could grow but due to the fact this does not happen, the population, especially women, asked for a change and asked theTalibanto “stop genocide and the gender education inequality”.

Post Conflict Era: The Future of the EU Strategic Autonomy,"The longstanding wish of the EU is to achieve strategic autonomy, yet the U.S. has always maintained a wary attitude about it. The EU already accomplished market integration as well as financial and monetary integration but if it reaches autonomy in discourse, it will become a political force to the U.S. Moreover, if the EU achieves autonomy in security, it will put the US-led NATO in danger of hollowing out. Although the U.S. encourages EU countries to strengthen their discourse power and defence, it must be within the framework of “the West.” As a consequence, the actual process of the EU’s strategic autonomy has been challenging.
The Russo-Ukraine conflict that broke out early on in 2022, on the one hand, strengthened the EU’s determination to seek strategic autonomy and accelerated its pace. However, the conflict has also led to the EU’s further reliance on the US and NATO in terms of discourse and security, which is contradictory and difficult to resolve.
Since the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine conflict, the US has painted the conflict as a war of “democracy vs autocracy.” Under this narrative, the U.S. aims to create“the Other”to unite the world under its leadership. “The Other” is a philosophical idea established by self-consciousness that is used to differentiate the self from others. In political science “the Other” is a cumulative component of self-image that identifies other human beings in terms of their differences from oneself. Political identity and its identification are formed this way. In this narrative, Putin is described as adictator, with his regime being described asevil, and Russia’s military action asunjust. From this narrative, the West, or “the international community,” should be the guardian of the international liberal rules-based order.
The binary narrative of the West vs the Other has successfully influenced EU decision-makers and the European public. However, much of the rest of the world, specifically the Third World,does not buy this narrative. Instead of viewing this conflict as a great threat to global stability and the laws and norms underpinning the global order, it is interpreted as a regional conflict. Instead, these states believe that international efforts should focus on peace negotiation rather than using the conflict as a proxy war to isolate or weaken Russia.
Under this portrayal, the subjectivity of the EU is weakened as Europe is subject-positioned as part of “the West,” which is dominated by the U.S. Therefore, standing on the frontline with the U.S. on the issue of the Ukraine crisis becomes the only moral option for the EU.
However, it’s important to point out that the U.S. and the EU have clearly divergent interests in the face of the Russo-Ukraine conflict. For the U.S., the long-term instability in Eurasia is beneficial to reinforce Washington’s influence over the Euro-Atlantic region. In practice, the prolongation of the Russo-Ukraine conflict serves American national interests. For instance, the Euro is viewed as an alternative trading currency — even a challenger — to the hegemony of the U.S. dollar. However, long-term geopolitical instability in Eurasia makes the market lose faith in the Euro.
For the EU, on the other hand,regional stabilityis an important precondition to its economic prosperity and this cannot be achieved without responsible-continual dialogues with Russia. Today, there are manyarticlesopposing this argument and hoping Putin’s disastrous Ukraine war brings his downfall. A pro-western Russian regime is in the interest of Europe. Nevertheless, we should be aware that Putin was working hard forRussia’s membership in NATOin his early career stage. Putin was a pro-western politician. In other words, a regime change cannot really solve the problem. The fundamental conflict here is between U.S. and Russian interests — not the nature of the Russian regime.
From a perspective of geographic determinism, Russia is always on the east side of the EU, anddialogue is the only way to achieve a lasting peace. Because of this very reason, some European leaders, such as France’s President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, tried to opening a dialogue with Russia. However, theiractions, under the English-speaking media’s narrative, are viewed as “cowardly” and a “betrayal to democracy.”
The weaker subjectivity of the EU means the stronger influence of Washington — or the West — over Europe. There are many other signs showing that the subjectivity of the EU has been weaker since February 21, 2022. The first sign is the contradictory views betweenOld Europe and New Europeregarding how to face the Ukraine crisis. The idea of distinguishing Old Europe and New Europe was first raised by American political analysts. Old Europe usually refers to the former traditional Western European powers led by France and Germany. New Europe refers to the new countries that have joined the EU after its eastern enlargement, mainly the former members of the Warsaw Pact.
The Ukraine crisis offers a difference of outcome among European countries. Particularly, Old Europe does not exclude a peaceful negotiated settlement to the conflict while New Europe prefers to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty by force because of their history with an imperialistic and belligerent Russia. Another sign is the raising of many nationalist, populist, and far-right parties in each European country. One of themajor reasonsfor the victory of these parties was the higher cost of living that is being brought on by the Russo-Ukraine conflict.
EU’s political and economic integration has been fruitful for decades. However, in terms of defence and security, the EU defence industry is generally small in scale and uneven in development. Its arms development and procurement are even more fragmented, with about 80% of arms procurement done at the national level by member states.
After World War II, European countries enjoyed a long peace for many years by relying on NATO and the U.S. for security and defence. But as a result, defence and security have become major shortcomings for the majority of European countries. Strategically, the Washington’s idea of controlling Europe has remained unchanged since the end of the Cold War. Following the Iraq War, the U.S. differentiated the EU through the strategy of dividing so-called Old Europe and New Europe. To some extent, New Europe represented an important grasp for American control over Old Europe. Most Central and Eastern European and Nordic countries prefer to rely on NATO as a security umbrella and see the Franco-German push for EU defence integration as a means for both countries to increase their leadership in theEuropean security architecture. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. stands on the moral high ground, tying the EU to the American and NATO chariot.
The EU’s pursuit of strategic autonomy has a number of internal bifurcations and no unified compass. In the future, if the EU fails to improve its own consensus on the idea of strategic autonomy and lacks hardcore power — such as discourse power and military power — to deal with external influences, its internal differences will intensify and greatly deplete the momentum of strategic autonomy.

(Analysis) The Taiwan Policy Act: The Showdown between the US and China?,"TheTaiwan Policy Act(TPA) is the most comprehensive bill introduced by the U.S. Congress since the enactment of theTaiwan Relation Act, the foundational legislature of the US-Taiwan unofficial relation. Its contention length and integrity are more complex than the combination of theTaiwan Relation Act, theTaiwan Travel Actand theTaiwan Assurance Act. The TPA’s aim is to amend the 1979Taiwan Relation Actand is intended to be the most thorough overhaul of US-Taiwan relations. However, this legislation may overturn the current Sino-US diplomatic relation and may lead to a military showdown between Washington and Beijing over the issue of Taiwan. Presumably, the former will also have a massive impact on Cross-Strait relations, potentially leading to direct military conflict between Beijing and Taipei.
The TPA was introduced by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez and Republican Senator Lindsay Graham. Both sponsors are very senior senators, with Sen. Menendez chairing of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and Sen. Graham being a ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. The fact that they are sponsoring this bill means that there is a high degree of bipartisan consensus on the Taiwan issue. Prior to the proposal, the two senators, along with bipartisan lawmakers,visited Taiwanon April 15th. They met with Tawianese President Tsai Ing-wen at the Office of the President.
The bill was initially scheduled for review on August 3rd, 2022, but was postponed due to Senate’s priority to approve Finland’s and Sweden’s accession to NATO. Of course, Pelosi’s visit to Taipei on August 2nd was a further reason to postpone the review. On September 14th, 2022, the U.S. Congress convened, and the Senate scheduled the TPA as the first bill to review which showcased American political and military support for Taiwan as a bipartisan cause.
Menendez published an article,This Is How the US Will Stand With Taiwan, in New York Times on August 3rd. He wrote: “We saw the warning signs for Ukraine in 2014 and failed to take action that might have deterred further Russian aggression. We cannot afford to repeat that mistake with Taiwan.” He then continued “if we do nothing, then we must be comfortable with effectively ceding Taiwan by letting China continue its unabated military, economic and diplomatic bullying campaign.” These two phrases clearly point out the central theme of the TPA that on the issue of Taiwan, the U.S. will not sit by and do nothing.
On January 1st, 1970, the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America formally established diplomatic relations, and at the same time, the Washington announced that it had severed diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, terminated theSino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, and withdrawn U.S. troops from Taiwan. To maintain its unofficial relationship with Taipei, theTaiwan Relations Actwas passed by the House and the Senate on March 28th and 29th, respectively, and signed into law by President Carter on April 10th. At the beginning of theTaiwan Relations Act,it states clearly thatthe purpose of the act is “to help maintain peace, security, stability in Western Pacific and to promote the foreign policy of the United States by authorizing the continuation of commercial, cultural, and other relationsbetween the people of the United Statesandthe people on Taiwan, and for other purposes.” As the legal basis of US-Taiwan unofficial relations, theTaiwan Relations Actis a non-political and non-military law, and it deals only with transactional exchanges between the people of the U.S. and the people of Taiwan.
Seemingly, the TPA now seems to implement political and military parts. According the the act, Washington will “support the security of Taiwan andits right to self-determination, and for other purposes.” Such language has never appeared in any previous U.S. laws or executive orders, from theTaiwan Relations Actto theSix Assurances. According to the U.S. relations with Taiwan Fact Sheet, the U.S. stands neutral on the issue of Taiwan, opposing any unilateral changes to thestatus quofrom either side and does not support Taiwan’s independence. However, “to support Taiwan’s right to self-determination” will change the U.S.’s current neutral position.
The second part of the bill points out and emphasizes the nature of the bill as it emphasizes the “Implementation of An Enhanced Defense Partnership Between the United States and Taiwan.” The word, implementation, shows that the nature of this bill is a compulsive rather than an authorization bill, implying that the law under this part is legally compulsory. As such, the U.S. executive agency has to implement what the TPA decrees. The third section of the bill aims to “Countering People’s Republic of China Aggression and Influence Campaigns.” The fourth section of the bill aims to help Taipei to join international organizations.” The latter sections discusses the US-Taiwan economy, culture, and education.
The title of the first part is “United States Policy Toward Taiwan.” It includes two sections that may cause controversies if it gets passed: Sec. 102. “Treatment of The Government of Taiwan” and Sec. 103. “Taiwan Symbols of Sovereignty.” Sec. 102 is sensitive because it removes restrictions on U.S. and Taiwan officials’ interactions. Under the current unwritten practice, and because the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, U.S. officials are not permitted to interact with Taiwanese officials in official U.S. settings. It’s conventional for officials to meet in plain clothes only in informal settings. This bill is intended to legally break that restriction. Under theTaiwan Relations Act, the U.S. referred to Taipei as the “Taiwan Authority,” while the TPA changed the name to the “Taiwan Government.”
Sec. 103 is a step closer with more details to the extent of Sec. 102 and therefore it will cause more controversies. Sec. 103 covers the code of wearing government uniforms, the exercise of government-sponsored ceremonies (such as National Day of ROC), and the appearance of the “Republic of China” (symbol of sovereignty) on the Department of State website. If this bill passed, the symbols of Taiwan’s sovereignty would not be subject to any U.S. government restrictions when Taiwan officials or diplomats participate in U.S. government-sponsored events. These symbols include the flag of Taiwan and the insignia of its military and government. This means that Taiwan can officially hold raising flag ceremony at Twin Oaks in the U.S. during the national day which the U.S. government usuallypreventsfrom happening. Moreover, Taiwan would be able to display its flag outside of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECCRO) in D.C., thede factoembassy of Taiwan in the U.S. Taiwan’s military personnel would also be permitted to wear military uniform and enter the Pentagon. All of these are not allowed at present.
In addition, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office will be renamed to Taiwan Representative Office and the nomination of the representative of the American Institution in Taiwan (AIT), thede factoAmerican embassy in Taiwan, needs to be confirmed by the Senate. The opening of the Taiwanese Representative Office in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius triggered adiplomatic crisisbetween China and Lithuania. Considering the global influence and position of the U.S., the crisis caused by the renaming of TECRO in D.C. will be far greater than that of Lithuania.
After talking about politics, the TPA will also reform the Washington’s military relationship with Taipei. Sen. Menendez believes that Taiwan is in great danger if the U.S. does not accelerate its military deployment to Taiwan by 2025. His sense of urgency for time has driven him to expedite his review of this bill. As such, the TPA is intended to assist Taiwan to regulate, as well as, monitor Taipei’s military implementation. However, this bill does not change the U.S.strategic ambiguitytowards Taiwan.
In all, the bill indicates the U.S.’s intention to intervene in Taiwan’s military affairs, but hesitates to answer the question of whether the U.S. will send troops to defend Taipei. The military part of the bill is called “Title II: Implementation of an Enhanced Defense Partnership Between The United States and Taiwan.” This part first requires the U.S. to have a forward plan for its military strategy for Taiwan and a strategic assessment of it. This means that the U.S. requires the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department to report to Congress annually. To be able to submit these reports, the Washington needs to send personnel to Taiwan every year to understand the situation. Under theTaiwan Relation Act, arms sales to Taiwan must be limited to a defensive nature. However, “Sec. 201 Amendments to the Taiwan Policy Act” breaks this constraint. It provides for the sale of weapons to Taiwan that help deter the PLA. This is tantamount to unlocking U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as offensive weapons can provide a deterrent effect. “Sec. 2o2 Anticipation Planning and Annual Review” contains forward planning, plus annual assessments of the U.S. defense strategy in Taiwan in the next 10 years. These assessments includes Taiwan’s current service and short-term military strength (including reserves) and U.S. readiness for the cross-strait military conflict; a detailed strategy for Taiwan to resist PLA aggression; an assessment of the cost of U.S. military intervention in the cross-strait military conflict; and the establishment of some short-term indicators of PLA force against Taiwan.
“Sec. 204 Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative” requires Taipei to develop of asymmetric military capabilities. This echoes apointmade by Taiwan’s General Lee Hsi-ming (李喜明), Taiwan’s formal Chief of Staff. The U.S. believes that Taiwan has a limited military budget. PLA’s budget is 17 times of Taiwan’s. Taiwan should invest its limited funds in small military equipment to fight a protracted war. Under Sec. 204 (h), the U.S. aims to provide Taiwan with military financing and appropriations. The financing part is the part that the U.S. is going to designate Taiwan to buy. Taipei has already used up itsspecial defense budgetin the purchase of theF16-V, and the special budget has been budgeted twice. This year’s defense budget plus the special budget is580 billion NTD, and the U.S. still thinks this is not enough.
The U.S. also opposes Taipei’s development of military programs that take a long time to develop, such as submarine ships. The U.S. believes that large military programs are not necessary for Taiwan. Sec. 209 asks the U.S. to prioritize the transfer of surplus weapons to Taiwan due to a fear of Beijing attacking Taiwan in the next five years. In the end, Sec. 213 lists Taiwan as amajor non-NATO ally, of which the U.S. has 19 major non-NATO allies. The advantage of being a major non-NATO ally is that it offer Taipei access to weapons components made by America’s European allies, such as Sweden and Germany. Some European allies are reluctant to provide weapon components to Taiwan because of their diplomatic relationship with Beijing. However, by including Taiwan as a major non-NATO ally, these factors can be significantly reduced.
The TPA offers a remarkable shift in Sino-US relations, in fact, one can argue that this legislation can completely dismantleWashington’s One-China policy. Specially, it is important to assess how China will react to the TPA because of theTaiwan cardthat Washington will have, essentially providing the U.S. with a bargaining chip with Beijing. If Beijing does not react drastically to the passage of this bill, the U.S. will likely be able to further strengthen its relationship with Taiwan in the future as it will ratify a modifiedstatus quo. However, on the other hand, if Beijing reacts too aggressive, it could lead to a cross-strait war.
“U.S. leaders should therefore embrace those parts of Taiwan Policy Act that would help Taiwan economically or militarily… Substantive support of this sort is therefore necessary. And it should be the top priority of the Taiwan Policy Act. After all, embracing symbolism before substance would risk putting the cart before the horse.”","January 11, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/taiwan-policy-act-the-showdown-between-the-us-and-china/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
(Analysis) Discord in the South China Sea: What Place for Diplomacy?,"The South China Sea, at the crossroads of South, Southeast and Northeast Asia, is a maritime area of great competition due to its strategic importance. With the world’s largest ports for containerized trade located around this hub nearly half of the world’s maritime trade passes this region. The maritime space is also endowed with significant fisheries and energy resources, an estimated11 billion barrels of oiland more than5.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas, including10% of the world’s fish catch, are located in these waters.
The strategic nature of this space has made the South China Sea a hot spot for military skirmishes between regional coastal powers. Of the four main archipelagos in the South China Sea, the Paracel and Spratly Islands have received particular attention from the littoral countries because of their wealth in hydrocarbons. The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the People’s Republic of China (China), Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and even the Republic of China (Taiwan) all seek to appropriate a share of the resources inherent in these territories.
Tensions have been growing especially since the 1970s. Taking advantage of the political and civil instability in Vietnam, China’s People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) succeeded inwithdrawing all South Vietnamese naval forcesdeployed on the Paracel Islands in 1974. This critical moment strengthened Chinese ambitions further south, particularly across the 190 to 600 islets and reefs that make up the Spratly Islands. To give weight to its claims, Beijing has embarked on a long-term project to provide the PLAN a modern navy equipped with offensive projection capabilities.
The imperative to make the China a great naval power has truly accelerated over the past decade. As per any modern navy, the PLAN hasacquiredtwentyType 056 Jiangdaoclasscorvettes since 2013. Its mission is toprotectthe exclusive economic zones (EEZ) claimed by the Beijing in the East and South China Seas. In upgrading its forward projection capabilities, the PLAN boasts360 warships, giving it the largest tonnage in the Indo-Pacific and the world.
The comprehensive increase in naval capabilities has enabled the Beijing to make tangible progress in extending its hegemonic control over the South China Sea. Since 2012, the Beijing has intensified the militarization of natural and man-made islands off the Spratly and Paracel Islands, including Scarborough Reef, which has greatly exacerbated incidents at sea, primarily with Vietnam and the Philippines. In April 2012, Chinese vesselsdislodgedFilipino fishermen from the Scarborough Shoal, an area around which they historically fished. In March 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, Chinese coast guard vesselsstruck and sanka Vietnamese fishing boat south of Woody Island. All of these events have prompted increased military engagement by the United States and its Western allies in the area, illustrated by an ever-increasing number of “freedom of navigation operation” (FONOP) along the South China Sea.
While episodes of high tension in the South China Sea are generally the result of Chinese initiatives, Beijing is very selective in targeting its interventions in order to minimize the political impact of its actions on competing coastal countries. In 1988, taking advantage of Vietnam’s regional political isolation, resulting from Hanoi’s alignment with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Chinese navybrutally expelled Vietnamese forcesfrom six of their positions across the Spratly Islands. In 1995, the Beijingsucceededin expanding its positions in the Spratly Islands, this time at the expense of the Filipinos, due to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) not reaching a common position against Chinese regional expansion.
The slightest retaliatory measure against Chinese fishermen by the Indo-Pacific countries automatically triggers the intervention of PLAN’s military forces. For the Chinese political class, the Beijing holdshistorical argumentsover the South China Sea, dating back to the era of the Han Dynasty and the Song Dynasty, during which the imperial courts issued licenses to Chinese fishermen to exploit the area. The PRC also builds its claim publicly usingthe nine-dash line argument— a line encompassing 90% of the three million km of the South China Sea, drawn on Chinese maps during the 1940s.
Economic diplomacy is additionally a vehicle through which Beijing has sought to normalize and advance its geostrategic interests. Its formidable economic opening, initiated under Deng Xiaoping, has enabled the China to become the world’s second largest economy accounting for just over18.8%of international GDP. The Beijing’s economic liberalization during Deng tenure helped renew political relations with neighbouring Southeast Asian countries who yearn for Chinese investment and economic growth. Beijing’s decision not to devalue its national currency,theRenminbi, during the Asian crisis of 1997 was a decisive factor in reshaping relations with non-communist countries. This reaction contrasted particularly with the passive attitude of the United States, by virtue of its neoliberal economic policy. The Chinese authorities notably granted a$1 billion loanto Thailand and soft loans to Myanmar, Indonesia and Laos.
The entry of the China into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 further convinced ASEAN to enhance economic channels with Beijing. The search for regional stability led ASEAN toconcludea Free Trade Agreement with Beijing in 2002 and aStrategic Partnership Agreementin 2004.
Xi Jinping’s accession as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012 has only solidified Beijing’s economic influence across Southeast Asia. During his last two terms, President Xi succeeded in entrenching the Chinese economic power through his flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Billed as a“win-win”initiative, the BRI aims to erode American and Western economic competition through trade expansion, financial integration, the internationalization of the Chinese currency and the strengthening of human relations between recipient countries and China.
Chinese investment projects have been specially active across Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy. In 2021, Chinese investments amounted to$3.2 billionand soared to$3.6 billionbetween January and June 2022.The billions of dollars of liquidity provided by Chinese banks and state-owned enterprises are nonetheless tipping the archipelago towards a significant debt overhang towards Beijing. More than$17 billionof Indonesian debt is owed directly to the Chinese government.
Aware of its economic dependence to Beijing, the Indonesian government has been careful to stay silent about the China’s maritime actions around its exclusive economic zone. This discretion was particularly visible in August 2021 when a Chinese survey ship spentseven weeksmapping the seabed in Indonesia’s EEZ off the Natuna Regency. Beijing’s rising economic influence has also witnessed Jakartavoteagainst a draft UN Human Rights Council resolution on the “Debate on the human rights situation in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China.” Beijing’s established economic power is equally deterring other regional countries from undertaking a Washington-desired containment policy.Cambodia, Thailand and Laosare among the countries in the region that have the most significant economic, political and military cooperation with China.
The recent change of political regime in the Philippines could, however, spark an increase in regional tensions. The conciliatory posture of the previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, toward Beijing has been quickly erased since the presidential victory of Ferdinand Marcos’ son, Bongbong Marcos. On July 12, President Marcos’ Foreign Minister, Enrique Manalo, notablycelebratedthe sixth anniversary of the Hague Tribunal’s ruling on the South China Sea — a verdict that vindicated the Philippines’ claim that Beijing does not have “historic rights” over the bulk of the strategic waters in the South China Sea. In his speech, the ministerdeclared, “We firmly reject any attempt to challenge or even erase it from the laws, from history and from our collective memories,” a clear signal of Manila’s renewed resolve to defend its regional claims.
The current Philippine President has even reportedly urged a renegotiation of loan agreements struck by his predecessor, especially forrailway projects worth $4.90 billion. Since the 2016 Sino-Philippines high-level meeting, in which Xi Jinping promised to unlock$24 billionworth of Chinese projects in the Philippines, only $1 billion worth of Chinese financial investments have materialized.
All these dynamics have given new impetus to political relations between Manila and Washington. President Duterte’s pro-Chinese agenda had considerably plagued relations with the White House. The former Philippine President had even threatened on several occasionsto end the Philippines’ century-old alliance with the United States. The change in political direction championed by the country’s current strongman is manifested by increased high-level meetings with American senior-ranking officials. In August, days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, President Bongbong MarcostoldUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken that he did not believe Nancy Pelosi’s trip had “increased the intensity” of tensions between the U.S. and China. The following month, the Philippine President openly praised American efforts “to maintain peace in [the] region” alongside President Joe Biden. All of these indicators point to a new era of U.S.-Philippine security cooperation in the South China Sea.
Initiated in 2012 under Barack Obama, the U.S. Indo-Pacific pivot aimed to respond to the China’s growing involvement across the vast maritime region, which includes the South China Sea. This rebalancing aims to re-engage traditional U.S. allies — Japan, Australia, South Korea — and forge partnerships with Southeast Asian countries to prevent Beijing from unraveling America’s hub-and-spoke system of alliances and U.S. maritime hegemony.
The arrival of Donald Trump and the Republicans to power in 2017 marked the emergence of incongruities in American strategic policy. From the moment of his inauguration, the new president was set out to deconstruct the legacy of Barack Obama’s foreign policy by pushing ahead a vision that challenged the centrality of the United States in defending its allies and the liberal international order. Donald Trump’swithdrawalfrom the Trans-Pacific Partnership encapsulated his willingness to embrace a form of nationalism and protectionism that neglects American strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. This was, in essence, the cornerstone of his predecessor’s regional trade policy, calibrated to compete against Beijing’s economic reach.
Ever since the end of the Cold War, Southeast Asian countries have come to view U.S. involvement as a source of peace and stability. President Trump’s haphazard approach to foreign policy only undermined and degraded the image and influence of the United States among ASEAN countries. Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsian Loong, in a rare moment of direct criticism of the United States, posed a telling question in reference to the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP —“How can anyone still believe in you?” Unlike his predecessor, who regularly attended high-level ASEAN summits, President Trump’s tenure had been marked by chronic absenteeism from those events. This turned into a diplomatic debacle when Donald Trumpfielded his national security adviser,Robert O’Brien, to represent him at the 35th ASEAN summit in Thailand, prompting regional leaders toboycottthe event.
The arrival of Joe Biden and the Democrats in January 2021 has sought to halt plunging U.S.-Southeast Asian relations. Over the last two years, a series of high-level visits were conducted by Vice PresidentKamala Harris, Secretary of DefenseLloyd Austinand Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenwith their Southeast Asian counterparts. In May 2022, the U.S. Presidentconvened a two-day summit at the White Housewith representatives from Brunei, Indonesia, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, during which Joe Biden pledged$150 millionfor their infrastructure, security and health systems. The former Delaware senator alsoattendedan ASEAN summit in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh days after the U.S. midterm elections, cementing all the interpersonal ties he had forged earlier in the year and upgrading Washington-ASEAN relations to acomprehensive strategic partnership.
But while Joe Biden’s team has focused on correcting the course of Donald Trump’s nationalistic and protectionist policies, Southeast Asian countries still remain deeply concerned about the Democrats’ desire to escalate the regional arms race. In September 2021, some Southeast Asian countries expressed deep concern when Joe Biden unveiled a new strategic alliance with his Australian and British counterparts, “AUKUS,” which is primarily focused on enablingCanberrato acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines with the help of U.S. and British defense contractors. Malaysia and Indonesia have been the most explicit as both nations have long advocatedneutrality and non-interferenceby outside powers in the Indo-Pacific. Political representatives in both countries are primarily concerned that the new agreement will make the South China Sea the site of a future nuclear conflict between Beijing and Washington, especially since the Pentagon is also preparing todeploy up to six B-52 bombersto northern Australia.
The regional security backdrop is likely to be further exacerbated by the prospect of a returning Republican administration in 2024. The landslide victory of rising Florida Governor Ron DeSantis — known for his isolationist views toward U.S. allies and hawkish views on China — combined with the Republican Party’s takeover of the House of Representatives bodes ominously for Democrats for the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Indicative of the turning tide, the New York Post, which previouslyendorsed ex-President Trumpfor re-election, pronounced the Florida governor “DeFUTURE” atop itsfront page. With momentum on the side of the rising GOP governor, Joe Biden will have a hard time fending off a new right-wing populist American presidential hopeful in 2024, an outcome which could see America’s re-engagement of Southeast Asia being revoked after four-short years.
The fear of an arms race and accelerated power competition in the region could ultimately undermine the sustainable economic growth of Southeast Asian powers. It is worth noting that the Asian tiger cub economies: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam were growing at an average of4.7%before the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), their economies are expected to grow by5.3%in 2023, returning to their pre-pandemic economic momentum.
Despite Beijing’s bellicose stance, ASEAN has in the past played a leading role in facilitating the resolution of disputes between the parties involved in the South China Sea. In 2002, itsignedtheDeclaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea(DOC) with China, which has paved the way for a negotiations on a maritime code of conduct. Southeast Asian leaders hoped that this declaration would be the first step in convincing Beijing to turn towards multilateral cooperation.
Given China’s actions in recent years, neither the DOC, nor their negotiations on how to implement it, have done much to ease tensions in the South China Sea. Rather than working together to achieve a diplomatic solution, ASEAN countries have merely developed their own strategies. Vietnam hasstrengthenedits maritime forces and the new Philippine government hasincreasedits military budget by 8 percent for 2023. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia areplaying downtheir differences with Beijing, hoping that quiet diplomacy will persuade China to back down.
There is no prospect of resolving sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea in the short term. Southeast Asian claimant countries lack the hard power capabilities to assert their claims and have not yet demonstrated a willingness to resolve their intra-ASEAN disputes. A common approach to the dispute has often been hampered by Beijing’s ASEAN allies, likeCambodia and Laos, who continually hamper the regional organization’s attempts to form a mutual consensus on the South China Sea. But amidst the increasingly volatile geopolitical backdrop between Beijing and Washington, the two main regional powers, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, should urgently step up their diplomatic dialogue with Beijing and Washington to limit the risk of nuclear war, which would drag the region to ruin.

(Analysis) EU Candidate Status for Ukraine and Moldova: Political Signal or Geostrategic Move?,"Leaders of the EU made a very consequential decision on 23rd Juneto grant Ukraine and Moldova official status of candidate for EU membership. The potential granting of candidate status prompted heated debate in the EU’s political circles. Russian aggression in Georgia and Ukraine demonstrated the failure of EU’s policy regarding its eastern neighborhood. This policy was based on the arrangement of so-called “buffer zones”of friendly states, without hindering Russia’s core interests explicitly. Expansion without enlargementhas shownthat such a strategy can neither satisfy the geopolitical goals of the EU, nor ensure the security of the Union. The bloc cannot rely solely on its soft and transformative power. Therefore, the EU is likely to return to its strongest geopolitical tool – enlargement. Though, before Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the issue of granting candidate status to any country of the Associated Trio (Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) was not being discussed, let alone the prospects of a new wave of EU enlargement.
For quite a long time, Eastern European countries, such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia have been developing their cooperation with the EU in the framework of Eastern Partnership. The EU and these countries managedto sign Association Agreements and established the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas.These efforts are aimed at internal transformations of EU neighbors that will allow them to fulfill criteria for potential membership in the Union. Nevertheless, there was relatively limited engagement between the EU and these countries, owing partly to Russia’s claim to“privileged spheres of interest”in the post-Soviet space and also to the lack of the EU’s strategic vision. Consequently, the EU’s goals in this region are unclear as there are no consistent policy in this respect, and one could hardly predict what the EU was intending to do. This begs the question of whether the EU is planning to challenge Russia directly to retake the initiative in this region by acceleration of the integration of Ukraine and Moldova into the bloc or will Brussels keep maintaining the status quo and sticking to the “buffer zone” approach? Anyway, the Post-Soviet space will remain an area of geopolitical contestation between the European Union and Russia.
Russia’s military involvement in Georgia in 2008 and invasion of Ukraine in 2014 have further raised questions about whether the EU is ready to respond firmly in order to strengthen its own influence in these countries. It turned out that in 2014 Russia was ready to use force in order to preserve control over its sphere of “vital interests” while the EU was, to a large extent, divided in its response to Russia. A new critical challenge that the EU faces is Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which requires the unified position of all member states.Ukraineapplied for EU membershipduring the first days of Russia’s large-scale invasion and other countries of the Associated Trio, Georgia and Moldova,did the same.
The context of the Russo-Ukrainian War revitalized the EU’s enlargement agenda. However, before the EU Commission issued its recommendation to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, certain member states were pushing for the establishment of a framework that would include EU neighbors. For instance, Emmanuel Macron suggested to create a“European Political Community,”which would be a club of the EU member states, its neighbors and non-EU members. The neighbors of the EU opposed this initiative because they thought it would serve as a substitute for candidate status and EU membership. EU leaders responded to the pressure by reassuring that the platform was not intended to serve as an alternative to EU membership. The goal is to strengthen political dialogue and cooperation, particularly in the area of international security. The EU has decided to act after almost a decade of ambiguous policies towards Eastern European countries.
Earlier, the EU stuck to the so-called “Open Doors Policy” and avoided any concrete statements on potential membership of these countries. Without exaggeration, the EU has taken a serious decision to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. It also promised the same status for Georgia when it fulfills all the necessary preconditions. One of them is strengthening Georgia’s political institutions, which seem fairly fragile. There are also accusations of fraud, intimidation, vote-buying, cronyism and police harassment in Georgia. Also, the EU is concerned about civil liberties, the influence of oligarchs on politics and the freedom of the media. It is therefore necessary to understand why this decision was made and what the consequences are for both the EU and these countries.
First of all, this decision was made in order to send a signal to Russia, as it means that theEU recognizes Ukraine and Moldova to be a part of the European family, not a distant relative as Moscow would want. Practically, the EU is shifting from its inconsistent stance on the integration of the Associated Trio countries and conveying a clear message that they will never be part of Russia. By sending this signal, the EU is stating that it is ready to support Ukraine in its efforts to counter Russian aggression and to protect the core values of a rules-based international order. By sending this signal, the EU is stating that it is ready to support Ukraine in its efforts to counter Russian aggression and to protect the core values of a rules-based international order. By granting candidate status to Moldova, the EU reaffirmed its commitment to support Chisinau considering the background of Russia’s actions in Ukraine. This is especially relevant because of the occupied territory of Transnistria, where according to various sources some 2000 military personnel of the Russian Federation are present. Concerns over Transnistria were also expressed in theMEPs statements, where they stressed the serious provocations and security incidents in Moldova. As a result, the EU pledged to support these countries as much as needed, making this the strongest response to Russian actions since 2008. As a result, the EU pledged to support these countries as much as needed, making this the strongest response to Russian actions since 2008 by imposing unprecedented sanctions and pressure on Putin, freezing Russian assets and providing military assistance to Ukraine. As the Ukrainian people demonstrated their willingness to fight for the free and democratic future of their state, the EU cannot remain silent.
The role of the core values the EU is pursuing and their impact on decision-making cannot be overestimated in its relations with any country, considering the EU’s strong profile in democracy promotion, protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this context, it is worth mentioningthe visit of Olaf Scholz, Emmanuel Macron, Mario Draghi and Klaus Iohannis to Ukraine on 16th of June.They were able to see with their own eyes the consequences of Russia’s invasion on the liberated areas of the Kyiv region. It is likely that the EU leaders in Irpin, Ukraine felt the atrocities and human rights violations committed by Russia, which could have influenced their positions in favor of granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova.
Along with the need to send a signal to Russia, the EU’s commitment to democracy and preserving human rights, there is another critical aspect that could shape the EU’s decision – public opinion within the Union. It was not just the EU leaders who saw the evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine. The public support increased after the EU leaders visited liberated Irpin in the Kyiv region. Even before the trip of the European politicians to Kyiv, the whole world, and the citizens of the EU, were shocked by the photos shared on the Internet that showed hundreds of innocent civilians that were tortured and killed. In this respect, it is noteworthy to mentionthe survey conducted among EU citizens by Eurobarometer in April 2022. As a whole, Europeans are of the opinion that the EU has been strong (79%) and united (63%) as well as quick (58%) in responding to the war. Most respondents embrace unwavering support for Ukraine as 80% approve the financial support provided to Ukraine and 66% agree that “Ukraine should join the EU when it is ready.” In addition, 71% believe that Ukraine is part of the European family and 89% feel sympathy towards Ukrainians. In April the level of public support for Ukraine’s integration into the EU was probably at its highest. Such strong support could be a result of popular outcry regarding Russia’s actions and a widespread sympathy towards Ukrainians. The EU’s decision of granting candidate status could also be driven by the significant pressure of public opinion. The creative strategy of Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also be mentioned as his approach has thus far been on delivering online speeches to the parliaments of various countries, including those of EU member states. In his appeals, he emphasized the need for Ukraine’s fast-track membership in the EU and the granting of candidate status as a first step towards it.
It is pertinent to note the commitment of top EU politicians to this decision as they are the ones who were most active in pushing the agenda and course of action that was being taken by the EU. First of all, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, played a major role.
Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective. We want them to live with us the European dream
The European Commission has always been a key institution of the EU that drives major changes and policies of the Union. Von der Leyen’s ambitions to increase the EU’s role on the international stage can also be explained by her strong position with regard to granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. Furthermore, it is also consistent with the remarks she made after being appointed European Commission President that instead of a “political Commission” as Junker had, von der Leyen will lead a“geopolitical Commission.”Such a take on the EU’s global role has a direct influence on the EU’s Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as well as the EU’s Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement. Von der Leyen’s desire to strengthen the EU’s geopolitical standing clash with Russia’s claims over countries that Moscow believes to be its “near abroad.” And it was not only von der Leyen who supported the EU’s decision. President of the European Council, Charles Michel, was also supportive in his speeches regarding granting candidate status. For instance, he mentioned that this is going to bean unprecedented eventin European history with the EU making such a strong geopolitical move in order to strengthen security and stability across the continent. In addition, Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, urged the EU to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldovain response to the autocratic threat. This shows that the EU’s main institutions, the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, have backed this critical step.
As opposed to 2014, the EU is now willing to demonstrate its ability to carry out proactive policy towards its eastern neighborhood. A key question is whether the EU will be unified enough and able to find the “power” it needs to project its influence on Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Specifically, it raises doubts considering the internal crises that the EU faces right now with regard toenergy crisis,Brexit outcomes, anddemocracy backsliding in certain member states. Furthermore, the decision to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova was made againstthe backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and China. Candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova can be regarded as the EU’s attempt of achieving strategic autonomy in the context of a fragmented international order and geopolitical contest between major powers, by strengthening its eastern flank. Such move can be regarded as a geopolitical maneuver that would help the EU to expand its influence and enhance its position in the international system.
Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia could have a major impact on the EU decision as the countries are often referred to as the “New Europe” which tend to position themselves as supporters of European integration. Their position can be explained by the rooted perceptions of Russian menace that these countries are facing because of theclose geographical proximityof Russia’s borders. Moreover, besides the constant threats coming from Russia, these states are also exposed to the harmful actions of Belarus and its autocratic regime. A case in point is the recent artificial border crisis, which might be viewed as a hybrid tool used to threaten Poland, the Baltic states, and the EU in general. Overall, EU enlargement has been a key topic on the agenda of these countries in order to boost stability and security on their borders. Not to mention Poland’s role in creating the Eastern Partnership to bring eastern neighbors closer to the EU.
In a practical sense, before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine started,Polish President Andrzej Duda and President of Lithuania Gitanas Nauseda visited Kyivto deliver the message that their countries will do everything in their power to ensure that Ukraine receives candidate status. In addition,the Polish president paid a few visits to some European capitalsin order to persuade member states that were hesitant about granting candidate status.
Another significant factor that impacted the EU’s decision was the necessity to provide increased economic support and investments for Ukraine and Moldova. Providing additional funding to Ukraine and Moldova not onlyfacilitatesreforms but is also considered essential to minimizing the negative impact of the Russian invasion. A candidate state of the EU is entitled to additional financial and institutional assistance through theInstrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). A basic purpose of the IPA is to speed up the transfers of EU funds, which in turns ensures reform stability. Moreover, considering the fact that Ukraine’s economy and infrastructure are severely damaged as a result of ongoing aggression, candidate status was thought to be an effective step to support Ukraine’s economic and financial sectors, as well as to help rebuild the country after the war is over. Candidate status, in turn, is seen as helpful inattracting more investments, which the country urgently needs now. For Moldova, the aftershocks of the war also caused immense damage to various sectors of its economy. Candidacy, therefore, could be viewed as a vital step in supporting the fragile economy of Moldova by utilizing the IPA and unblocking additional sources of financial assistance to Chisnau.
There is not a single social or economic area that would not be affected by the war. Rising prices for oil products and natural gas, difficulties with the export of agricultural products, the closure of trade routes are the consequences of the war.
Upon the EU’s decision to grant candidate status, the speed of the integration process will depend on how successfully Ukraine and Moldova implement necessary reforms and carry out internal transformations in order to move to the next stage – opening of the accession talks. Nevertheless, the ball is not only in Ukraine’s or Moldova’s court, as much will also depend on the consensus and readiness of the EU to go further. In a nutshell, the political will of the EU member states is going to be a decisive factor for the possibility of fast-tracking membership to Ukraine and Moldova. Indeed, these factors raise the question of whether the EU will be able to absorb new members in the near future. That is why many Ukrainian and Moldovan experts are afraid of falling into the so-called“Balkan trap.”
Before giving candidate status, international experts, politicians, and diplomats were worried about the differentiation of the enlargement process. This is in light of the fact that Western Balkan countries have not yet achieved success in their integration into the EU despite receiving the same status. The fact that any country canveto the EU decision to open accession talks makes the process time consuming, as it was in the case ofBulgaria’s veto regarding North Macedonia.
The experiences of North Macedonia and other states indicate that the issue of the EU’s readiness to accept new members is truly critical. In the short-term, candidate status is not a panacea, because accession talks can begin in 10 years or so. One needs to remember that candidate status does not guarantee accession. To a large extent, the European integration of Ukraine and Moldova will depend on the success of the Western Balkans as these two processes seem to be intertwined. For instance, Olaf Scholz was talking about the possibility of the accession of the Western Balkans and other candidates, including Ukraine and Moldova. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was skeptical even about candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova.
Furthermore, Rutte was saying that granting this status would be“unfair” with regard to Balkan stateswho have been waiting for such a status much longer. Another key factor that might be a problem when taking into account the experience of the Western Balkans is the size of territory.As far as the EU is not ready to integrate small countries such as Montenegro, Albania and Northern Macedonia, integration of bigger states seems to be complicated indeed.When it comes to Ukraine, for example, the process can be difficult indeed as it will requireadditional reforms within the EUthat can take time. Hence, fast-track membership for Ukraine and Moldova is difficult to imagine in the short term. In the end, it is the progress in reforms by Kyiv and Chisnau and the political will of member states that are going to be decisive factors for the future enlargement. Despite this, the EU’s decision seems to be more than just a political gesture.","November 29, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/candidate-status-for-ukraine-and-moldova-the-eus-political-signal-or-geostrategic-move/,Vitalii Rishko,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
(Analysis) Iraqi Kurdistan: the EU’s Next Major Energy Supplier?,"REPowerEU, the European Union’s bold new energy action plan, was unveiled in May of this year with two main goals, end the EU’s dependence on Russian oil imports and tackle climate change. Regarding the first goal, given theKremlin’s willingness to weaponize the EU’s high level of energy dependency on Russia, it is imperative for the EU to decouple from Russia’s energy industry in the long term and ensure Europe’s resilience to future energy supply shocks. One of REPowerEU’s proposed solutions is the diversification of the EU’s energy suppliers. Anticipating such a step, the European Commission has developed mechanisms to improve the collective bargaining power of member states in purchasing energy. However, the question remains, who can act as a new reliable energy supplier to the EU?
During the 2022 Global Energy Forum held in Dubai, Prime Minister Masrour Barzani of the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) took the stand to highlight the meteoric rise of his region’s energy industry,confidently assuringthat “Kurdistan will soon become an important source of energy for the world’s growing demand.” He went on to make thebold claimthat “We (the KRI) will become a net exporter of gas to the rest of Iraq, Turkey, and Europe in the near future, and help meet their energy security needs…the potential to meet the local needs including other parts of Iraq but also export to Turkey and onto Europe is there.”
With one of the last great oil and gas frontiers, the KRI is estimated to hold a whopping45 billion barrels of oil reservesand5.67 trillion cubic meters of natural gas reserves(3% of global reserves). Fossil fuel exploration in the region dates back to 2005 when Iraq adopted its first democratic constitution. The KRI was recognized as a federal entity endowed with the right to exploit its own natural resources. In vertu of this constitutional right, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) promulgated the Kurdistan Oil and Gas Law. This established a Ministry of Natural Resources and endowed it with the power to contract international oil companies (IOC). Thanks to theinvolvement of IOCsandthe U.S. government, energy production in the region has been significantly scaled up, making the KRI a major energy supplier.
This fact is not overlooked by Turkey, the main benefactor of the KRI’s fossil fuel industry. Both oil and gas exports from the KRG travel throughpipelinesto Turkey where they are sold and shipped overseas. Since 2013, Ankara and Erbil have constructed a network of pipelines delivering over600,000 barrels of oilper day and10 billion cubic metersof gas per year, with futureexpansions in progress.
Besides collecting a substantial transit fee from the Kurd’s use of its pipelines, developing the KRI’s gas and oil production plays into Ankara’s domestic and regional interests. Domestically, the growing demand for energy coupled with a lack of its own resources pushes Ankara to cultivate new sources to fuel its economic growth. The ruling AKP party’s courting of its own Kurdish population to curry its electoral favor also serves as a motivation for better ties with the KRI.  Regionally, Ankara aims to act as an energy bridge between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe which gives it a point of leverage in negotiations with the EU. Turkey also needs the KRI as a bulwark against an increasingly hostile central government in Baghdad that isfalling under the influence of Iran, Turkey’s regional competitor.
These developments have attracted the ire of the Iraqi Federal Government (IFG), whichconsiders the contracts with Turkey illegal. The IFG has long-standing disputes with the KRG over the management of its energy resources as it regards deals made to export Kurdish energy without its consent as unlawful. Baghdad has adopted various pressure tactics in the past to halt Kurdish exports, such asdenying the KRI its share of the national budget,suing the KRIin internal and international courts,lodging complaints against Turkey, andtemporary blockadesof Kurdish oil fields. These efforts have only pushed Erbil to seek economic independence by rapidly scaling up its pipeline infrastructure.
This status quo came to a brutal halt in February when the Iraqi Supreme Courtruledthe Kurdish Oil and Gas Law of 2007 to be unconstitutional. The ruling obliges the KRG to cede all oil and gas produced in the KRI to the IFG while empowering Baghdad to annul contracts between Erbil and IOCs. The decision came just a few days after a meeting between Prime Minister Barzani and Turkish President Erdogan where they discussed opportunities for exporting Kurdish natural gas exports to Europe. Following this decision, Baghdad haslaunched legal actionsagainst IOCs operating in the KRI, as well asannullingfour contracts between the KRG and IOCs. Facing the threat of litigation and being banned from access to the more lucrative oil sector of southern Iraq, several western IOCs havescaled back their activitiesin the KRI.
While Baghdad establishes legal chokeholds on the KRI’s energy industry, Tehran has exerted more stringent policies of hard power. On March 13th,12 missiles rained downon the villa of Baz Karim Baranzji, a Kurdish oil mogul and owner of the KRI’s biggest energy company, KAR Group. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)took responsibilityfor the attack claiming that Baranzji’s residence was a “Zionist strategic center of plotting evil.” Iraqi and Turkish officialsbelievethat the strikes were in response to Israel’s involvement in a plan to deliver Kurdish gas to Turkey and beyond. The villa wasthe site of meetingsbetween Israeli and US energy officials and specialists who spoke of a new pipeline that would pump Kurdish gas to Turkey.More strikeswere followed by Iranian-backed militias on the KRI’s largest oil refinery at Kawergosk andon Khor Mor, the KRI’s largest gas field.
It would appear that the main objective of Iran’s missile diplomacy is the discontinuation of Kurdish gas exports as its expansion threatens Tehran’s own position as a gas exporter to Turkey and Iraq. Exports to Iraq and Turkeymade up 64% and 33%,of Iran’s total gas exports in 2020. This means virtually all Iranian gas goes to these two countries. At a time when the Iranian economy suffers from crippling Western sanctions and the possibility of them getting lifted in negotiations for the revival of the nuclear deal between Iran and the West, energy exports to Baghdad and Ankara constitute a vital economic lifeline for Tehran.
Baghdad is also heavily reliant on Tehran for gas as itflaresthe majority of its “wet” natural gas (by-products of oil extraction) and exploits little of its “dry” gas fields. The Iraqi Kurds are the polar opposite as they have made excellent use of their natural gas. Erbil has achieved energy independence and currently provides Baghdad with a stable and cheaper alternative to Tehran, which hascut gas flowsto Iraq several times due to production issues. In light of this opportunity, it is all the more confounding why gas-starved Baghdad decided to penalize the KRG for developing its fossil fuel industry. A likely explanation, given the huge amount ofinfluence Tehran wieldson Iraq’s political scene, is that pressure from Iran contributed to the decision to strike down the KRG’s Oil and Gas Law.
However, the biggest obstacle preventing Prime Minister Barzani from realizing his dream of the KRI becoming a major energy supplier to Europe is the fractures within his own government. Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Bafel Talabani’s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) jointly govern the KRI as a confederacy.A crisishas gripped this uneasy coalition as disputes over the Kurdish candidacy for the Iraqi presidency and management of gas exploitation pushed both parties onto the verge of abolishing the KRG and establishing separate administrations. Complicating the situation further is that KRI’s two biggest gas fields, Khor Mor and Chemchemal, lie in PUK-controlled regions, essential regions needed for KDP gas to reach Turkish and European markets.
Considering the significant reserves in the PUK’s gas fields (15 trillion cubic feet) production can be increased to cover domestic needs while leaving a surplus for exports. Yet disagreements between the two parties have already hindered development. The PUK blocked the implementation of a December 2021 agreement between the KDP-led Kurdish government and the KAR group to upgrade and extend gas pipelines to the city of Dohuk, refusing technicians entry to its fields.
Assaulted on different fronts by both lawsuits and explosive projectiles, Erbil remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining and developing its energy autonomy. Yet the vast potential of its energy reserves will remain unrealized as long as the political deadlock between the KDP and PUK persists. The stalemate over the candidacy for the Iraqi presidency, constitutionally reserved for a Kurd, finally ended on October 13th when the Iraqi parliament elected KDP-backed politician Abdul Latif Rashid. The fierce contest between the two parties led relations to deteriorate to their lowest point since the civil war between the two factions in the 1990s.
Considering all the factors of instability plaguing the KRI, PM Barzani’s vision to pump gas to Europe will remain a pipe dream for now. When it comes to the EU’s own ambition to decouple from Russia diversifying energy suppliers remains an important facet of strengthening the Europe’s energy security. However, it should not take precedence over the plan’s other measure – themassive scale-up of renewablesin power generation. For the EU to achieve true energy autonomy, as well as radically decrease its carbon footprint to combat climate change, investment in renewables is essential for producing cheap and clean energy within the bloc. Brussels would be wiser to concentrate on measures such as theEU Solar Energy Strategythan invest in pipelines that may never become operational due to civil strife or geopolitical competition. The future of Europe’s energy security lies notbeyond its borders, but within it.
Iran hasintensifiedits strikesagainst the KRI. The regimeclaimsthat secessionist Iranian-Kurdish militants based in the region are responsible for themassive proteststhat have gripped the Islamic Republic in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. In an attempt to divert public attention away from the excesses of the regime, Tehran is promoting a secessionist narrative that blames the civil unrest on Iranian and Iraqi Kurds. The most recent attack consisted of ballistic missile and drone strikes that killed 26 Kurdish militants. Tensions are higher than ever with the Kurdish militantsrefuseTehran’s calls to disarm and Tehranbuilds up its forcesand threatens cross-border operationsto clear out the militants.","December 19, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-eu-energy-diversification-a-time-for-new-partnerships-the-case-of-the-kurdish-region-of-iraq/,Alain Tao,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
(Analysis) Assessing the Added Value of European Engagement with Southeast Asia,"Southeast Asia is located at the core of the wider Indo-Pacific region and embraces one of the globe’s most crucial bodies of water for maritime trade, the South China Sea. Being also home to vibrantly growing economies, the region holds great strategic importance for most global players. This includes the European Union (EU), who have vital interests and economic relationships and security agreements.
Since the publication of its so-calledIndo-Pacific Strategyin 2021, the EU has been debating whether it can have a greater role as an external power in Southeast Asia. Here, one of the most relevant regional actors, andstrategic partnersof the EU, is the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), comprised by Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
As outlined by itsfounding declaration, ASEAN aims at promoting regional economic growth, peace and stability as well as cooperation in multiple fields through the creation of an association for regional cooperation involving 10 sovereign member countries. The outlook and aims of the organization closely resemble those of the EU which arguably was amodel throughout ASEAN’s whole integration experienceor, at least,when the relevance of the organization was put into question.
Therefore, in light of thismentor-mentee relationshipexisting between the two organizations, the EU has always been well-positioned to provide guidance to ASEAN’s institutional development and steer the regionalization process in Southeast Asia, in turn, establishing a more solid European presence in the region.
In this regard, the approach of the EU could be interpreted as nurturing this special relationship with ASEAN to extend the European clout in the region. As further explained below, the bloc holds a vital interest in securing economic activities as well as expanding its economic ties with fast-growing economies in the region and abroad. Furthermore, the EU is willing to play an active role in strengthening regional stability and security, not only to avoid a possible undermining of its economic interests but also to prevent the local proliferation of security phenomena that might have implications for European security. From a geopolitical perspective, since the region is expected to be the privileged arena of great power competition between the US and China, Europeans also feel the need to play a more meaningful role to retain global geopolitical relevance.
Leveraging its status and expertise as the globe’s most advanced regional organization, the core of the EU policy in the region has been to strengthen ties with ASEAN while improving the organization’s centrality in regional affairs and promoting its development according to the European model of regionalization. These objectives translated intopolitical and functional supportfor further attempts of Southeast Asia to progress on the path of regionalization as well asactive participationin wider, and ASEAN-centred, regional organizations, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
The inherent character of ASEAN — exemplified by the concept of theASEAN Wayand its emphasis on consensus and non-interference in domestic affairs — prevented any substantial leaps towards deeper regionalization. Moreover, due to thelack of interestsfrom other regional stakeholders, like China, in multilateral diplomacy and rules-based solutions to regional disputes, ASEAN has been limited in how it can regionalize institutional solutions to specific geopolitical issues. Within this void, the EU can offer unique supranational assets that are both very appealing and, in most cases, asymmetric to what the U.S. and China offer. There is room for the EU to also fit in the region as a “third-power” that can mitigate increasing pressures from the bipolarity of Sino-US competition.
Regardless of the geographic distance, Southeast Asia is one of the main regions of transit and destination for EU trade. With a total trade of more than€215 billionin goods (2021) and more than €82 billion in services (2020), the EU is ASEAN’s third largest economic partner after China and the U.S. Similarly, ASEAN represents the EU’s third-largest trading partner outside of Europe.
Since 2011, overall trade with ASEAN has almost doubled in size, and, looking further into the future, the potential for economic cooperation is even greater. In this regard, ASEAN as a single economic bloc isforecastedto take the spot of the world’s fourth-largest economy by 2030. Indonesia alone is expected to rise to this position by2050(in purchasing power parity terms), with the region hosting other varying dynamic economies. Some examples include Vietnam and the Philippines, which are likely to experience some of the sharpest rises in the rankings and enter the realm of the 20th largest economies globally.
Shifting the focus to wider regional dynamics, the South China Sea, which is located at the core of Southeast Asia, represents a vital place of transit for EU trade reaching both Southeast and East Asia.According to the European External Action Service(EEAS), approximately 40% of EU external trade goes through the region each year. Considering that the EU’s exports of goods in 2021 amounted to approximately€2 trillion, it would mean that approximately €800 billion of EU traded goods transited the South China Sea that year. Therefore, the EU has enormous direct economic stakes in the region and as an area of maritime transit for its trade with East Asia.
On the offer side, the EU manages to be a rather attractive and competitive economic partner for the region. Two features of the EU help define its strong appeal; the provision of financial resources in the form of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Official Development Assistance (ODA); and the opportunity to access the European market — which is the globe’s largest trading bloc.
In 2021, the bloc was the second largest provider of FDI after the U.S., with a total of more than$26 billion. This is approximately double the amount of FDI provided by China — with the exclusion of Hong Kong — or Japan in the same year. In certain years, the EU has been by far the largest source of FDI, whereas, in some ASEAN countries, like the Philippines, the total FDI stocks attributable to the EU made it thelargest foreign investor.
The ODA is another significant source of funding for Southeast Asian countries. The EU bloc has delivered more than€28 billionin gross development assistance to ASEAN from the period of 2007-2022. Although this figure remains low compared to other regional recipients of European ODA, the EU represents a consistent development partner for ASEAN countries, with an average provision of approximately €1.75 billion each year since 2007.
The second, and arguably most significant feature of the EU’s economic appeal, is its market. Having access to the European market means being able to export and invest in all 27 Member States. These account for a collective GDP of approximately €14 trillion and a share of14% of global trade in goods. Unlike China, the EU market enjoyscompetitive standardsin terms of the certainty of the legal framework and the transparency of its rules, making the choice to export there a safe bet. Furthermore, the EU is famous for being a rather open economic bloc that is willing to finalize substantial trade agreements in the region. This is a feature that distinguishes Europeans from Americans, the latter being less willing to provide market access as recently demonstrated by the limited scope of theIndo-Pacific Economic Framework(IPEF).
In contrast, the EUconcluded negotiationsfor free trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Negotiations are ongoing with Indonesia, whereas the process involving Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines is currently on hold. Delays notwithstanding, the EU has expressed the aspiration to resume thesenegotiationswith the right conditions and has always been rather outspoken about its ambition to ultimately achieve a region-to-region agreement on free trade with ASEAN.
Therefore, the characteristics of the EU as an economic actor, together with the importance of trade for ASEAN’s economic growth, make the EU a reliable long-term economic partner for Southeast Asia. Considering the broader geopolitical scenario, ASEAN also needs to reduce its economic dependency on China, its main trade partner since 2009, with whom ASEANperformed 18%of its trade in 2019. In the context of political tensions and potential military flash points throughout the South China Sea, and considering the precedents of Chinaweaponizing its trademight against other countries, increasing ASEAN’s trade flows with the EU would represent an opportunity to reduce the bloc’s economic vulnerabilities.
Peace and security in the region are issues of primary concern for the EU. This is not only due to the EU’s economic interests, given the need to preserve safe lines of maritime transport for approximately 40% of its external trade, but also to a direct interest in regional securityper-se. In a globalized world, allowing the proliferation of a situation of insecurity in one region is likely to have external implications or spill over to others. This is particularly true fornon-traditional security threatssuch as international terrorism, transnational organized crime, or mass migration, which are issues that go beyond the dimension of conventional conflicts and are transnational by definition.
Along these lines,the 2021 EUIndo-Pacific Strategyemphasized the need to intensify cooperation with ASEAN on transnational security issues such as counter-terrorism (CT), cybersecurity, non-proliferation, or maritime security. Although this strategy was developed before the war in Ukraine, it remains a relevant compass to direct the EU’s engagement with the region. In these circumstances, the EU will likely need to downsize its initial commitment to project military power in the Indo-Pacific, a rather problematic policy from the beginning. On the positive side, the bloc now has the opportunity to rethink its security approach, prioritizing non-traditional security capabilities over military deployments. This would also rely on the true strengths of Europeans that, since the end of the Cold War, had to deal with a range ofnon-traditional security threatsand developed their capabilities accordingly. Among these threats, international terrorism represents an appropriate case study for the analysis of the EU’s unique and asymmetric non-traditional security offer to Southeast Asia. Furthermore, terrorism is an even more current concern in Southeast Asia,where episodes of this kind peaked in 2019.
In the field of CT, the EU is a valuable repository of best practices and expertise on how to tackle the phenomenon on a transnational level. Over time, it has built supranational tools and procedures to support a collective effort to fight terrorism. Given the similarities in the outlook of the two organizations, this portfolio represents a tailor-made offer hardly obtainable for ASEAN elsewhere.
In terms of actors, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) and the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) are the two most relevant CT players at the European level. Eurojust is tasked with assisting EU member states with joint investigations, prosecutions, and broader judicial cooperation. Therefore, it facilitates the prosecution of terrorism cases throughout multiple and diverse national jurisdictions. The agency also handles aEuropean Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register, which collects data about proceedings at the member state level and helps to create connections among judicial cases throughout Europe. On the other hand, Europol functions more at the operational level and hosts a unit dedicated to CT, theEuropean Counter Terrorism Centre. The agency acts as a platform for exchanging information and cooperating on cross-border operations as well as a support role by providing CT expertise, crisis response support, operational deployments, and analytical support.
The EU has also developed large-scale systems and procedures to bring together IT instruments, member states, and CT supranational players. TheSchengen Information System II (SIS II)is one example. This database allows national law enforcement authorities to swiftly access and exchange a variety of CT-related information concerning people, ranging from identity misuse, people involved in serious crimes to people banned from the Schengen area, and objects like stolen vehicles or firearms. Furthermore,the EU Commissionemphasized how these elements are now part of a cohesive procedure since member states “are obliged to create a SIS alert for all cases related to terrorist offenses… Member States will also have to inform Europol of hits alerts linked to terrorism, which will help to connect the dots at the European level.”
Given the asymmetry of its assets compared to security offers in the region, the EU has the potential to play a key role with a strong focus on non-traditional security, an area that has been largely disregarded by other foreign security providers. Additionally, it can count on itsmentor-mentee relationshipwith ASEAN for which the EU is a natural repository of expertise about regionalization and joint action in the field of economics and security. Its perception as a neutral power in purely military terms is another significant asset that facilitates the involvement of the EU in regional affairs.
Therefore, the EU’s active engagement with Southeast Asia should be very welcomed by regional countries as it provides the region and its countries with the capacity to address gaps in regional security and economics. More importantly, a committedEuropean presenceshould be perceived by ASEAN countries as an opportunity to better position themselves within the growingSino-US rivalryfor regional hegemony as well as a balancing factor to renew the stability in the region.","January 17, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/assessing-the-added-value-of-the-european-engagement-with-southeast-asia/,Andrea Laroni,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
SOTEU 2022: Expectations on the Roadmap to 2023,"On the 14th of September, President Ursula Von der Leyen spoke in front of the European Parliament to deliver the 2022 State of the Union speech. The President of the Commission was accompanied by the guest of honour for the evening, Mrs. Olona Zelenska. Thespeechwas marked by the serious challenges that loom over Europe for the coming winter – the Ukrainian war, which has prompted an energy crisis, stark inflation and interruptions in supply-chains across Europe as a spillover effect, among other consequences.
TheState of the Unionspeech serves as a roadmap that outlines medium and long-term priorities for the European Commission. Along with a general overview of the upcoming political and socioeconomic decisions, this momentum is also used to announce high-profile decisions or initiatives. The discourse is usually delivered in September by the President of the Commission and marks the beginning of the political year. This address happens in front of the European Parliament followed by a discussion by Members of the European Parliament (MEP), representing the views of the different parliamentary groups about the issues addressed.
Over the years, the delivery of the State of the Union is welcomed and expected as a transparency and accountability exercise since it holds the European institutions accountable about what has, and has not, been executed. It allows voters, policymakers, political parties and experts to draw their own balance regarding the political year.
The situation leading to the 2021 and 2022 SOTEU could not be more different. By September 2021, the European Union was focused on the development and distribution of vaccines on a massive roll-out strategy that would prevent a rise in cases for the autumn-winter. As of 2022, President Von der Leyen could not prevent addressing the situation in Ukraine, especially considering that the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, was present in the chamber.
In order to underscore the importance of the speech this year, the SOTEU was one of the first public appearances of President Von der Leyen after thereportpublished by the Court of Auditors regarding the vaccines’ contract with Pfizer on the 12th of September. The Court argued a lack of transparency regarding the conclusion of the EU’s biggest vaccine contract. Allegedly, it issuggestedthat the EU rulebook for negotiations with third parties was overlooked for the occasion and that the President of the Commission used informal connections and means of communication to agree on a preliminary contract. Back in 2019, a committee of the German Parliamentraisedsimilar suspicions on President Von der Leyen about her management of the Defence Ministry and the attainment of important contracts with external advisors.
While it would have been easier to organize the speech around general topics like energy or the economy, their complex interconnection with the Ukrainian conflict made the war the guiding thread throughout the speech. During the first moments of her speech, President Von der Leyen announced a future project for rebuilding Ukrainian schools that will support the gradual integration of the Ukrainian market into the European one by removing import duties and roaming charges. Despite the fact that the war is far from over, Brussels is already focusing on a prospective reconstruction.
On the energy topic, the President of the Commission celebrated a decrease in imported Russian gas. By this time last year, there was a40% of imported gas, which has been reduced to a 4%. Thanks to theGas Storage Regulation, storage capacities are at least at their 90%. It doesn’t stop there. In the coming months, we can expect a cap on extra-benefits of energy companies, which is under negotiation as we speak. On a long-term basis, the European Union announced a “a deep and comprehensive reform” of the electricity market that should. This will, most likely, follow a similar system as the one implemented by Spain and Portugal, known as the “Iberian Exception” which allowed them to enjoy lower electricity fares. On top of that, the EU will work on creating anEU Hydrogen Bankto push for renewable energies.
Moving forward, the President of the Commission spoke on industry. She highlighted the importance of “investing in sustainability and to invest sustainable”, thus reinforcing the idea that initiatives in industry, economy and climate can no longer be isolated from one another. Brussels intends to push a holistic approach on the European Green Deal, addressing the three issues simultaneously.
Given the current circumstances, it comes as no surprise that agriculture and migration weren’t even mentioned. Even though the former could be fit into economic and environmental debates, the reality is that the Common Agricultural Policy received no attention during the speech. Despite that,new legislationon the matter is expected to begin in 2023. As for migration, it hasn’t found its way into the political agenda lately. However, it is a topic that should be followed closely, given the new elected governments around the European Union. Areportpublished in the beginning of October showcases recent developments on migration and asylum, but the truth is the momentum of the New Pact on Asylum and Migration faded with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As an unexpected closing remark, Ursula Von der Leyen announced that the moment of reviewing theTreaty on the Functioning of the European Unionhas arrived. She is expected to call on the European Convention in order to discuss a reform on the Treaties. This debate was alreadyongoingin the European Parliament in June 2022.
The circumstances that led to the State of the European Union Speech in 2021 couldn’t be far from different. With a European Union still struggling with vaccination and COVID-19, we had no clue of the events lying ahead for 2022. Still, there is a certain resemblance on topics such as the rule of law, which was again praised by Ursula Von der Leyen in this year’s address. Based on the President’s words, the conditionality mechanism is here to stay and will have a key role in the future in order to access EU funding. Another topic that was repeated this year is the compromise with climate change and the digitalisation of Europe.
Among key achievements we could highlight the creation of theHealth Emergency Response Authority(HERA), theConference on the Future of Europe,REPowerEU,Digital Services Packageor EUsanctionpackages to Russia.
The State of the Union speech, as the event that starts the political season, is of key relevance since it brings forward an expected roadmap for the coming months. Additionally, it is shortly followed by the publication of theCommission Work Programme, which includes further information on the proposals. The programme for 2023 is available from 18th October 2022.
Considering the circumstances that we are facing; it would be safe to keep low expectations on the achievements of the European Union for the coming year. The Ukrainian war combined with political turmoil and surging COVID-19 and seasonal influenza infections leaves little room for improvisation. It is also necessary to keep in mind the upcoming European elections in 2024. This means that 2023 will be the last full political year before a new president of the Commission and European Parliament are elected.
As it has happened in the last months, it is expected that geopolitical developments will shape the European agenda. Relevant milestones in the global arena and continuous crises are expected to leave no margin of action for member states, who are already facing pressing circumstances. Additionally, it is yet to be seen how new governments integrate within the European Union and shift existing supporting blocs. For now, it is enough to imagine how Europe will look like by September 2023.

Polar Power Plays: Is the EU’s Arctic Policy Still Relevant?,"In 1987,Mikhail Gorbachev termedthe Arctic as “the pole of peace.” This has held mostly true for the past thirty-five years, but recent events have shown that the Arctic is increasingly becoming a geopolitical chessboard. A growing number of countries have expressed interest in the region, most notably China, which considers itself a “near-Arctic state,” a term thatChina explains asconstituting “one of the continental States that are closest to the Arctic Circle.” This interest stems from the Arctic’s strategic location and thinning ice – the circumpolar shipping routes aresignificantly shorter and fasterthan traditional routes – as well as its vast energy resources.
The Arctic harbors30% of global undiscovered gas reserves and 13% of undiscovered oil, amounting to 22% of the unexplored natural resources of our planet. In addition, the region is the fastest way to deliver missiles from the United States to Europe. All this goes to show that this area plays a strategically important role in geopolitics.
The EU published its updatedArctic strategyon October 13, 2021. Since then, we have witnessed the unfolding of the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, the increasingly visible effects of climate change, the growing presence of Russia and China in the Arctic, and the announcement of Finland and Sweden joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), rendering all but one of the Arctic Eight – the eight countries bordering the region – members of NATO. Nevertheless, the EU has not formally revised its circumpolar strategy accordingly. Building on this, this article provides a closer analysis of the EU’s regional policy in light of current challenges and poses some questions for future reflection.
As mentioned by theEEAS, the EU’s Arctic policy:
“aims to help preserve the Arctic as a region of peaceful cooperation, to slow the effects of climate change, and to support the sustainable development of Arctic regions to the benefit of Arctic communities, not least Indigenous Peoples, and future generations.”
This statement also highlights the main priorities for the EU in the Arctic: preserving peaceful cooperation, slowing down climate change, and supporting sustainable development. The European Green Deal constitutes the core of the EU’s Arctic aspirations, paired with theEU’s sustainable blue economyplans. The EU thus harbors predominantly soft power priorities centred around the climate and the environment and the Union does not mention anything about a possible strategic presence. The furthestthe 2021 Joint Communicationgoes on this topic is to state that it will develop “strategic foresight on emerging security challenges.” These and all other mentions of the word ‘security’ are in the context of climate concerns and the monitoring thereof and remain rather general.
Climate change continues to be the most pressing challenge in the Arctic region as the repercussions of global warming are most visible in the circumpolar region. The strong climate focus of the EU’s Arctic policy is therefore highly timely. However, the war in Ukraine is increasingly posing more and more challenges to engagement in the Arctic region. The economic consequences of the war are, for example, impacting the progress and priority position of the Green Deal, as well as the EU’s imports of minerals and energy. The EU is mainly occupied with resolving its internal challenges for the time being as it needs to send a clear signal to its citizens that their well-being prevails over the Union’s geopolitical aspirations. If it fails to do so, it would only further fuel Euroscepticism and the rise of populist governments within member states.
In addition, Russia has been excluded from key collaborative infrastructure in the Arctic, such as the Arctic Council, bringing about a deadlock in circumpolar cooperation. This can, in turn,undermine the Union’sactivities including maritime research, data collection and monitoring of the climate in the region, as data on a significant part of the Arctic would be omitted.
Another key pillar of the Union’s Arctic policy is international cooperation, meaning that the EU’s circumpolar engagement has also been key in the cultivation of its relations with Russia and increasingly also with China. It allowed for peaceful cooperation on various aspects, such as people-to-people interactions with Indigenous peoples and businesses as well as scientific cooperation. These joint EU-Russian efforts have now come to a standstill and there are no prospects of a revival in the near future.
The EU is undoubtedly an Arctic player as several of its member states, and close allies, are part of the Arctic Eight and it has economic association agreements with others including Norway and Iceland. Hence, its approach should reflect this. In light of current challenges, it can be concluded that the EU’s Arctic policy is relatively underdeveloped and predominantly one-sided. In theEU’s Strategic Compass, published on March 21, 2022, almost one month after the invasion of Ukraine, there are only three references to the Arctic, centered around global warming, maritime security, and environmental challenges. It is striking that the EU did not include more outspoken aspirations for its Arctic engagement on a strategic level. In a similar vein, the EU has not yet formally amended its Arctic policy to reflect the current geopolitical climate in the region. Nevertheless, in September 2022, the EU appointed a Special Envoy for regional matters with the following purpose:
“to drive forward the EU’s Arctic policy, enhance cooperation with partner countries and other interested parties, improve coordination between the different EU institutions, mainstream Arctic issues in policy-making, and promote and publicise the EU’s Arctic engagement externally.”
This is an important development as due to the standstill of Arctic cooperation between Russia and the West, the role of the EU in the region could become ever more important in the context of closer cooperation between the Western Arctic states.
The EU is predominantly a soft power in the region. Hence, it should not pursue hard military objectives in the Arctic as it simply does not possess these capabilities. This should be left to NATO. Rather, the EU could channel its existing instruments to bolster a stronger yet peaceful Arctic presence. For example, it could include a more outspoken Arctic dimension under the banner of its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). This could also entail a specific budget for regional engagement under theEuropean Defence Fund, which supports “research and development of state-of-the-art and interoperable defense and technology equipment.” This would allow the EU to preserve its soft-power orientation without sparking too much debate among the Member States, and still getting more involved with the strategic side of the coin.
Overall, many of the Union’s Arctic policy objectives remain pertinent in light of current challenges. However, its strategy could be supplemented by adding another dimension to better reflect current realities as this would allow the EU to better prepare itself in case tensions in the region start to rise further. Nevertheless, it could also be possible that the EU is currently keeping a limited profile in the region to not further upset Russia. Seven of the eight Arctic countries are now part of NATO and if the EU – home to several circumpolar countries and close partner of the United States andCanada– would also start to play a bigger strategic role in the region, this could further deepen the divide between the two sides and increase tensions which would also affect Indigenous Peoples living across the Western and Russian parts of the Arctic.
By means of emphasizing climate action, the EU could provide fertile ground to restart some form of peaceful Arctic cooperation, and this prospect could be endangered if the EU were to take on a more strategic role. In addition, by emphasizing climate change and peaceful cooperation, the Union might try to counterbalance the narrative of the increasing militarization of the circumpolar region. Nevertheless, the EU should beware of not losing track of the region now that it is increasingly diverting resources towards Eastern Europe. It thus remains to be seen whether and how the EU will adapt its circumpolar presence in the near future.

Rethinking Agroecological Policies: The ProHuerta Program,"According to theMinistry of Social Development of Argentina, the main objective of ProHuerta is “to improve food sovereignty, favour the participation and organization of vulnerable sectors of the population and promote the commercialization of surpluses.” In addition, it promoted the development of “alternative markets with an inclusive outlook.”
The program was designed and implemented by the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) together with the National Ministry of Social Development. Meanwhile, its implementation falls on the Secretariat of Social Inclusion, and, based onofficial information, it is implemented under five central strategies: 1) promotion of orchards and agroecological farms (family, school and community); 2) technical assistance and training; 3) food and environmental education; 4) strengthening of productive projects and access to water; 5) support for marketing through local markets and popular fairs.
Broadly speaking, it has more than 630,000 orchards and 130,000 farms that contribute to food access for more than 3.5 million people. With a national scope, it has a territorial presence in 88% of the country’s municipalities. In addition, it has a network of 20,000 volunteer promoters who contribute to territorial work, connecting with the population and solving problems.
Over the years, ProHuerta has been recognized internationally as a successful policy in self-production and food sovereignty. The program’s experience has been promoted in various ways, being replicated in countries like Haiti, as well as taken as an “example policy” during the Latin American Course on Food Self-Production, Food Security and Local Development. This course was sponsored by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) with the goal of increasing the technical and methodological capacities of the representatives of different countries in the region for the generation and implementation of policies, strategies, programs and projects for food security and local development.
To understand some of the issues ProHuerta is facing nowadays, it is important to recognize the historical context in which the program was developed. During the 1980s, Argentina was in a complex economic and social situation caused by decades of military dictatorship and successive economic crises that reached a critical point with hyperinflation during the government of Raúl Alfonsín, and continued with various processes of structural economic adjustments. It is in this scenario that ProHuerta was conceived and implemented. Therefore, it can be thought as a policy of welfare that, due to its success and sustenance over time, gradually became a development policy.
Furthermore, the program was designed to mitigate the economic situation that affected the mostvulnerable groupsin society. Thus, a demographic cut can be observed, privileging families with children under 14 years of age, pregnant women, disabled people, and adults over 70 years of age who live in socially unfavourable conditions, and present a situation of nutritional vulnerability as the target population. In other words, the program had – at first – the main objective of preventing this social sector from falling into indigence.
For this reason, the central focus of the program was to promote family farming,understood as“a type of production in which the domestic unit and the productive unit are physically integrated. Agriculture is the main occupation and source of income for the family group and the family contributes the predominant fraction of the labour force.”
As it was said before, with the passage of time, PruHuerta was re-signified towards a more developmentalist perspective. It began to be presented as a new productive alternative to the modern agricultural system – characterized by the monopoly of production, monoculture and the development of biotechnologies – that enhance mass-production to the detriment of individuals and the environment.
Taking this stance in theory did not necessarily translate into practice. This is evidenced, mainly since the 1900s, in the complications observed in various localities at a national level; regarding the commercialization of the surplus, both in the lack of official retail spaces and in the legal figure that should be assigned to the ProHuerta farmers. What is observed in several cases is a “bottleneck” effect since the producers are not registered as they remain excluded from the official sales circuit, replicating the initial exclusion conditions of the population in question.
An example of this problem is the case study byFeítoon the situation in the La Matanza district where it was concluded that “La Matanza’s agricultural sector has little connection with the rest of the party’s economy, lacking recognition from local authorities. The inclusion of this sector in a sustained development strategy aimed at social inclusion, the economic sustainability of local production and the respect and sustainable use of natural resources is still pending.”
The development of public policies is a non-linear process of constant transformation. Therefore, it must be restructured whenever necessary to continue covering and responding to the population’s problems. In the case of ProHuerta, the program was successful in the self-sufficiency stage, however, it was unable to respond to the sale of the surplus – a problem that occurred as a result of its implementation. The main issue is that both the lack of regularization of the legal status of the farmers and the absence of spaces for exchange and sale, thereby limiting their capacity for action and profit.
The need to establish a new problem-solution relationship that reconstructs the forms of intervention and the strategies that ProHuerta entails is clear. First, the new demands and interests of the actors are, if their needs have changed – from self-cultivation to commercialization – must build alternatives so that the program acquires functionality. Second, there is a need to adapt to current needs to remaining a leading policy in the region.","January 20, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/rethinking-agroecological-policies-the-prohuerta-program/,Carola López,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The Return of Direct Democracy? A look at the double-edged sword in Latin America,"The idea of “one person one vote” has not been practical or doable for centuries for multiple reasons. Instead, we have moved to systems of representative democracy in most arenas, with certain exceptions, such as the United National General Assembly. Nonetheless, the application of direct democracy is still present and constantly put to use through instruments such as plebiscites and referendums, and any popular consultations. These tools have been used in many situations by governments around the entire globe in recent years, such as the famous Brexit referendum. This article will focus on the use of these tools in Latin America, especially in the two countries with the most frequent use of direct democracy: Uruguay and Ecuador.
Direct democracy and its application in modern societies have been questioned multiple times, especially regarding whether people voting actually translates directly into better decision-making. On these questions, some argue that giving people the power to make decisions directly provokes poorer outcomes. Others contend that, by definition, public consultations cannot be a failure as their results are a direct reflection of the population’s desires. An article published in 2016 byThe Economistargues that direct democracy is a double-edged sword and its successful application will depend not only on the voting procedure when the consultation actually takes place but also on the previous bureaucratic aspects, such as who is allowed to bring forward a referendum proposal and what are the requirements to make it happen. An additional concern regards the use and misuse of instruments of direct democracy by those in power to legitimize their perspectives, and thus justify their decision-making. This, can provoke complications and alter the equilibrium in systems based on checks and balances.
Direct democracy often brings up the celebrated idea of “one country one vote” as illustrated by the UN General Assembly. However, when looking at the calls for referendums and other public consultations, it is important to also understand the background of the situation and why that particular topic or law is deemed to need a special process for decision-making. One must also consider the wording of the questions presented to the voters and whether those represent issues in complete control of the government. An additional factor to keep in mind is the levels of accountability that the country presents regarding the results of referendums.
One interesting example is the 2016 referendum on thePeace Agreementin Colombia. Once the agreement had been drafted, Colombians over the age of 18 were asked to vote yes or no on its approval in order to make it official. After a voting process with an extremely narrow margin of difference,50.2% of the populationdecided they did not agree with the document, voting no in the referendum. Nonetheless, after minor changes, then-president Juan Manuel Santos still moved forward on the peace process with theFuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia(FARC) and made the agreement official. Thus bringing up the question of whether the referendum was even useful.
Referendums and plebiscites are not uncommon in the LATAM region. However, two countries stand out due to the frequent use of direct democracy: Uruguay and Ecuador. Although these two nations are similar in how often citizens go to the polls, their constitutions and law conceive referendums and plebiscites differently.
On the one hand, Uruguay is often celebrated as a champion of democracy in the region, and especially as a champion of the use of direct democracy. In the last century, Uruguayans have gone to the polls more than 25 times in cases of popular consultations. Some have argued that the high frequency of these events could have negative consequences and wear down people’s willingness and desire to participate, as well as to question whether their high frequency is a reflection of deficiencies in their representative democracy. However, it is important to notice here that although the terms referendum and plebiscite are often used interchangeably, these have different legal and practical connotations in Uruguay. According to the constitution, plebiscites are not tools of direct democracy, rather they are the last step in the process of constitutional reform. In other words, in cases of changes to the constitution, Uruguayan law requires a plebiscite to take place. Referendums, on the other hand, are instruments of direct democracy and serve to change legislation partially or completely. For a referendum to take place in Uruguay, 25% of voters must signal their agreement with the process. Historically, Uruguay has participated in referendums mostly brought about or proposed by the people in order to reduce conflict levels and address social disputes, such as the legality of abortion and protections for LGBTQ+ populations, among others.
In the case of Ecuador, what jumps out is not necessarily the difference in terminology but how the bureaucratic requirements to move forward with a referendum could favor some proponents over others. According to the 2008 Constitution, a popular consultation can be proposed by the executive power, the National Assembly, local governments, or the general population. However, while the president only needs to receive approval from the Constitutional Court regarding the legality of the questions, when a referendum is proposed by the people, they must collect signatures supporting their referendum, which must be equal to 5% of the electorate. This bureaucratic difference according to Sofia Velasco Ayala, a researcher on direct democracy, contributes to consultations coming from the president’s office, to be much more likely to move forward and reach the voting phase. In fact, Ecuador is the country with the highest rate of referendums called by the executive power in the LATAM region.
The cases of these two countries highlight two interesting facts. One, as made evident by the Uruguayan case, despite the extensive development of theory and literature, we are still not defining and applying concepts related to democracy in the same way in the region, let alone in the world. Thus, comparisons regarding the frequency of application of direct democracy might not be the most appropriate to understand the state of our democracies. Second, while in Uruguay most referendums are proposed by the people, in Ecuador most come from the president. This dichotomy stands out as some argue that while in Uruguay direct democracy is being used to open more space for people to voice their opinions, inEcuadorthe same tool is used to legitimate the decisions of those in power when other legislative structures disagree or are blocked due to political motives.

(Analysis) The Origins of American Strategy in Latin America: Monroe to Globalization,"The United States has long maintained a foreign policy that considersLatin Americaas its sphere of influence. This policy can be traced back as early as1823when then-President James Monroe gave an address to Congress in which he stated, “The American continents, are henceforth not be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.” At this time the U.S. was not the regional hegemon that it would eventually become but a nation that was one of many in the Americas which were inspired byEnlightenment-era idealsto engage in the project ofrepublicanismaway from the monarchies of the Old World.
The first consideration of an unofficial invocation was during the American Civil War as France had installed Archduke Maximillian of Austria in place of Benito Juarez, who had paused payments of foreign debts because of the nation’s inability to do so. The installation of a puppet government by the French within Mexico was perceived as a direct affront to the position of not allowing foreign powers to interfere in the affairs of American states. Due to the domestic conditions which were brought about by the Civil War, Secretary of State William H. Seward gave aresponseto the French in which he expressed the nation’s position on the matter but failed to convey any measures which provided any assurance of American involvement to deter the French. It would not be until the administration ofAndrew Johnsonthat the French would withdraw from Mexico with U.S. support.
Subsequently, the policy which would come to define the contemporary relationship between the U.S. and Latin America would be theRoosevelt Corollary. In this expansion of theMonroe Doctrine, the U.S. no longer viewed itself as one of many American states engaged in the shared experience of defeating thegreat powersof the Old World to govern themselves in the spirit of republicanism, but as the sole and rightful guarantor of stability, as well as property, within the Americas. Though an antiquated sentiment by the standards of today, the corollary was predicated upon the U.S. being perceived as a peer state to European powers and acting as acivilizing presencewithin the Americas. The United States had viewed itself as the natural choice for being a hegemonic power due to its self-perceived view of its political development. The position the U.S. sought to occupy proved attractive to European powers as it freed them to pursue their political and economic interests elsewhere without having to contribute resources. Moreover, these great powers were in the midst of global conflicts, like the Napoleonic Wars and the Seven Years’ War, that occurred in the region they ascribed the highest degree of political prestige to.
While invoking the language of keeping the Americas free from foreign interference, the U.S. did not seek stability for the preservation of republicanism as an imperative to further delineate the region from the monarchies of Europe. Instead, the U.S. saw its relations with neighboring states within aneconomic orientationthat favored American commerce which emulated the same economic policies of the European monarchies from which they had gained independence. This was especially true in the early 20th century, whendollar diplomacyunder the supervision of Secretary of State Philander C. Knox, sought domestic and foreign investments in Latin America and framed the policy as a peaceful endeavour.
By the time the Cold War began, the threat of nuclear war and thezero-sumnature of the Cold War were based on whether capitalism or communism would be the order of the day. Communism found an audience in Latin America because its DNA consisted ofpopulist elementswhich cloaked itself with the language ofanti-imperialismwhich was congruent with the historic struggles against their colonial masters and put the poor at the forefront. The impoverishment of Latin America had not equally reaped the benefits ofindustrializationand were also not beneficiaries of large estates asland inequalitywas persistent among American states. Additionally, Latin American states would come to see their insurrection as a second revolution that sought to rectify the lack ofsocial reformswhich failed to manifest after theWars of Spanish-American Independencethat had afforded them their sovereignty.
Heightened anxiety in the early Cold War which befell American policymakers not only permeated the United States domestically with the surveillance enacted by FBI directorJ. Edgar Hooverbut also in the foreign policy of the U.S. with the ardent cold warrior,John Foster Dulles, who presided over the State Department under the Eisenhower administration. The manifestation of the anti-communist crusade conducted by SenatorJoseph McCarthywas the result of such anxiety about possible communist subversion in the U.S. Additionally, American firms became entrenched within the politics and economies of Latin America, particularly within Central America. The most infamous American firm, theUnited Fruit Companyhad become an entity compared in power to historic multinational companies such as theBritish East India Company. The company’s power at its greatest height was reflected in its ability to haveoustedgovernments that they found counter-productive to its interests in the states in which it had operations. Among those who they deposed was Guatemalan PresidentJacobo Arbenzin 1954 who attempted land reforms within his country.
The sum of their fears was realized when President John F. Kennedy wasnotifiedof the intentions of the Soviets to place nuclear missiles, which were capable of reaching the U.S., on October 16th, 1962. Under the Casto regime, relations between Cuba and the United States were extremely fraught as the America aided anti-communist elements within Cuban society in the botchedBay of Pigsinvasion. Castro would then seek further alignment with the USSR through theadoptionof Soviet positions on international issues to seeknuclear weapons, the ultimate deterrent from an invasion by a foreign power. Such actions would prompt the United States to proclaim anembargoto isolate the Castro regime. President Kennedy would then go on to address the United States via televisionseven dayslater, setting in motion a naval blockade around the island to deter the Soviets from delivering more materials to complete the construction of Soviet missile sites in Cuba. The world would hold its breath for thirteen days as the world’s two nuclear superpowers had a standoff that brought them to the prospect of nuclear war. The crisis’ resolution would ultimately be aided by the efforts ofAttorney GeneralRobert F. Kennedy through his role as an advisor as well as hisdiplomaticefforts with the Soviets to de-escalate the crisis.
For those Americanofficialswho lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as their successors who would continue their work in the twilight of the Cold War, heighten geopolitical crisis in America’s backyard left a lasting impression upon U.S. officials, thereby affecting future U.S. foreign policy. In the aftermath of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, the U.S., under the Nixon presidency, and the USSR began talks about the creation of what would become theSALT Treatiesdue to the unmitigated devastation which could have been brought hadn’t the Cuban Missile Crisis been resolved. The prospect of having a hostile nuclear-capable state once again having operational capabilities to strike at the U.S. and the residual fear from the Cuban Missile Crisis would drive policymakers to keep communism out of the hemisphere. A potential implication of a failure to prevent the deployment of nuclear weapons in Cuba would be the erosion of American prestige within the Americas. Such an erosion would provide the Soviets an avenue for influence in the region as Latin American states did not have the same means as the U.S. to prevent a potential forward operating base for the Soviets.
The role of domestic politics would also factor into the decision-making of subsequent presidents as letting the Soviets put the U.S. in a compromising position again would prove politically disastrous. These implications would manifest in the confrontational posture President Reagan would take toward the spread of communism and Soviet interference in Latin America through hisdoctrine, resulting in his administration invading the small Caribbean island of Grenada topreventa potential base of operations for the USSR to expand its Latin American presence. This imperative to stop the spread of communism had a domestic focus as well with Reagan waging acampaignagainst narcotics which he saw as tools of subversion utilized by Marxist regimes. Reagan took these beliefs to their logical conclusion of the application of his doctrine in theallocationof aid to the Nicaraguan contras to overthrow the government of Nicaragua.
The administration of George H.W. Bush proved pivotal for contemporary US-Latin American relations through its pursuit of multilateralism. Moreover, this new era of American engagement in the hemisphere occurred during the fall of the Soviet Union and lent expectations from Latin America that the U.S. would break from polarizing actions such as interventions. However, hawkish tendencies which dominated the republican administrations of the Cold War would be shown in theinvasionof Panama to protect American interests as relations between both governments deteriorated. George H.W. Bush would also lay the legal groundwork for globalization which would be upended by COVID-19 through multilateral agreements such asNAFTA.
The nations that comprise the Americas share a common history of engaging in an experiment of self-determination in opposition to the rigid socioeconomic norms that they inherited from the empires that they gained independence from. While they share this common story, the United States developed an asymmetrical role within the hemisphere and viewed its neighbors in a different light than it had previously done during its infancy. Since the founding of these republics, there have been many impediments to this lofty vision of a hemisphere of states of mutual standing dedicated to the ideals of republicanism.
This vision of Republicanism across the region was one that was idyllic but often confronted with internal and external issues that have stifled the region’s political development. The history of how the U.S. still looms in the minds of Latin American states and the region is once again divided among who Latin American states align with. Although their shared origins of republicanism are a foundational connection, diplomatic relations have drifted into a distant memory. It is up to the United States and Latin America to strive toward the ideals that inspired their creation. However, this process will have to be largely initiated by the U.S. due to its hegemonic position within the hemisphere it has exerted to maintain it.

(Analysis) Nuclear Energy Embraced & Shunned Simultaneously Within The EU,"As winter continues to approach the cost of energy continues to be an important issue discussed by national politicians. Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine has led to an energy shortage as European Union member states race to find alternative energy sources outside from Russia. For better or for worse, this is yet another area where member states tend to disagree.
While the European Union guides the energy policy and labels certain sources as sustainable, member states must decide their own national energy policy, results in diverse approaches as some members embrace nuclear energy meanwhile others continue to shy away from it. What is clear, however, is that EU nations must work on energy policies to address inflation.
Inflation in theEurozonehit a record high of 10.6 percent in October of 2022 and it has, without a doubt, contributed to slower economic growth than the once forecasted for this year. As the EU’s goal through numerous rounds of sanctions on Moscow was to cripple the Russian economy, it is clear that member states need to find alternative and reliable, yet cheap, energy sources. EU states need to wean themselves off of Russian oil and gas. However, this is easier said than done. For instance, some member states choose to shorten or completely cut the amount of time national monuments are illuminated at night, cutting the amount of time Christmas lights will be on, and most importantly, setting a limit on themaximum temperaturefor heat in homes this winter in order to preserve energy reserves.
Italy is an interesting case when it comes to the discussion of nuclear energy. Historically, it was one of the largest producers of nuclear energy in Europe and the world. In 1966 the country was thethird largest produceronly behind the United States and the United Kingdom. Nuclear power was initially introduced in Italy to help support the rapid industrial growth that occurred after World War II. At that time it was considered the nation’s best option for autonomous economic growth, similar to the logic that other member states are now using to justify the construction of nuclear reactors. This, however, changed after theChornobyl incident. The Italian government at the time decided to hold a referendum on nuclear energy, with a majority of those who participated voting against it. A second referendum was held in 2011 after the Fukushima disaster with the public once again rejecting the idea of reintroducing nuclear energy to Italy.
While nuclear energy may be a cheaper energy source, it still can be incredibly dangerous. A decision from theEuropean Court of Justiceearlier this year paved the way for Italy to tap into gas and oil deposits off the coast of the Puglia region — in the Adriatic sea — yet Italians are resistant to this idea. Although a potential disaster could be devastating for the environment and to the tourism industry, Italy’s new governing coalition isexpandingthe number of permits for drilling in the Adriatic sea.
55 percentof all gas that Germany imported came from Russia before the war and the nation’s struggle to replace it is clear from Germany’s fast-evolving energy policy. While Germany still has some nuclear reactors in use — the Green party which is part of the governing coalition — is still committed to phasing them out. Similar to Italy, there is a lot of pushback on nuclear power. This has been delayed due to Germany’s energy needs. The nation has postponed decommissioning the remaining three reactors to April 2023. The reactors Isar 2, Emsland, and Neckarwestheim 2 will all be available for use until April 15th, unless their decommissioning is deferred again. All three were originally scheduled to be shut down by the end of 2022 but this has been rescheduled in order to prevent an energy shortage. From January to July of 2021 nuclear energy generated 12.4 percent of the nation’s electricity while also dropping to 6 percent in the same period during 2022.
Germany also had to restart coal energy plants. While coal is a very cheap energy source it is one of the most polluting as well, double the emissions of gas and 60 times the emissions of nuclear energy. Germany plans to phase out coal completely by 2030. In the first half of this year alone, coal produced a third of all electricity in Germany, an increase of 27 percent from the first six months of 2021.
Looking at France’s energy production in 2022, it is possible to see that nuclear energy certainly has its own problems and is not a solution without any drawbacks. Due to lower rainfall than normal, French rivers ran so low that France had to cut the operating capacity of its nuclear reactors in order to prevent damage to wildlife. If the temperature or flow of the river is too low this can have environmental consequences which led to limits being set in 2003 after France experienced another heat wave. EDF also had to shut down half of France’s nuclear reactors due to scheduled maintenance. This maintenance was supposed to take place in 2020 but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
As there are concerns over reaching higher temperatures in Europe, member states will need to consider this when deliberating on adding or expanding nuclear energy as part of their energy policy. President Macron fully intends for nuclear energy to help France becomecarbon neutral, but this is easier said than done. France has 56 reactors more than any other nation in the EU. Due to the required maintenance of half of the reactors, France went from being Europe’s largest energy exporter to an importer. France plans on building six new reactors for a total cost of50 billion euros, which critics say can be spent on more environmentally friendly sources that would not take as long to build. The aim is to have the first new reactor operational by 2035, leaving France vulnerable to the unstable energy prices the continent is currently experiencing.
While some nations are against nuclear energy or have seen the drawbacks, Poland is determined to start producing nuclear power by 2033 and have six reactors operational by 2043. There is some skepticism about whether this is achievable within the state timeline.Jakub Wiech, deputy editor-in-chief ofEnergetyka24.com, believes that 2033 is too ambitious as delays are normal in the construction of a nuclear reactor, particularly when it is a country’s first.Westinghouse, an American company will build Poland’s first nuclear reactor with an estimated price tag of 20 billion dollars, said the reactor will be located in Choczewo — 80 kilometres west of Gdansk. Poland hopes this will reduce its dependence on coal. Currently, coal is responsible for 70 percent of the nation’s energy. Simultaneously the Polish government is working with KHNP, a South Korean company to build another nuclear reactor, which would be located in the center of the country.
Poland had ambitions for nuclear energy in the 1980s but did not have the financial resources to pursue this dream. The plan was also put on hold due to the Chornobyl incident. If Poland’s nuclear energy aspirations are successful now, nuclear energy could produce as much as 30 percent of the nation’s total energy. Besides nuclear, the country is looking to invest in biomass, solar polar, and wind as other sources to reduce its dependency on coal. This would be beneficial for the country as it has run into legal trouble for its coal use. Due to pollution from theTurów coal mine, Poland was ordered by the European Court of Justice to seize operations or pay a daily fine of 500,000 euros. Poland has refused to pay the fine despite continuing operations and instead made a deal with the Czech government for 45 million euros.
Hungary, like Poland, is also working on nuclear energy production. While Poland has taken a strong stance against Russia as a consequence of the invasion of Ukraine, Hungary is working with a Russian company in order to expand its nuclear capabilities.Rosatam, a Russian state-owned company, will construct two nuclear reactors in Hungary. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that the plan is to have both nuclear reactors operational by 2030. Hungary also notably held up the sixth round of EU sanctions in May. Brussels was wishfully optimistic and thought that this round of sanctions would be passed in a matter of days yet instead almost took the entire month. Thepurposeof this round of sanctions was to ban seaborne crude oil and petroleum products. Prime Minister Viktor Orban was adamant that Hungary could not commit to a timeline to find alternative sources of gas or oil other than Russia as the rest of the member states agreed to in that round of sanctions. Unlike Poland, Hungary has already been producing nuclear energy. Hungary currently has one nuclear reactor in Paks that was built during the 1980s.
Armenians are angry at what they perceive to be a double standard. The EU has been vocal about finding other countries to import oil from other than Russia due to the devastation in Ukraine. On the other hand, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan have increased again and EU member states are importing Azerbaijani energy as an alternative to Russian energy. This puts the Brussels in a difficult situation as it has been calling for nations not to buy energy from Russia while purchasing energy from Azerbaijan. When questioned if the bloc would prevent money sent to Azerbaijan for energy from being spent on human rights violations or conflict, the Brussels responded by stating “the EU does not exercise control over the spending of trade revenues of the third country from legitimate commercial oil and gas operations with the EU Member States.” This appears to create a double standard. The EU is trying to prevent Russia from receiving payment for gas and oil to be potentially spent on the brutality in Ukraine, while simultaneously, Armenia and Azerbaijan have seen bloodshed with over200killed in late September in skirmishes on the border. The situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot be directly compared to the invasion of Ukraine but arguably money sent to Azerbaijan by the EU can be used to continue the conflict with Armenia leading to more casualties.
Unfortunately for European Union member states, there is no clear strategy to rapidly and cheaply replace Russian energy, which has led to difficult decisions with finding alternative energy sources. For some member states, this means nuclear energy is an option while others want to decommission any existing reactors or have already done so years ago and do not desire to reinvest. Every energy source has positive and negative aspects. This makes it difficult for states to attempt to craft their energy policies in a way that can provide cheap energy with keeping emission mitigation in mind as well.","December 27, 2022",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-nuclear-energy-embraced-shunned-simultaneously-within-the-eu/,Nicholas Zalewski,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"European Migration Policy, Still Pending?","On recent plenary debates, the European People’s Party President Manfred Webberhighlightedthe importance of concluding the migration negotiations. It is fair to agree that in 2022 the flow of refugees saw an increase due to the unexpected invasion of Ukraine. However, deaths in the Mediterranean routes and conflicts on disembarkment of rescue ships are still on top of the agenda in many EU member states.
In September 2020, the European Union approved thePact on Migration and Asylum.This initiative responded to the challenges identified during the 2015-16 migration crisis. In the 2015-2016State of the Union Speechaddressed by European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, she noted the importance of the solidarity component to share the burden of migration that the member states at the external border of the European Union suffered. Additionally, she agreed that saving lives at the sea was not an option, actions needed to be taken beforehand.
This pact proposed a long list of initiatives including a revision of theEURODAC Regulation, aproposalfor a regulation on asylum and migration management (AMR), aproposalfor a screening regulation, aproposalfor an asylum procedures Regulation (APR), a new crisisinstrumentand a Migration Preparedness and Crisis Blueprint. However, despite the wide spectrum of the initiatives, the occurrence of events like COVID-19, whose recovery and consequences expanded throughout 2021, plus the Ukrainian war seem to have stolen the spotlight.
To this date, there are only so many of these initiatives that came to completion. For example, in December 2021, theEuropean Union Agency for Asylumcame into place. According to the available information, thisagencyis “mandated with supporting member states in applying the package of EU laws that governs asylum, international protection and reception conditions, known as the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).” However, a brief look into its legal basis suggests how outdated the migration legislation is at the European level. Most instruments were approved in the early 2010s, long before the migratory crisis. After that, critical issues like relocation mechanisms or the principle of solidarity have sparked disagreements between member state, resulting in stalled negotiations around the Pact. On the lastSpecial EUCOthat took place in February, President Ursula Von Der Leyen gave a speech reporting the advances made in regards to thePact on Asylum and Migration.
Only in November 2022, Italy and France disagreed over the fate of around 200 migrants that were docked in French ports after Italy’s refusal to accept them. In retaliation, France rejected to relocate 3000 migrants that were initially hosted by Italy. This incident shows how embedded the topic is in the political agenda of EU states.
Another proof of the controversies surrounding the topic is the institutionalization of migration. The clearest example is the current migratory crisis on theBelarusian border. This crisis started in July 2021 following the democratic demise of Belarus and thethreatsreceived by President Alexander Lukashenko to “flood the EU with human traffickers, armed migrants, and drug smugglers.” In a similar fashion, Morocco has put considerable pressure on Spain. The famous incident in 2021, where Moroccan authorities opened gates for thousands of migrants to access Melilla, has been followed by continuous attempts to jump over the fences that separate European territory from Morocco, specifically in the cities of Melilla and Ceuta.
In the latest attempt to revive the migratory agenda, the European Commission published a communication titledAttracting skills and talent to the EUin April 2022. The idea of this report is to build an EU legal migration policy based on legislative, operational, and future-oriented policy measures that focus on the transition of the labor market to green and digital economies by integrating economic migration. Some of the measures that this communication has triggered are the digitalization of the visa procedure or the single permit directive, which would allow migrants to use one single procedure to file for work and residence. Additionally, the EU has been working on roadmaps to tackle migration challenges in the most common routes to access Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Western Balkans.
The apparent downside of this initiative is that it addresses migration from a purely economic point of view, thus disregarding the wide variety of reasons why a person would become a migrant. Additionally, the “validity” and “utility” of migrants are based on how well they can serve the European labor market and how they can help invert the demographic trend of an aging population. This approach leaves many structural deficiencies of the current EU migration policy uncovered and does not provide protection to the biggest group of migrants, which are often women and children. Still, given the political component of migration, it seems 2023 will start with no substantial developments in the matter.
It is worth mentioning that the critical difference between the approaches to the Ukrainian war and other conflicts is the political will behind it. It’s critical to assess how the EU has responded to the Ukrainian conflict and try to keep such an approach to other conflicts. A consistent approach towards migration would ensure that public opinion doesn’t perceive some crises as more important than others and most of all, that refugees only matter based on where they come from. The remaining objective for the EU is to be able to respond to migratory crises on time, to be able to build preparedness beforehand, and to put a robust system into place that addresses the lifecycle of migration, from the first relocation to reception and integration in local communities. 2023 could be the year we could finally see some of the proposed legislative measures coming into place. For that, we need strong political voices, willing to unlock the disagreements between member states. Migration should be understood not as an individual choice but as a response to circumstances and the EU’s responsibility is to ensure an appropriate response to it before it becomes another crisis.

(Analysis) The Return of Hard Geopolitics: Towards a New Era of EU-Japan Strategic Cooperation?,"In the past, relations between the European Union (EU) and Japan were largely characterized by an “expectations deficit,” where both actors were relatively uninterested in each other because they did not harbor any expectations towards one another. The EU was mainly preoccupied with internal politics and deepening integration and was still largely an economic player with little engagement regarding foreign policy, especially when it came to remote areas like the Indo-Pacific. Foreign policy was also an entirely national competence for a long time, leaving little room for the Union to act in this regard. This changed over time, with the introduction of theCommon Foreign and Security Policy, theCommon Security and Defence Policyand the increasing role of the European External Action Service and EU Delegations worldwide.
Japan, on the other hand, was unsure about what the EU exactly constituted and why they should engage with it. This is not bewildering as the EU can be considered neither a conventional international organization nor a sovereign entity. Japan has always engaged with individual member states, likeGermanyandFrance, and preferred to keep it that way. Moreover, Japan’s foreign policy was long characterized by theYoshida Doctrine, which asserted a low-profile, economically oriented diplomatic stance and uni-dimensional foreign policy. When the late Shinzo Abe became the Japanese Prime Minister for the first time in 2006, he ushered in anew era of Japanese foreign policy, marked by a revolutionary more open approach to the international arena. This significantly affected Japan’s interest in the EU.
Japan and the EU deepened their relations considerably over the last decades. Cooperation started to increase with the1991Hague Declarationand the2001Joint Action Plan. More recently, the EU-JapanEconomic Partnership Agreement(EPA) andStrategic Partnership Agreement(SPA) and thePartnership on Sustainable Connectivity and Quality Infrastructurewere either signed or enforced in 2019. These documents outlined how the two actors could move closer and promote their shared values in the context of increasing globalization and rising autocratic powers.
“The fact that the EU and Japan share a host of fundamental values like democracy, the rule of law and human rights and are both dedicated to maintaining the liberal and rules-based international order along with other like-minded partners constitutes the foundation for the EU-Japan partnership.”
However, on February 24, 2022, the rules-based international order was shaken to its very core.A sovereign nation was invadedwithout justification, sparking global outrage. This provided a wakeup call for the EU and clearly presented the need for a coherent and united front with like-minded actors to counter this security threat so close to the European borders. This article assesses how Japan fits into this equation and whether it has become a stronger partner for the EU in this context. Cooperation on a strategic level used to be limited, with the SPA-document counting 46 pages as opposed to the 562 pages of the EPA. However, in light of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, fertile ground has been found for a deepening of strategic ties.
Japan, being the world’sthird largest economy, traditionally enjoyed mainly economic and trade attention by the EU. This was also in line with the Union’s initial approach to foreign policy, which was solely focused on trade relations. In recent years, however, a ‘new’ EU foreign policyis moving beyond economic diplomacy, emphasizing instead multilateralism, norms and values. Europe started to identify itself as anormative powerand a “force for good.” This was largely in line with Japan’s new approach to foreign policy, centered around promoting values and norms such as human rights and freedoms. Thisrendered the EU an important diplomatic partnerfor the island nation and vice versa asJapan is a trusted partnerfor the EU in the Indo-Pacific.
A milestone that provided an official framework for political and security cooperation was theStrategic Partnership Agreement. The SPA constituted thefirst-ever bilateral frameworkagreement between the EU and Japan that promotes cooperation and joint actions across many areas of common interest, such as climate change, energy, digital, connectivity, research and innovation, space, security and defence and human rights. In the meantime, the EU published theEU Global Strategyin 2016, which outlined the ambitions for the future of EU external action. With the release of the Strategy, it became clear that there were significant similarities between Japan and the EU concerning international engagement, including the goal to reflect strategic priorities in development policy.
The increasingly strategic nature of the Japan-EU partnership is not unusual and it makes sense that the two actors would reach out to one another given their shared past of looking inwards. Both the EU and Japan are new strategic actors that excessively rely on their soft power influence and “share the challengeof raising their security and defense profiles.” Japan is still heavily reliant on the United States for matters of external security in light of Chinese, Russian and North Korean assertiveness. In addition, the island nation is legally not allowed to have an army, which is enshrined inArticle 9of its constitution, and adhered to a strictly pacifist stance. The country did bend the rules a little and established its Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in 1954, but this was purely for defensive purposes and the SDF are not in the possession of any offensive weaponry.
“Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”
The EU, on the other hand, only recently started developing — very limited — competences in the field of security and defense and is also still excessively reliant on the United States, under the umbrella of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), when it comes to defending the continent. Both actors also foster complex relations with Russia, a neighboring country for both Japan and the Union. These similarities set the scene for further strategic engagement and provided a geographically distant ally in a key region for both actors.
Against the backdrop of increasingly meaningful strategic relations over the past couple of years, the crisis that continues to unfold in Ukraine has proven to provide “yet anothercommon strategic focusand opens an array of concrete opportunities for cooperation.”
Japan is surrounded by three authoritarian powers and it is becoming increasingly clear that they are not afraid to lash out. There are even rumors based on an allegedly leaked email from the FSB (Russia’s secret service) thatRussia was planning to invade Japaninstead of Ukraine, in the context of the enduring tensions over theKuril island group. This renders connections with likeminded and normative partners, like Europe, ever more important for Japan and also explains why the country is increasingly establishingrelations with NATO. The island nation, represented by its Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi,was present for the first time at the NATO Summiton April 7, 2022. During the Summit,hestatedthat “[a]s we confront serious challenges to the international order, as symbolized by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific region cannot be discussed separately.” The fact that Japan also got invited to the subsequent June meeting showed that this was not just a one-time occurrence.
Conversely, the EU is experiencing the crumbling of the rules-based international order on its very doorstep, with the conflict in Ukraine likely to be a protracted one. Depending on the war’s outcome, Russia could decline in the coming years thereby permitting China to gain more and more ground in Europe and globally. This renders the EU’s Indo-Pacific Strategy all the more relevant. Specifically, Japan’s place within the EU’s extra-regional strategy is key as the island state is strategically located between China, Russia and North Korea. In line with this, Japan could provide a ‘gateway’ for the promotion and protection of democratic norms and values in the region. On March 21, 2022, while the war in Ukraine raged on, the EU published its first defense white paper, theStrategic Compass,  which seeks to enhance Europe’s assertiveness and military capabilities and — as one of the key pillars stipulates — aims to reinforce bi- and multilateral partnerships with, among others, Japan. This, in turn, provides room for stronger cooperation in the realms of cybersecurity, hybrid threats, defence technology innovation and maritime and space security.
“Japan is the EU’s closest strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific region and is a key ally for the implementation of the EU’s Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.”
Parallels can also be drawn when it comes to their reactions to the Russo-Ukraine war. Japan and the EU are traditionally slow in responding to conflicts given that they are still developing their geopolitical character. However, they reacted unprecedentedly quickly after the announcement of Russia’s invasion. Japan’s swift and outspoken reaction was especially surprising giving itspragmatic engagement policyvis-à-vis Russia, as established under Prime Minister Abe. This policy attempted to put an end to the territorial dispute regarding the South Kuril islands which also explains Tokyo’s relative inaction after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.
In light of the conflict in Ukraine, Japan decided to distance itself from this policy and explicitly condemned Russia’s actions.In a matter of days, it joined the United States, Canada and the EU in imposingfar-reaching sanctionson Russia. Between February and October 2022, Japan has madethirteen announcementsof additional sanctions on Russia. It froze theyenreserves of the Russian Central Bank, discontinued exports of more than thirty products —  including strategic goods like semiconductors and spare parts — and even withdrew the MFN (most favoured nation) status of Russia. Tokyo alsopublished a listof 622 Russian individuals, 53 entities and 11 Russian banks targeted by Japanese sanctions. Both the EU and Japan additionally decided to provide Ukraine with significant financial aid, humanitarian assistance and economic relief — resulting in €1.87 billion from the EU and US$500 million from Japan.
The EU’s extensive mobilization of military aid, specifically lethal weapons, to Ukraine through itsPeace Facilityproved that Brussels and its individual members can act beyond rhetoric, which resonated with Tokyo. For the first time in its modern history, Japan has committed itself to sending non-lethal military equipment to a country at war. Within a week sinceUkraine’s request for military equipment, Japan — in an unprecedented move — hadadapted its military exports guidelinesto circumvent the restrictive laws that would have thwarted its attempts to aid Ukraine. In early March, aBoeing KC-767tanker aircraft filled with 6900 helmets, 40 reconnaissance SUAVs (small unmanned aerial vehicles) and 1900 bulletproof veststo Ukraine. This signifies Japan’s normalization regarding foreign and security policy and could foster opportunities for increasing joint efforts with Europe, not just in Ukraine or the Pacific, but perhaps also in other areas of common geostrategic interest.
All these developments have shown that there is indeed fertile ground for deepening ties between Japan and the EU as they now possess increased capacities, tools and, above all, a willingness to address international conflicts and to protect the rules-based international order. Not only is Ukraine’s sovereignty at stake, but democratic governance and democracies worldwide are under pressure by the revisionist and expansionist tendencies of autocratic countries.
Russia’s war against Ukraine has become a symbol of a wider conflict, a global struggle between democracy and autocracy, between freedom and oppression.
Domestic polarization is further fuelled by foreign interference and disinformation campaigns. China is reported to have established more than one-hundred so-called “overseas police stations,” mainly in Europe, by abusing international and bilateral security arrangements. These establishments monitor and harass Chinese citizens who live in exile and reportedly try to influence and undermine local political developments. Recently, it also came to light thatQatar bribedseveral Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to influence decision-making, culminating in the arrest of multiple MEPs, including Vice-President Eva Kaili. Incidents like this reveal that authoritarian regimes try to erode democracies from within, making it more pertinent than ever that democracies across the globe present a united front against authoritarianism.
Japan and the EU could be frontrunners in this regard as they represent some of the strongest and most powerful democracies in the world with far-reaching economic leverage. Moreover, the EU is thelargest economy and trading blocin the world and Japan is the world’sthird-largest economyby nominal GDP. Now that their strategic profile is also rising, they will increasingly be considered major regional and global powers and can utilize this momentum to defend other democracies across the world. Perhaps the experience of the war in Ukraine can prepare the EU, and especially Japan, to act if an invasion against Taiwan occurs.
In the meantime, policy revisions should be undertaken in areas where capabilities are still underdeveloped, either through scaling-up capacities or by possibly expanding the EU-Japanese bloc to include other like-minded partners to fill strategic gaps. Regardless, the effects of the ongoing war are increasingly materializing and it is still unknown what the final state of play will be. In this context, it is important to remain cautious and to not disregard domestic needs. Otherwise, vulnerabilities will become visible and autocratic regimes have proven not to shy away from exploiting this, which will only further harm the state of democracy in the world.","February 07, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-return-of-hard-geopolitics-towards-a-new-era-of-eu-japan-strategic-cooperation/,Fiona De Cuyper,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
(Analysis) European Political Community: The French Approach Towards Greater Europe,"Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has fundamentally changed the geopolitical situation on the European continent. It has triggered discussions on the need to ensure consensus and coordinate joint actions between European countries. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted a radical change in the foreign policies of distinct European states and the EU. However, there are still issues that the EU cannot resolve alone because of the lack of unity inside the bloc. The war accelerated specific processes both inside the EU and outside its borders. Once again, the question of Europe’s strategic autonomy has become quite popular among researchers and politicians. There is hesitation whether the EU-27 is ready to welcome new members from the Western Balkans and the Eastern flank, for example. There have even been extensive discussions regarding the future of European integration and the essence of the EU. This is the context within which French President Emmanuel Macron proposed creating theEuropean Political Community.
The idea of a Greater Europe/European Confederation is not revolutionary in European politics. It can be traced to the views of French President Francois Mitterrand. The European Political Community reflects an initiative that was first proposed but never materialized. There were different contexts surrounding such an idea. The geographical coverage of this project was also different. Mitterrand proposed his project in 1989 when the Cold War ended, but Europe was still politically divided despite the fall of the Berlin Wall. There was a need to reunite Western Europe with Central and Eastern European states. Mitterrand, at that time, saw the importance of discussing critical issues of international affairs in a wide format. At the same time, his view of the European Communnities (EC) enlargement was quite pessimistic. He believed the EC should not accept new members from Central and Eastern Europe. In place of this, the EC should perform within the geographical boundaries of Western Europe, focusing on cohesiveness and economic growth. For this reason, Mitterrand proposed aEuropean Confederationproject that would embrace members from the Atlantic to the Urals.
The French vision of the EU’s enlargement policy has not changed significantly. France is still perceived as one of the key actors who are reluctant to welcome new members into the EU. Moreover, Macron often criticizes the EU’s enlargement policy. Under his presidency, the opening of accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia wasblocked. Considering rifts on various issues within the EU, it is reasonable to assume that it is still divided. It could be disagreements over sanctions, security and defence issues, or the vision of the European project. The divide between “New” and “Old” Europe is also visible.
The most common contextual similarity that one can apply to the EPC is the extreme level of uncertainty that politicians then and now are confronted with. Back then, it was unclear what would happen with the USSR, similar to with the difficulties to predict what will happen to Russia after its war inUkraine. Another parallel comes from the ambitions of Francois Mitterrand and Emmanuel Macron. Mitterrand wanted to amend the bipolarity of the international order and make France a major global power. Along the same line, Macron plans to make France the dominant actor in the EU and beyond. This is in addition to further enhancing its status as a respected global political and security power.
However, Mitterrand’s idea failed to come into practice due to various factors. One of them was the Central and Eastern European states’perceptionregarding Mitterrand’s project. Central and Eastern European nations saw the European Confederation as an ill-defined waiting area. Its only purpose, in their eyes, was to delay the integration of new members into the EC and NATO. These countries feared that it would only sow discord in the region instead of healing the rift in Europe. In the post-Cold War era, Mitterrand’s project sought to affect the interaction of European powers. In the same vein, Macron’s proposal is facing challenges, which may be explained by the EU’s “enlargement fatigue” and misunderstandings with acceding countries. Macron’s idea appears in a context similar to Mitterrand’s but in a geopolitical setting that is becoming increasingly troubling.
This new European organization would allow democratic European nations that subscribe to our shared core values to find a new space for political and security cooperation, cooperation in the energy sector, in transport, investments, infrastructures, the free movement of persons…
In May 2022 Emmanuel Macron outlined his vision of the proposed European Political Community framework. With the increasing security threats Europe is experiencing, Macron proposed this initiative as a solution to the present situation. With44 membersin the European Political Community, the platform can discuss a wide range of issues. The proposed institution brings together the EU-27, Balkan countries, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the Eastern Neighbors of the EU and Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The EPC includes other EU partners, such as those that belong to the EEA/EFTA. The President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council are also participants in this format.According to diplomatic sources, the suggested format is more likely to operate as G7 or G20. The EPC will create no institutional system to not duplicate the functions of other organizations such as the Council of Europe and OSCE.
Having so many participants makes one wonder whether such a format is feasible in terms of decision-making, because each country pursues its national interests. Often, consensus is not reachable within the EU, with only 27 members. It is also unclear how the participating countries intend to set up the agenda of their meetings in the EPC. Does any potential country have the ability to block certain issues and remove them from the agenda? Will the EPC publish any binding documents or recommendations as a result of its meetings? Overall, the EPC structure still needs to be clarified, which is the biggest constraint of this format.
Participants of the EPC gather around common security issues, however, they will try to promote their own agenda. Therefore, it is worth considering the positions and interests of individual states that are key participants in this initiative. France and Germany, as driving forces of the EU and other strategic partners of the bloc — the United Kingdom and Turkey — are interesting to observe.
For France, the EPC is an opportunity to increase its influence in Europe and beyond. Merkel’s retirement from German politics strengthened Macron’s leadership within the EU. It allows France to lead the EU toward French interests while improving its standing in international relations. Paris might try to push further the idea of strategic autonomy, which is not widely supported in the EU. France will likely attempt to frame the EPC agenda to suit its interests and those of the EU. This would encourage other states to actively participate in it, resulting in closer cooperation between the EU and non-EU members. France is also interested in reinforcing closer ties with the UK amid the Russian war on Ukraine. It is vital for Paris that the UK plays an active role in European affairs. It is problematic for London because of inflation growth and other domestic troubles that the UK is facing now.
The EPC is therefore a tool to prevent the UK’s isolation from regional politics. Having Greece and Turkey as members allows France to support Athens and seek agreements with Turkey, deterring Turkish aggressive behavior in the Mediterranean Sea. By inviting conflicting parties, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, France might seek to expand its influence in the Caucasus. This would replace the vanishing influence of Russia. This opportunity can be critical for France, given its diminished diplomatic efforts in the last decade. For example, failing to stop Russia’s aggression against Ukraine during the existence of the Minsk Agreements, to which France was a mediator. France’s stance on the EPC can be explained by the desire of Paris to boost its international status, which has been severely harmed by foreign policy mistakes and diplomatic mistakes committed in Europe and other regions.
Regarding Germany, it is critical to note that Russia’s war against Ukraine is evidence of the failure of GermanOstpolitik. Berlin considered Russia to be an indispensable part of the European security order. Germany thought it could avert all possible conflict situations by building economic and commercial ties with Moscow. Nevertheless, Germany’s bet on economic interconnections and interdependence was ill-advised. Consequently, the European Political Community could be a great opportunity for Berlin to rethink its strategic policies and make what Olaf Scholz called a “Zeitenwende” — a turning point in changing key strategic principles that had dominated German security and defense policy.
In this respect, Scholz and Macron would need to find common ground to formulate new guiding principles for their respective countries. This would critically influence the EU’s relations with Eastern European states and Russia. The contours of these policies are not yet clear. Both Germany and France need to reaffirm their reliability within the EU and outside its borders. As Paris and Berlin are required to consider the future of enlargement policy, their participation in the EPC will enable them to communicate the common agenda with acceding countries and candidates for EU membership. In other words, the EPC can serve as a platform for redrawing GermanOstpolitikand for confidence-building measures between the EU and its partners.
Concerning the United Kingdom’s interests, London is more or less satisfied with the proposed structure of the EPC as it lacks any institutions and a clear decision-making line. It seems to have a striking contrast with the EU that the UK no longer belongs to. With the EPC, the UK has a new opportunity to engage in European affairs and project its influence and vision. Against the backdrop of the worsening security landscape in Europe, the UK might use the EPC to exert pressure on European states to make them provide more security and defense-related aid to Ukraine. This idea could be explained by the fact that so far, the UK has provided more military equipment to Ukraine than other European powers. Strengthening cooperation in the energy and migration field could also be an area of mutual interest. After all, the EPC could ease the tense relations between the UK and the EU, caused bydisagreements between the UK and EU about Brexit conditions. In general, the EPC would allow countries to build bridges between them; however, the UK is likely to pursue its own vision of European affairs and is expected to be quite pragmatic. In particular, the UK government would like to show that its independent position is relevant to justify that Brexit was not a mistake. It also wants to demonstrate that Britain can conduct independent yet efficient foreign policy without being an EU member state.
Turkey’s presence in the European Political Community raises many questions concerning its domestic and foreign policy. Ankara’s participation in the initiative appears to be controversial. While the EPC advocates a common space for all who share democratic values, recent developments within Turkey have emphasized strengthening authoritarian practices and the struggle against the opposition. As a result, many question the country’s participation in the initiative. Moreover, in the last decade, Turkey has seen significant growth in its role as an international actor. Turkey’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy and pivot toward expanding Turkish geopolitical power accompany this growth. Despite this, the Turkish government welcomed the initiative, seeking to promote its interests regarding Greece, Cyprus, and Armenia-Azerbaijan tensions. Turkey is eager to increase its weight as a mediator in European affairs. Since Turkey seems to be less interested in EU integration under Erdogan, having another platform to shape European politics besides NATO is indeed in Ankara’s interests.
Despite its controversial nature, the EPC can in fact be beneficial and has the potential to be helpful in the long run. After the EPC summit, Oliver Várhelyi, the Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, made some remarks about the EPC. He raised the issue of the security order in Europe against the backdrop of Russia’s war against Ukraine,sayingthat: “for the foreseeable future, it is impossible to conceive a new security order or ‘peace architecture’ in Europe of which Russia would be an integral part. Russia remains a geographical neighbour and a member of the international system – but right now, we have to build a European security order without the Kremlin.”
Since the old international security structures failed to address the challenges posed by Russia, the European Political Community may prove an essential forum for debating the future of European security architecture. After the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine, a platform is needed to discuss the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries whose territories were occupied by Russia. Therefore, the EPC could play its role in maintaining dialogue between European states on the de-occupation of captured territories by Russia — Moldova’s Transnistria, Georgia’s Abkhazia and South Ossetia (Tskhinvali). Additionally, it could be helpful to discuss in the EPC what European countries can do to prevent future conflict by developing security guarantees for Ukraine. A consensus would have to exist within the European continent and with other non-European nations that respect the rules-based order to achieve this goal.
Provided the political will of the members of the European political community is present, the project can strengthen political integration on the European continent. This would enhance Europe’s position in the confrontation between the United States and China. Since the US and other allies are not involved, the French initiative may contribute to achieving some degree of strategic autonomy. However, even though European countries responded strongly to Russia’s aggression, the war proves that Europe is still dependent on the US to ensure security. Therefore, the desire to make Europe more independent in terms of foreign policy and security can be quite painful for the EU and the European continent. Moreover, this is not a matter of 5 or 10 years but a long-term initiative. Considering a number of European states’ misunderstandings, work on its implementation is unlikely to begin soon.
Given that sometimes French ideas are perceived witha certain level of suspicion and scepticismit would be a difficult aim to achieve. France would have to convince other European nations about the need to acquire strategic autonomy and convince the most prominent sceptic among European countries — Germany, who has different ideas about the EU’s partnerships with other leading powers. Hence, the French notion of the EPC is manageable in theory but difficult to implement in practice. France would have to manage and direct EPC development to achieve significant results. This would require France to define objectives in detail and develop the structure and bring together the interests of 44 members. Otherwise, the EPC will be a “talking shop,” as many analysts claim, without meaningful outcomes or convergence of interests. If the EPC follows this path, Macron’s hopes for France’s prestige and influence in Europe will crash. There will be no talks aboutl’autonomie stratégique, which France is so overwhelmed with.","February 02, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/analysis-european-political-community-the-french-approach-towards-greater-europe/,Vitalii Rishko,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"(Analysis) Greco-Turkish Conflict: Drivers, Feasibility, and Impact on EU security and NATO","In 1923,Article 12ofTreaty of Lausanneset the current territorial boundaries between Greece and Turkey, assigning sovereignty to the former “over the islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, other than the islands of Imbros, Tenedos and Rabbit Islands.” Following theTreaty of Parisin 1947, Italy ceded the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, allowing Athens to control most of the Aegean islands off the coast of Anatolia.
Although bothTreaties of Lausanne and Parisestablished the demilitarized status of the islands, Greece justifies its deployments of military contingents in light of what it perceives as athreatening expansionary readiness of Turkey. Athensclaimsthat its actions are also legally grounded in existing international law since the new legal framework introduced by the 1936Treaty of Montreuxgives Greece the right to militarize the northern islands of Limnos and Samothrace while theArticle 13Treaty of Lausannepermits the presence of Greek military forces in the remaining islands – provided that no naval bases or fortifications are built. Turkey also accuses Greece of violating the fundamental provisions in theTreaties of Lausanne and Paris.
The decades-long contraposition has been instrumental in heightening tensions between the two sides, a process that culminated in therecent remarksof Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about a possible sudden occupation of certain islands by Turkish forces. With such fervent discourse, is a Greek-Turkish conflict a concrete possibility? Moreover, what challenges may this conflict pose to European security and the functioning of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)?
Greco-Turkish territorial disputes over parts of the Aegean Sea can be narrowed down to two fundamental issues: the delimitation of territorial waters of Greek islands located close to Anatolian coasts; and the definition of respective continental shelves and the related rights to the exploitation of maritime resources, oil at the top. In the current arrangement, Greece established 6 nautical miles of territorial waters around its Aegean Islands, reserving a prerogative to extend up to 12 nautical miles as regulated by theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Turkey, on the other hand, which is not a signatory of UNCLOS, strongly opposes this potential expansion of territorial waters since it would significantly limit Turkish navigation rights to innocent passage in most of the Aegean Sea, thereby limiting Ankara’s military activities in the region.
As for the continental shelf issue, Athens argues that each of its islands has the right to a200 nautical milescontinental shelf in line with the basic provisions of the UNCLOS. In contrast, Turkeyclaimsthat some of these islands have no such right as they constitute a natural prolongation of the Anatolian peninsula and, thus, are located on what it considers its own continental shelf.
Although most Greek claims are grounded in the legal framework laid out by UNCLOS, it is worth mentioning howprevious jurisprudencestressed the need for a case-by-case analysis of how special circumstances affect the attribution of effects to maritime zones to achieve an equitable result for each state involved. Therefore, while Greece has arguably attained the legal jurisprudence for its territorial claims, it must be noted that the current arrangement, together with Greek expansionary claims, bear clear elements of inequity to the detriment of Turkey. Having said that, there is no reasonable justification for theTurkish questioning of Greek sovereigntyon certain islands, which clearly lacks any compelling legal basis.
Alongside territorial disputes, elements of domestic and international politics contribute to feeding into the Turkish-Greek contraposition. With general elections approaching in both countries, reviving historical tensions may prove a successful strategy for leading parties to galvanize their electorates and maximize domestic political support.
This is evident in the case of Mr. Erdogan who continues to struggle with a rather precarious domestic economic situation, the most emblematic trait of which is the24-year high inflationthat officially stands above 83%, but whose real figure is likely to be much higher. The Turkish public has also been increasingly vocal aboutanother element of dissatisfaction, namely the presence ofapproximately 4 million refugees and asylum seekersin Turkish territory. These are often blamed for the economic difficulties faced by the country and represent an element that bears large potential for social unrest. In this context, the risk of Erdoganbeing voted out in the next general electionin 2023 is now more possible than ever.
In the case of the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, tensions with Turkey may help draw the focus of domestic public opinion away from thorny ongoing scandals. Although his party, New Democracy,has been comfortably leading in the pollsfor almost one year, Prime Minister Mitsotakis is at the centre of ascandalregarding the use of spyware by the Greek secret service to monitor multiple politicians, businessmen, and journalists in opposition. Mr. Mitsotakis has denied having awareness of the activities of intelligence services. Nevertheless, this seems an unlikely possibility considering that one of his first acts as Prime Minister was to put themunder the direct control of his office.
If any responsibility is confirmed, the scandal has the potential to prove lethal for his leadership and, consequently, for the popularity of the party he is leading. Looking at the wider dimension of international politics, the recent direction of Turkish foreign policy has been another driver of tensions with the Western coalition, of which Greece is a part. For example, the relative distancing of Ankara from the U.S. in favour of a policy of balancing based onstrengthening the relationswith Russia has further deteriorated relationships with Western partners.
On the opposite side,Greece invested its energies in improving defence cooperation with the U.S. since 2017. As a result, the country has outmaneuvered Turkey as a key strategic hub for U.S. military activities in the region, adding another complex layer of tension in the Greco-Turkish relationship. Similarly, the exploitation of migrant flows as a bargaining chip, or even worse as a means of blackmail, by Turkey proved to be an unhealthy move for relations with the European Union and enhancedthe already solid European support to Greeceand condemnation of Turkish behaviour in the region.
Notwithstanding the low peaks in Greco-Turkish relations, and the increasingly aggressive narrative coming from Ankara, it seems unlikely that a real military confrontation over the Aegean Sea would occur anytime soon. However, such a risk cannot totally be ruled out. Let us not forget how Greece and Turkey already risked going to war due to previous maritime incidents to the point that, in the aftermath of rising tensions in the summer of 2020, someanalysts arguedthat a “military collision between the NATO allies Greece and Turkey is not a remote possibility”. Furthermore, with the possibility of accidental military clashes there may be room for the legitimization for further military actions from both sides.
It goes without saying that a military conflict in the Eastern Mediterranean would have widespread implications for regional security and would likely require some kind of direct involvement of the EU in support of Greece. Even if a material conflict does not occur, continuous deterioration of EU-Turkish relations may represent a substantial security liability for the bloc as Turkey holds a formidable lever in its hands, namely the release of considerable migrant flows as means of pressuring European borders.
This is a full-fledged unconventional security threat that brings together a variety of consequences, ranging from the potential infiltration of terrorism, the feeding of organized criminal activities to the increased economic, political, and social costs and their destabilizing effect on social stability in the EU.
One of the major concerns expressed by experts lies inthe negative impact this may exercise on the unity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), especially in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Considering thatNATO’s leading decision-making principle is consensusthere is no need to emphasise how a radically dissident member would pose a fundamental threat to the effectiveness of the organization. This happened with the recent Turkish opposition to Swedish and Finnish NATO applications – disrupting a historical moment for the Alliance.
Furthermore, having both Greece and Turkey as NATO members creates a paradox in the application of the collective defence principle enshrined in theArticle 5, thus challenging the mandate for collective security.
However, looking at the issue from theopposite perspective, NATO can also be interpreted as the most adequate political platform to handle Greco-Turkish tensions. The Alliance is acquainted with such kinds of rhetorical clashes since both countries joined in 1952. These became a matter of ordinary administration rather than posing a fundamental threat to NATO unity and effectiveness. Therefore, intra-alliance diplomacy constitutes one of the most viable negotiation frameworks for conflict management in the Eastern Mediterranean. Overall, this internal conflict surely poses challenges to the unity and effectiveness of NATO’s strategic decision-making. However, whileworking-level dynamics do not seem to be heavily impacted, NATO remains one of the leading forums for the management of the Greco-Turkish conflict.","January 09, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/greco-turkish-conflict-drivers-feasibility-and-impact-on-eu-security-and-nato/,Andrea Laroni,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Big Data: A Challenge for Democracy?,"In the digital age in which we live in, there is new information available every second. From credit card purchases to Google searches, everything leaves a mark. Big data is that large digital footprint that collects what we do both online and offline. What can all this information be used for?
Big data could have multiple uses. ForCukier and Mayer-Schönberger, it’s a tool that “increases society’s ability to take advantage of the information it generates obtaining useful insights, goods and services of significant value.” Yet, its purpose is distinctive:they predict – and on a large scale. The collection of data, combined with algorithms that search for common patterns or trends, is capable of creating profiles of individuals and predicting their future behaviours.
This forecasting feature attracts the attention of political campaigners. For instance, Barack Obama’sre-election campaignin 2012 pioneered the use of big data to win elections. Similarly, although on a larger scale, Donald Trump did it in 2016. In Argentina,Mauricio Macriused it in the campaign that led him to the presidency and it has been a staple for politicians across parties ever since.
The impact of this type of tech on electoral processes is revolutionary. It proves to be more effective than sample surveys and focus groups. It also creates great competitive advantages for those who use them. Nevertheless, its long-term impact can be negative for democratic institutions.
The key to understanding how the use of big data affects electoral campaigns is through the triangulation of three methodologies, known asDeep Learning.
For campaigns, two types of data are collected: demographic – gender, location, and age – and psychographic. The latter refers to behavioural patterns of individuals – assessing their openness, precautions and personal traits.By analyzing both sets, personality profiles are created. Once grouped, voters receive different ads.
It is no surprise that in the last decade, it has been a change in advertising techniques. Going from mass communication to personalized campaigns. In this context, big data makes it possible – thanks to the profiles created by algorithms – to reach each voter in the most advantageous way. Usually, everyone receives the same message but with variations in image, colours and wording.
Inevitably, this change in advertising influences the message. In addition to receiving personalized propaganda about the candidates, voters also get persuasive messages outside of the traditional form of election ads.
For example, during the 2016 US presidential election, to convince voters to support the Second Amendment,remaining a controversial issue in the country, republican candidates issued two messages. For voters who had a greater sensitivity or a negative view of carrying guns, they got suggested articles about how having a weapon was a form of protection against thieves. The image showed a thief trying to break into a home. On the hand, for those who support the Second Amendment, the message served as a reinforcement. The overall idea was to influence through emotion; either by the fear of being robbed or as part of a family tradition.
Another impact of big data is on efficiency. Specifically, deep learning techniques allow to plan strategies before the effective start of the campaign by having a better understanding of voters as well as what they want and expect from a candidate. It also speeds up logistics by enabling access to real-time information by geographical area, helping to recognize where it is more effective to hold campaign events. In short, the use of big data makes multiple aspects of the campaing empirically observable and predictable.
With the end of the Cold War, a new – individual – political subject replaced collective identifications. This individualization of the electorate deepened even more with the digital age. Since people feel less and less identified with traditional collectives, candidates must be more flexible. Therefore, it is possible to believe that the most successful candidates are those who are more permeable to change and adapt their discourse. Big data helps perfectly with this reality, but it may be creating – simultaneously – less critical and less informed voters.
On the one hand, by being continually exposed to information filtered by algorithms, personal views are not challenged, thereby making it more difficult to build critical thoughts. On the other hand, by constantly appealing to the emotions, political discourse avoids giving explanations. Therefore, the voter could end up becoming a passive recipient of an extremely tailored message.
Another impact of big data in democracies is the interference of external actors in national electoral processes. For instance, thepresumed Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, raised questions about the veracity of the electoral processes in which big data was used. The difference is subtle since it ended up being the electorate who cast the vote. Technically, there is no fraud. Knowing whether the voters made an informed decision or the information made a decision for them is very difficult to prove, almost impossible.

Global (In)Governance: The Yasuni ITT Failure,"Global governance is a relatively new concept that came about as an attempt to offer responses to new and emerging issues in international affairs that cannot be solved by unitary actors or by states alone. At its core, global governance encourages the inclusion and participation of non-state actors in coming up with solutions to global issues such as public health, crime, and cyber security, among many others.Climate changeand sustainable development are without any doubt issues that require a global governance approach, as, by their nature, these are matters for which one state’s actions could not be sufficient. The Yasuni-ITT initiative championed by the Ecuadorian government in 2007 was a failed attempt at implementing a global governance approach that aimed at promoting the idea that environmental protection is an internationally shared responsibility.
The Yasuni Park is one of the largest biodiverse zones on Earth, often referred to as a lung for the world. The park is home to the highest concentration of tree species on the planet, thehighest documentednumber of reptiles and amphibians, and numerous endangered species — particularly the white-bellied spider monkey and the giant otter. In addition, the park is also home to two Indigenous groups in voluntary isolation, the Tagaeri and Taromenane groups. All these particularities make this area of the planet worth preserving, which is why it was named a Biosphere Reserve By UNESCO in 1989. However, this mission is in direct conflict with the economic benefits that could come from exploiting the area. As a matter of fact, Yasuni, and particularly its Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) block, could produce more than90 millionbarrels of oil, creating billions in revenue for Ecuador, whose economy depends heavily on oil exports.
This dilemma is what birthed the idea of the Yasuni-ITT initiative. At its core, this initiative argued for the preservation of the ITT block to be a responsibility shared by all actors in the international system. Thus, in exchange for not exploiting the block, Ecuador was asking all members of the international community for economic compensation that would amount to half of the potential revenues to be acquired if the country were to exploit Yasuni. Thus, Ecuador sought to raise $350 million per year for ten years. These resources were to be administered through a UNDP fund and were supposed to be spent on social and economic development programs, with a special focus on transitioning Ecuador’s extraction-based economy into a sustainable one.
Although the idea had initially been conceived by grassroots organizations and scientists, the Ecuadorian government, and specifically former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, took it over and launched it as an official government plan in 2007. This program was perceived as an alternative to include some of the areas whose protection had not been considered in the Kyoto Protocol and it was coherent with Ecuador’s innovative decision to include nature as a subject of rights in its 2008 Constitution.
In practical terms, the Yasuni ITT initiative aimed at leaving oil underground, while compensating Ecuador for its economic loss. As the initiative took off, donors were encouraged to “buy a barrel-in-the-ground” and cover the costs of CO2 emissions to avoid them. Despite the innovative character of this project, the initiative failed as only $13 million was donated by international donors. Thus, in August 2013, President Correa announced the beginning of plans to exploit the ITT block. This failure is a reflection of multiple factors, among which is the poor application of the global governance approach.
While global governance sets an emphasis on inclusion and cooperation among actors beyond the state, this was not a reality for this initiative. Despite the initial idea being conceived by non-state actors, many scientists and civil society organizations lost their voice and their vote in the process right after the government took over the initiative. Consequently, the proposal lost a certain level of legitimacy in the eyes of potential donors that disagreed, in other areas, with the government. Furthermore, although state and non-state actors were thought of as potential donors and encouraged to participate, much of the campaigning for the initiative was focused on getting other states to donate, as a means of taking co-responsibility for the preservation of the environment.
Another big critique of the initiative falls on the somewhat incongruent approach taken by Correa’s government. As donations were being pursued as plan A, simultaneously, an extraction plan was being designed as plan B in case the donations did not reach the threshold. It is important to note that plan B was never a secret, nor was it conceived as a response to the lack of donations. On the contrary, plan B was publicly explained and explicitly communicatedat the same time as plan A. Thus, the mere existence of this backup alternative served as a deterrent for some donors as it could have been interpreted as a lack of commitment to the cause.
Global governance is an approach that can and should be applied to more and more issues every day as the problems in the world are, to a degree, no longer viable to be solved through unilateral state action. Climate change and environmental preservation could not be topics more appropriate for the global governance approach. Thus, the conservation of the ITT block in Yasuni Park was a missed opportunity for the application of an innovative approach to expanding the umbrella of intervention and interveners. Instead, it resulted in the decrease of the legitimacy of the Ecuadorian government, loss of biodiversity, and irreparable damage to a vital green-space of the world. Today, almost a decade after extraction plans were announced, Yasuni-ITT’s failure has taken its toll on environmental as well as social issues, such as the rights of the Tagaeri and Taromenane groups in voluntary isolation.

The Birth of the European Diplomatic Academy: Giant Leap or A Small Step Towards A United European Foreign Policy?,"In August 2022, the European External Action Service (EEAS) launched a project that has been long awaited by some and dismissed as a waste of resources by others. From September 2022 to May 2023, the European Union will run a pilot project for the establishment of a European Diplomatic Academy. An educational institution that could, in the future, become the cornerstone for the training of European diplomats and could contribute to a more coherent European voice in the world.
Funded by a budget of close to 1 million euros, the program will offer 42 young diplomats from EU member states, EU institutions, and some candidate countries, two semesters of rigorous academic experience with courses on “EU Common Foreign, Security, and Defence Policy,” “The EU, Europe and the neighbourhood” or the “Skill-set of a diplomat.” Classes will be taught by practitioners (80%) and scholars (20%). Carried out in residential format by the College of Europe in Natolin and Bruges, the syllabus also involves study visits to European institutions, team-building exercises, networking meetings with experienced diplomats, and training units provided by other security policy actors — such asNATO. Besides the academic program, the pilot project also encompasses a feasibility study, originally planned for the end of November, which will outline the options and budgetary scope for the creation of a fully-fledged and permanent European Diplomatic Academy.
The idea of a pan-European diplomatic training institution is by no means new. For decades, failed attempts have prevented any breakthrough within the European system and with member states. Several times, the European Parliament has called for the establishment of a College of European Diplomacy to provide international relations training to national diplomats and EEAS officials but the initiative remained largely unnoticed. In a similar vein, the non-paper presented byFranceandGermanyin 1999 during a Council working group meeting that brought up the idea of a European Diplomatic Academy, was dismissed. The idea was perceived as too far-reaching and was later replaced by the much less ambitious European Diplomatic Program. In the following years, the vision was picked up by the Working Group on External Action of the Convention on the Future of Europe in 2002 and by former MEP Méndez de Vigo in another paper.
Despite an emphasis on the Academy’spotential abilityto “build up personal relations between foreign policy actors, to enhance knowledge of the different national backgrounds and interests and to create a common European strategic and administrative culture,”  neither theConstitutional Treatyof 2004 nor theTreaty of Lisbonfrom 2009 included a paragraph on diplomatic training. More recently, the initiative gained new visibility  under the leadership of High Representative Josep Borrell, MEP Nacho Sánchez Amor, and Borrell’s predecessor, Federica Mogherini, in her position as the director of the College of Europe. Now more than ever the desire to create “a powerful instrument towards a commonEuropean (geo)political mindset” is strong.
But can a common training facility really remedy the EU’s difficulty to speak with one voice, especially when it comes to international negotiations and its perceived position in the international system? The hopes associated with the new institution are many. The recent years since the EEAS started operating in 2011 have shown that officials from other EU institutions working for the service are usually very familiar with the Union’s institutional structure, its foreign policy decision-making processes, and its diplomatic culture. National diplomats, however, although excellent in their domains and knowledgeable about the geopolitical requirements of contemporary international affairs, and well-trained in bilateral diplomacy, have been observed to have difficulties adapting to the complex European system. Without coming from an EU background, they frequently lack a particular understanding of how multilateral negotiations are conducted, how the European delegations coordinate with each other, and how budgetary procedures work.
Through the specialized training that involves case studies, simulation games, classroom discussions, and fire-side chats, participants will receive additional layers of knowledge that enables them to move confidently on the European political parquet. More importantly, the project of a European Diplomatic Academy presents a promising opportunity for young diplomats to network, build up their profile and move from the feeling of representing a single state to being able to act moreEuropean. The desiredesprit de corpsis supposed to create, what Federica Mogherini called, the critical mass that will eventually contribute to makingEuropean foreign policymore stable.
The program is therefore aimed at preparing participants for the assumption of leadership roles within the EU’s architecture and especially the European External Action Service. Being already familiar with European diplomatic everyday life, having learned from experienced practitioners, and built close ties with their colleagues, participants of the European Diplomatic Academy might be suitable candidates for transforming the patchworked foreign policy of the EU into a coherent voice that in the long run strengthens the Union’s strategic autonomy.
The project of a European Academy for the training of national diplomats and EU officials has not always been welcomed with open arms. One of the main concerns for skeptics is until today the potential risk of duplication with national services and the extra budget that a permanent educational institution would consume in the short and long run. Others fear that the unification of training methods and the strong European focus on learning experience would leave states less room for the realization of national interests and the development of their own foreign policy. However, will diplomats keep representing their home countries with the same zeal and loyalty when their socialization becomes more and more European? This question and the remaining points of criticism need to be integrated into the feasibility study and moved to the center of the upcoming debates about the permanent establishment of such a diplomatic institution.
It goes without saying that the EEAS and any future Diplomatic Academy require a lot of institutional work and adjustment over time. In order to give this development more structure, the project needs to be complemented first-and-foremost through an elaborate evaluation system that constantly monitors training needs and impact. This mechanism might also be useful to address the current tension between the goal to create anesprit de corpsthrough standardized group training and the necessity to take individual needs and potential future postings of different diplomats into account. Beyond this, the future Academy, which is currently very much focused on providing national diplomats with the necessary knowledge about European procedures, should ensure the installation of a genuine and reciprocal exchange between career starters seconded by the member states and European personnel. Lastly, some supporters of the Academy have called for the institution to be installed further away from the national capitals where participants could be distracted by their everyday commitments.
The pilot project is now being conducted in the Belgian city of Bruges, not more than one hour and a half away from Brussels, and in Natolin, a district of the Polish capital of Warsaw. These locations certainly offer advantages. But it would at least be worth considering whether the new institution or its campuses could be moved further east or to lesser-known cities for the purpose of diversification and decentralization.
The potential for a European Diplomatic Academy undoubtedly exists. All that is needed is for the institution to be utilized and transformed into a strong real-life asset for European foreign policy.
The unborn […] Academy is not a matter of bricks and mortar or a huge budget, but of political will and imagination in the first place.","March 28, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-birth-of-the-european-diplomatic-academy-giant-leap-or-a-small-step-towards-a-united-european-foreign-policy/,Flora Marlene Willimek,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Galicia! From Tobacco Smuggling to Europe’s Cocaine Getaway,"In 2021, Europol andnews outletsreported that Belgium (Antwerp) and the Netherlands (Rotterdam) had become the main hubs for cocaine trafficking in Europe, supplanting Spain as the main route of entry to the continent. From these port-cities, drugs are transported throughout Europe, a tendency that denotes the northward shift of the cocaine market in Europeexperts note. Moreover, they have also informed of anincreasing supply of cocaine, a consequence thatmanyhad attributed to the peace deal between theFuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Ejército del Pueblo(FARC) and the Colombian government and the subsequent emergence of groups that sought to fill the vacuum of power.
Indeed, the drug trafficking scene in Europe has undergone a plethora of changes in the last decade.Mexican groupshave established themselves in Europe  —and concretely, in Spain— to exploit the cultivation of marijuana, providing raw materials for CBD products. Cooperation between European and Latin American gangs has permitted cocaine processing totake root on European soil, with the continent potentially producinghigher qualitycocaine than Colombia. Drug traffickers have usedsubmarinesandunderwater dronesas new methods of smuggling drugs into Europe. Moreover, Europe’s artisanal methamphetamines kitchens have becomesuper-labs, a result, again, of transatlantic cooperation and the introduction of Mexican cooks into European drug kitchens.
This landscape, needless to say, has alerted authorities. In 2021, Europol informed that the threat of organized crime reachedunprecedented levels. The agency noted that close to 40% of European criminal gangs are engaged in drug trafficking. Regarding the future, it painted a rather bleak picture —the pandemic has likely fuelled gang activity on the continent for years to come, in large part due to an unprecedented influx of cocaine.
However, in this article, we are going to dive into Galicia’s long relationship with cocaine trafficking assome arguethat the Spanish autonomous community reflects the constant evolution of increasingly influential organized crime gangs that take advantage of globalization to better manage local markets. This infamous relationship, in fact, firstintroducedcocaine trafficking in Europe.
“It was always clear to me that my land, Galicia, had a calling — perhaps was even condemned — to be the natural platform for the European landing of Colombian cocaine and African hashish. The Galician rias constitute a truly suitable geography to accommodate the maritime routes, hiding places, and infrastructures that drug trafficking was looking to extend to Europe in a huge illegal market for his lucrative businesses.
Perfecto Conde, La conexión gallega: Del tabaco a la cocaína
Galician journalist and writer, Conde recounts the story of a Galicia that smuggled for decades tobacco, coffee, penicillin, and other products from Portugal to Spain. By the 1980s, however, the autonomous community moved from smuggling tobacco to smuggling cocaine. This shift took place at a time characterized by the saturation of the United States’ cocaine market,scholarsargue. This saturation, they note, pushed traffickers to explore the largely unexploited European market, which explains the increased volume of cocaine seized in the 1980s and 1990s in Europe. Galicia, thus, became the cradle and the main getaway for Colombian cocaine into Europe, establishingties between Galician smugglers and Colombian cartels. These cartels would exploit the advantages of the Galician landscape and these former tobacco smugglers networks’ —originally family clans— developed smuggling techniques and the sailing tradition of a centenary fishing community.
The golden years of Galician drug trafficking and powerful drug lords, however, lasted until 2003 when Spanish authoritieshunted downthe historic figures of the Galician drug trafficking scene —like Sito Miñanco or “La Padrina” (the Godmother) from the “Charlines” clan. As a result of these arrests, traffickingchangedand large clans with ostentatious bosses disappeared. For the next few years, it almost seemed that authorities had won the “war against drugs,” as the familiar sound of the speedboats delivering a shipment at night had virtuallydisappearedand drug boats were no longer seen being chased by the police or caught up in skirmishes between rival gangs.
Nevertheless, the war was far from being over. Like Hercules’ Lernaean Hydra, just when you cut a head, another grows in its place. Therefore, in the past two decades, we have seen an opposite dynamic of the European drug scene, that is, a shift of drug trafficking operations from the North (Galicia) to the South (Andalusia). In 2017,news outletsreported that Spain was losing the war against drugs in the South. Likewise, authorities expressed fears of southern organized crime groups evolving “Galicia-style” gangs and cartels. Miguel Gil, the operations chief at the Customs Surveillance Service,statedthat the Campo de Gibraltar “is undergoing the same evolution as the coast of Galicia in the 1980s and 1990s: from tobacco smuggling, they moved on to hashish, and now we shouldn’t rule out the presence of cocaine on the boats.”
The war had thus displaced to the southern coastal communities whereirregular migration, money laundering, tobacco smuggling, and arms and drug trafficking have carved a space for themselves. Consequently, Málaga has turned into the “narcos”logistic hubandAlgecirasinto a major entry point for South American cocaine. Meanwhile the apparent calmness of the Galician Sea was a chimera that hid the storm to come.
Galicia continues to be one of Spain’smajor drug strongholdswith most cocaine entering the region via speedboats. Galician traffickers had opted for small groups that are dedicated to offering only maritime transport services, leaving aside ownership and distribution of drugs. When interviewed, an anonymous drug trafficker revealed that few drugs came to Galicia via ship containers. “We continue to use speedboats,” —hestated— “we’re sea people. And the Colombians want us to do it this way. They send a fishing boat or a freight ship with the merchandise, we cross half the ocean on speedboats and bring the packages back to land.”
Nowadays, the notoriety of the traditional drug lords has beenreplacedby discretion, anonymity, and low profiles. Gone are the clans and charismatic bosses who controlled the drugs smuggled into Spain 40 years ago, as well as the pyramid schemes of past mafia groups. In their place, small and resilient groups that act as service companies, offering their maritime infrastructure and their knowledge of the environment for transporting goods, haveemerged.
Despite this presumed anonymity the author of Farinha, a book of the tale of cocaine in Galicia, pointed out that nowadays fourgangsgovern the Galician drug scene —the empirePatoco,Os Lulús,los Pasteleros(the bakers) andla banda de(the band of)‘O mulo‘. These drug lords decide how much cocaine enters Spain with their Colombian partners —illustrating that although the drugs belong to the Colombians, it is still Galician drug lords who introduce them to Spain. From Spain, the merchandise is handed to Dutch drug traffickers based in Andalusia. These individuals are considered to be the most dangerous and powerful bylocal authoritiesas they moved away from hashish and now discreetly focus on cocaine. The Dutch buyers then collaborate with Kosovar-Albanian gangs based in Valencia and Serbian mafias in Barcelona to distribute the cocaine across Europe.
Otheraccountsassert that Balkan groups and Eastern European mafias have filled the vacuum left by the local drug lords, some of whom are still in jail. According to Europol, these emerging mafias are the pinnacle of organized crime. They are multifaceted and, although they lack specialization in transporting drugs, they rely on Galician seamen to get their merchandise into Spain and have their own representatives in South America to negotiate the direct purchase of cocaine. In the face of these changes, Judge Juan Carlos Carballalhighlightedthat “we are looking at a new dimension of crime; in Galicia, nothing works as it used to.” What we have been observing for the past decades was not the end of drug trafficking, but simply a change of scenarios.
Slowly but surely, Galicia has partially restored its former years of glory. Old Galician lords havereturned, like Manuel from “Los Charlines,” and data from the Interior Ministry of Spain demonstrate how Galicia has become once again the main entry point for cocaine into Spain. At present, the number of drug hauls in Galicia has fallen compared with the past decade. However, the shipments currently intercepted arebiggerand the purity of the cocaine is higher due to a surplus of cocaine production in Colombia.

Did You Reach Your 2022 Goals?,"There had been several articles reporting Argentina’s political situation on this platform. During the year 2022, the “gaucho” political system suffered several challenges in a post-pandemic context where citizen discontent exploded. As usual, the emotional (and economic) feelings during 2022 were a rollercoaster which included a change in the economic policies of the Frente de Todos government, a murder attempt against the Vice President and political leader of the coalition, Cristina Kirchner, and the Qatar 2022 world championship in December. Everything in the context of the Presidential race in 2023.
During the first part of the year, economic unrest was the order of the day. Minister of Economy, Guzman, was constantly challenged by the Kirchner faction of the government. Although attacks againstGuzman began in 2021, on this occasion, the main attack was related to thedebate for the IMF debt restructuring, the Kirchner faction intended to disregard the debt mainly because of the terms of the agreement signed by Mauricio Macri’s government. The funds injected into the Argentinian economy were not in accordance with the country’s participation in the fund, the country received the amount of US$50 billion, the equivalent to 1,110 percent of Argentina’s quota in the IMF, thus violating the rules of the credit institution. Moreover, according toreports from the IMF,the Executive Board approved in June 2018 the largest stand-by arrangement in the Fund’s history, providing the country with US$57 billion (1,227 percent of Argentina’s IMF quota). These arguments in favor of not paying the external debt became radical after former IDB Director Mauricio Claver Caroneaffirmed that the payment had the aimof propping the Argentine economy before the 2019 election to favor President Macri’s reelection attempt.
Yet, the former disciple of Stiglitz Martin Guzman had other ideas in mind. Despite the political intention of the Trump administration of helping his ally in the 2019 elections, the Minister intended to stop the currency crisis and gain some credibility from foreign investors. The challenges against Guzman became so constant, that the Minister challenged Mrs. Kirchner by resigningvia Twitterduring a political rally where she was criticizing his policies.
After the resignation, the battle for succession between political factions began. The Kirchner branch of the government supported the right-wing Peronist leader Sergio Massa, a member of the decision-making table andone of the principal political shareholders of the coalition.
However, the President was firm in his intention of promoting his political allySilvina Batakis,the former Minister of Economy for the Buenos Aires Province. Her nomination was against the interest of big market players which caused anew currency crisisof Argentinian pesos moving towards U.S. dollars and further depreciating the national currency. Her experience in the Ministry of Economy was as brief as Liz Truss’s experience as Prime Minister.
After 24 days in office, Batakis was displaced from her position, and Sergio Massa became a“Super Minister”his new charge included leadership over the Agriculture Ministry, Production Ministry, and Economy. Hisfirst policies were toward a more market-friendly economy, by reducing the fiscal deficit and aligning with the IMF policies.  Despite those being the ideas that caused the exclusion of his predecessors, Massa had the consent of the vice president, thus becoming evident that the problem had nothing to do with ideology, but with politics.
On another matter, 2022 was one of the years in which political discontent reached the limit of violence. During the last days of August, Cristina Kirchner’s trial got her one step closer to a sentence confirming the corruption scandals during her administration.
Political violence had been scaling since the pandemic. In 2022 protests against the government got to the level of building aguillotinein front of the Presidential palace. In other protests,government dissidents attacked Mrs. Kirchner’s office with rocks. The climax of this climate of agitation came on September first, when the judiciary situation of the vice president got her closer to jail time,her supporters invaded the wealthy neighborhood of Recoleta(where Mrs. Kirchner actually lives) to “protect her” against any possible unfavorable court sentences. One night after her workday in the Senate, while the vice president was going inside her house and waving to her supporters, a gun appeared from the crowd aiming at her face,the man pulled the trigger, but the bullet didn’t come out of the gun.
The year 2022 was the year of political violence reappearing in Latin America. In Brazil, the 2022 campaign was tainted with violence.  The race includedseveral killingsof Lula Da Silva’s supporters,one of them with an axe. The brutality reached Lula himself when during a political rally, he and his supporters were attacked bya massive shooting.
In Colombia,Vice President Francia Marquez suffered a murder attemptwhen her security team deactivated an explosive that was positioned near her residence.
After a thrilling final with France, where Argentina won by penalties, an exhilarating joy filled the streets of the South American Nation. A sudden sense of lost pride appeared among citizens. The World Cup mobilized5 million peopleto celebrate the national team’s victory, self-pride and respect filled the Argentinians once again. Soccer gave people more joy than the political system has in recent years.
Nonetheless, even in the organization of the celebration, the internal conflicts within the Frente de Todos Coalition caused major inefficiency, making the celebration something exclusive of the players and the people. It was the largest massive concentration of people since the return of former President Juan Domingo Peron to Argentina in 1973. In this case, politics were completely sidelined from the festivities, revealing a sense of orphanhood of society from the political system.
The World Cup revealed a gap between the political establishment and the voters before the 2023 Presidential race. The Peronist coalition faces the symbolic defeat of being the representation of bad news for society against a group of athletes that won a competition and moved over 45 million souls. However, the government is not the only one at risk of the political divorce of society and citizenship. Former president Mauricio Macri faces afirm rejection of 68%among voters. Thus rupture is within the entire political system, fertile soil for populists and outsiders. The 2023 election will reveal the level of rejection and if the faith in the traditional party system can be restored. We live in hope.

Meetings Between Spain and Morocco: Reopening the Doors of Africa,"On Feb. 2, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez traveled to Rabat to meet his Moroccan counterpart, Aziz Akhannouch.
The relationship between Spain and Morocco has been tense in recent years: there are are topics on which the two Mediterranean countries don’t agree. The issues ofWestern Saharaand the status of the Spanish exclaves ofCeuta and Melillaare the most prominent: in the background, the Moroccan ambitions to manage the migration fluxes in and out of Africa. The three issues are intertwined and act as a political lever for one or the other country, in a game of counterweights that this time has favored Morocco.
Following the meeting, the two countries issued aJoint Declaration, in which both parties expressed their commitment to cementing excellent relations. The meeting between the two politicians bears the olive branch and aims to mark the end of the diplomatic disagreement that began two years ago. Indeed in April 2021, the Sánchez government had allowedBrahim Ghali, leader of the Front Polisario, to enter the country for medical reasons. The Front Polisario is a national liberation movement which for decades has been fighting for the independence of Western Sahara, a territory which is instead occupied and controlled by Morocco. In 2007,Morocco presented a planto the United Nations to resolve the long-running issue. The proposal was to create an autonomous government of the region for the Saharawi people: this would provide a facade of self-determination, while reinforcing the status quo by maintaining Morocco’s political and military control over the territory. Spain’s move had annoyed Morocco, which in response enforced border control.
Rabat, the gateway of Africa, refuses to recognize Spanish sovereignty over the exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, which it considers part of its territory. In retaliation for the Spanish maneuver, the Moroccan government haddecreased border control over Ceuta and Melilla, favoring an important migratory flow from Sub-Saharan Africa.
Using the migration issue as political leverage  proved to be a winning move: Sánchez retraced his steps andendorsed Morocco’s 2007plan on the Western Sahara issue. Now, this acknowledgment from the Spanish side constitutes an additional piece in the Mediterranean scenario which also plays in Morocco’s favor on the economic side.
The reconciliation between Morocco and Spain has indeed proved fruitful:about 20 economic agreementshave been established to support investment in the country. The economic and commercial relations between Morocco and Europe are a flagship for the African monarchy: Euro-Moroccan trade, already consolidated by the agreements of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, leaves the Mediterranean partner with considerable advantages. The EU is Morocco’s largest trade partner, accounting for 56 percent of its goods trade in 2019. 64 percent of Morocco’s exports went to the EU, and 51 percent of Morocco’s imports came from the EU.Morocco is the EU’s biggest trade partneramong the Southern Neighborhood countries, with 25 percent of total EU trade in goods with the region. Morocco also represents the main Spanish market in Africa, and the third outside the European Union.Trade between the two Kingdomsgrew by 30 percent in 2022. Morocco leverages its position as an exporting country: a large part of the exported resources, especially phosphate and fisheries, come from the occupied territories of Western Sahara. The economic agreements between the EU and Morocco are still solid, even after theCourt of Justice of the European Uniondeclared that they violated the rights of the people of Western Sahara.
Rabat, aware of its key role as a link between Europe and Africa, has played its cards and pulled the right strings in the geopolitical chaos of the western Mediterranean.
If the economic dossier is closely intertwined with the geopolitical issues of Western Sahara, the face of Morocco as gatekeeper of Africa assumes even greater relevance. The western Mediterranean route remains one of the most used despite migratory flows from Morocco to Spain having decreased by more than a third since last year’s rapprochement. Both countries have agreed to intensify their cooperation in the field of thefight against irregular migration, border control and the readmission of irregular migrants.
Migration policy can be seen as an innovative tool of Moroccan foreign policy, rather than a response to a public problem or internal concerns. Only Morocco has made an effort to implement significant immigration and asylum reform in the MENA region. As a country of emigration, transit, and destination, the kingdom has announced asignificant migration and asylum reform. The new law is to be part of the new strategy in order to better regulate asylum and lessen the issue of human trafficking. By changing its national migration policy, Morocco learns to talk of migration management, becoming  a fundamental actor and interlocutor in the international geopolitical chessboards. Morocco rewrites mobility partnerships with EU on its own terms, knowing that its strategic position is a fundamental leverage in the discussion around migration.
The dossier on migration is too strategic to be only defined by unilateral policy and could serveMorocco’s economic and geopolitical interests. Morocco is establishing itself as a counterterrorism ally on immigration issues for the European Union and important member states. Compliance with European demands, such as the border control on Sanchez’s agenda, may include obtaining funding and resources from the EU. As has been demonstrated, it may also entail acknowledging claims to the Western Sahara and economic concessions.
The first summit between Morocco and Spain in eight years is unquestionably encouraging, both for the benefits it can bring to Madrid and Rabat and for the overall direction of EU policy. In fact, the meeting takes place at a time when European nations are working to mend fences with allies in North Africa after the Russian invasion of Ukraine enhanced multifaceted dangers in the Mediterranean.","March 01, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/meetings-between-spain-and-morocco-reopening-the-doors-of-africa/,Beatrice Ala,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Stolen Cars For Export: The Curious Case of Criminal Trading of Canadian Vehicles to West Africa,"Criminal gangs operate like any legal company dedicated to the international trade of vehicles but with a considerable difference; the units they offer had been previously stolen. According to police data, in 2022,vehicle theftsurpassed break-and-enters and became the second most committed crime in Toronto, Canada.
Comparatively, and not ignoring the fact that mobility restrictions due to the pandemic may have impacted these numbers, 6,518 incidents of this nature were reported in 2021. The next year,the figure grew by 44.8%, with 9,439 reported vehicle thefts in the most populous city in Canada. On the other hand, in Quebec, insurance companies went from paying$111 million Canadian dollarsbecause of this crime in 2018 to $269 million in 2022. The numbers are eloquent and speak for themselves.
Nevertheless, the above only represents the first link in this transnational crime scheme. The mechanisms used to commit these illicit acts have been sophisticated and adapted to current times with today’s car hijacking occurring through remote door opening and closing systems that can bedisabled by signal inhibitors, as well as by the convenient, but not so secure,push-to-start ignition mechanismswhich are particularly vulnerable to theft.
The second stage involves vehicles being shipped abroad through international logistics freight services that cooperate with those criminal organizations and get profits for taking their part in the scheme. At this stage, not only are the abilities of the criminal organizations important, but also the ineffectiveness of public authorities to prevent the departure of hundreds of stolen vehicles through their ports.
This reality is astonishing since the vehicles are not shipped from hidden loading points. It cannot be ignored that exporting vehicles to a transoceanic destination is not the same as smuggling cigarettes or cell phones through poorly secured land border crossings.
The Port of Montreal is one of the places that became an inert witness to the continuous departure of these stolen motor vehicles that are transported within containers destined for African countries. As such, customs and border services of departing countries should redouble their efforts to interrupt this crime in its embryonic stages as the conditions in the destination countries are much more favourable for the criminal groups behind the business due to their ability to easily penetrate through state shields and bribe officials. In this context, it cannot be ignored that while Canada occupies the 14th place in theGlobal Corruption Perception Index, Ghana and Nigeria – two of the main destinations of illegal cars – rank 72 and 150 respectively.
A possible explanation for this phenomenon can be found in the attitude that customs authorities generally adopt by focusing more on imported goods than on those exported. The consequences of this type of vehicle trafficking are multi-sectoral. They affect the owners of the vehicles, the insurance companies that must respond to the insured, and the integrity of the states affected collaterally by corrupt practices and border and customs controls evasion. Furthermore, profits generated by the commercialization of these vehicles are often used to fund other illegal activities committed by the same organizations or their partners in crime, making this type of trafficking a prosperous funding source for further criminal ventures.
Consequently, the problem extends beyond the countries of origin, transit, and destination of the stolen goods, and takes on a global scope. For instance, the profits obtained from the sale of a car shipment in Ghana, may turn into financial aid to finance people trafficking from Vietnam to Thailand, or the trade of weapons from Russia to East Africa or the Middle East, as well as to terrorist acts in various parts of the world. That being said, there is no doubt that addressing this criminal phenomenon requires international cooperation and greater joint efforts from different actors – car producers, government agencies, and freight companies – who, by working together, can help to reduce vehicle theft and trafficking, protect citizens, and promote global security.
One such example are car manufacturers in that they can play a significant role in reducing vulnerabilities by improving vehicle security systems. Throughout investing in research and development, carmakers can develop more sophisticated unlocking technologies that make it more difficult to steal cars.
Local security agencies, such as police forces to customs services, must also do their part to better fight against vehicle theft and trafficking organizations by improving their intelligence and surveillance capabilities to identify high-risk areas, routes and ports. These agencies should also establish intelligence-sharing agreements with other agencies to track down stolen vehicles. In addition, stronger border and customs controls can help to prevent the cross-border movement of illegal cars, particularly in spotted regions.
Finally, international transportation companies should implement effective compliance and ethics policies for their operations, including regular audits of supply chains and enforcing strict security protocols to prevent the shipment of stolen cars through their services.

(Report) One Year Into the War: The EU’s Confusing Russia Policy,"With Russia’s on-going offensive in Ukraine having now reached a year and a half, the European Union (EU) has responded with unprecedented sanction packages against Russia and has displayed unwavering support for Ukraine (European Commission 2023, European Council 2023). The current geopolitical situation has overthrown the engagement between Russia and the EU and calls into question the potential of establishing any future relationship. However, the EU has no yet formally amended its Russia policy, which is officially still based on the “five guiding principles” first laid out in 2016 by the former High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini (European Parliament 2018). In addition, the European External Action Service (EEAS) cryptically mentions that “[i]n view of Russia’s war against Ukraine, all our relations and cooperation programmes with Russia are currently under review” (EEAS 2023).
The fact that the EU is so vocal in condemning Russia’s actions – with eleven sanctions packages announced to date, the European Parliament adopted a resolution declaring Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and European Council President Charles Michel vowed to hold Russia accountable for the destruction of the Ukrainian Nova Kakhova dam – raises questions regarding the bloc’s inability to formally amend the policy governing EU-Russia relations (European Commission 2023, European Parliament 2022, Michel 2023) . It is clear that the 2016 principles no longer reflect the current geopolitical reality and are in dire need of revision. Even in 2021 prior to the offensive, the EU was called on to amend its Russia policy (Paikin 2021).
However, in November 2022, a leak to the press made aware that the EU had started reviewing the principles governing its relations with Russia (Brzozowski 2022). Josep Borrell, the current High Representative, allegedly presented a new draft document regarding the EU’s engagement with Russia. This indicated a step in the right direction, but almost a year and many escalations later, the proposed principles remain undeveloped and the press have not reported on further discussions. This casts doubt on what the EU’s current policy towards Russia is and why it remains so ambiguous.
As such, this article seeks to explore the evolution of the EU’s Russia policy nineteen months into the so-called “special military operation”. To do this, it first provides some background on Mogherini’s five guiding principles adopted in 2016, followed by an analysis of the EU’s current behaviourvis-à-visRussia. Lastly, the article makes some reflections on the future of EU-Russia relations.
Until 2014, relations between the EU and Russia were relatively progressive, as demonstrated through discussions regarding the potential of visa-free travel and a free trade area (Gardner 2014, Vogel 2014). However, following the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine, the EU’s engagement with Russia took a first hit. This was reflected by a ping-pong game of sanctions, counter-sanctions and ensuing import substitutions (Bush 2015, Cambridge University Press n.d.). The 2015 Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy further alluded to the deteriorating relations between the two actors, but still referred to the helpfulness of “constructive cooperation” (European Commission 2015).
“The EU’s relations with the Russian Federation have deteriorated as a result of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol and the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. There are several issues pertaining to the region on which constructive cooperation would be helpful interms of addressing common challenges and exploring further opportunities, when conditions allow.”
In March 2016, the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council came forward with five guiding principles to act as a framework for the EU’s engagement with Russia, which, officially, still form the basis of EU-Russia relations to this day (European Council 2016, European Parliament 2018).
The first principle aims to enact a full implementation of the Minsk agreements, which were signed to achieve a ceasefire and “enable a political settlement” in eastern Ukraine (European Parliament 2018). This also entailed ruling out any recognition of the annexation of Crimea. The second principle concerns closer relations between the EU and the former Soviet republics. These include the six eastern neighborhood countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, which were integrated in the Eastern Partnership, and the central Asian republics Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
The third principle focused on improving the EU’s resilience to Russian threats, including in the cyber, hybrid and energy domains. The fourth principle envisioned selective engagement with Russia on foreign policy issues, focusing on the Middle East and the role of Russia in the United Nations Security Council. The fifth and final principle entailed supporting Russian civil society and promoting people-to-people contacts, focusing on education, scientific research and cross-border cooperation (European Parliament 2018).
These principles try to strike a balance between a tough stance regarding Russia’s actions and a certain degree of openness to engagement, effectively constituting the lowest common denominator between the Member States that are divided between safeguarding ties with Russia, such as Germany, France, Italy, Hungary and Austria, and those with a more hawkish position, such as Poland and the Baltic states (Meister 2022, Paikin 2021).
The precarious ties that remained between Russia and the EU in the wake of the annexation of Crimea fell apart after Russian troops entered Ukraine on the dawn of February 24th, 2022 (Hodge, Lister, Kottasová and Regan 2022). It also laid bare the many interdependences between major EU Member States and Russia, most notably in the energy domain. These interdependences, paired with the economic opportunism of the Union, contributed to Russia’s belief that ensuing sanctions would not be of a severe nature (Meister 2022). However, the EU has imposed unprecedented and far-reaching sanctions on Russia in the form of eleven separate sanction packages at the time of writing, thus proving that the EU cannot be overlooked in the context of the conflict.
In the past, relations between the EU and Russia were strongly rooted in energy interdependence, with Russia’s gas exports to the Union accounted for 45% of the EU’s total gas imports (Kardás 2023). In addition, Russia was one of the Union’s largest suppliers of crude oil, coal and petroleum products (Kardás 2023). However, the sanctions packages allowed the EU to increasingly decouple from Russian energy, imposing embargoes on the imports of Russian crude oil, coal and petroleum products (Serrano 2022).
By cutting off these Russian revenue streams, the Union hopes to undermine its abilities in sustaining the war in Ukraine. However, the EU imported significantly more Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) in 2022 and 2023, rendering the country the Union’s second biggest LNG supplier (Liboreiro 2023). In addition, the Union’s sustained and far-reaching support for Ukraine is also an indicator of its policy towards Russia. For the first time in history, the EU has leveraged the European Peace Facility to deliver arms to a third country, demonstrating that EU-Russia relations are no longer confined to the economic and energy spheres, with the bloc adopting an increasingly (geo)political and antagonizing character (Brzozowski 2022).
Whilst the EU has not formally updated its policy on Russia, a leak to the press in November 2022 revealed that amendments are in discussion regarding “lines to take” as opposed to a fully fledged policy proposal. The document outlined six points that would replace the five guiding principles in place since 2016 (Barigazzi 2022). One major point entails “isolating Russia internationally, imposing and implementing restrictive measures against Russia and preventing their circumvention, in order to prevent it from waging war”, thus reflecting the current reality of the Union’s sanctions packages and efforts to stop the war (Barigazzi 2022).
Another principle outlines “ensuring accountability by holding Russia, perpetrators, and accomplices responsible for violations of international law and war crimes committed in Ukraine” (Brzozowksi, 2022). Such a position is in line with the European Parliament’s resolution declaring Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.
Other principles include the need to “support civil society, human rights defenders and independent media inside and outside Russia, while addressing increased threats to security and public order in the EU”, hinting at the need to effectively address Russian disinformation campaigns inside the EU (Brzozowski 2022). Such misinformation aims to justify and distort information regarding the war (OECD 2022), with the campaigns going as far as to blame the EU for causing a global food crisis as a result of its sanctions (Liboreiro 2022).
Overall, the new envisioned principles that would underpin the EU’s future engagement with Russia better reflect the EU’s current position. The new principles are significantly tougher and more stringent in comparison to the previous principles, which were characterized by strategic ambiguity, and would limit room formanœuvreand interpretation. However, ten months later, there are no new policies and the press have not reported signs of further discussions.
One of the likely reasons why the EU has so far failed to produce an updated strategy on Russia is due to persistent divergences between the Member States. This is what initially caused the ambiguity of Mogherini’s five guiding principles, and provide potential insight into the protracted discussions on how to formally amend them to better reflect the current situation. The EU is only as strong as the sum of the Member States and will always be a “compromise machine” by nature (Fix 2023). The Member States must strike a careful balance between one side that holds an interest in potentially engaging with Russia in a post-war future, and the other with a more hawkish stance that believes the proposed revisions are not ambitious enough.
“But with the war still raging, not everyone agrees that now is the right moment to be settling questions about how to approach the EU’s long-term relationship with Moscow.”
As a majority of Member States are convinced that formal policy adaptations are premature, this also explains a lack of tangible progress in defining the new EU-Russia strategy (Brzozowski 2022). The war remains unpredictable and new challenges may arise in the near future, which should also be accounted for in the new principles. In addition, it stays unclear how Russia will emerge from the war and what kind of Russia the EU will face in the long term. Given the lengthy process of policy revisions, it would be undesirable for the EU to have a stringent policy position that is inapplicable and leaves no room formanœuvre. In this regard, the current principles are more flexible and do not impede a strong European response to the war.
In light of the atrocities taking place in Ukraine, it is clear that the EU ought to form a strong and united front to condemn Russia’s actions as they not only violate international law and human rights, but they also pose a real and imminent threat to the wider European security order. Nevertheless, in the long term, it is not desirable to cut all ties with Russia. The country is, and will always be, the EU’s largest neighbor and so ignoring Russia’s existence is not an option.
Moreover, Russia already perceives a form of geopolitical competition in the region which was an important factor in its decision to invade Ukraine (Meister 2022), and further polarization will only exacerbate this. In addition, when no form of engagement exists between the two actors, Russia will become increasingly unpredictable and will continue to develop deeper relations with other authoritarian countries such as China. Considering these elements, a number of additional challenges can be identified.
A lack of a clear EU-Russia strategy that provides room for engagement will also create effects on an intra-EU level, possibly resulting in further internal fragmentation. Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria have shown to be relatively pro-Russian in the context of the invasion (Muzikárová 2023), and according to a survey published in September 2022, the majority of Slovaks would be open to a Russian military victory of the war in Ukraine (Hudec 2022). Moreover, a Eurobarometer survey found that these three Member States are also the least supportive of EU sanctions against Russia (Eurobarometer 2022).
Bulgaria and Hungary are the only EU and NATO Member States to have openly refused to deliver weapons to Ukraine (Angelov and Wesolowky 2023), with Hungary also ramping up its anti-EU propaganda (Muzikárová 2023). However, Bulgaria did allegedly provide Ukraine with secret supplies of fuel and ammunition (Henley 2023). In order to maintain intra-EU unity and not undermine the EU’s decision-making, it is thus important that these Member States do not feel shunned. Otherwise, Russia will gain fertile ground to engage bilaterally with these countries and try to influence EU decision-making from within.
In the past, Russia has demonstrated its capabilities of meddling within EU politics by means of economic influence (Meister 2022). Corruption, money laundering and bribing were all part of the Kremlin’s toolbox to ensure a conducive economic and political environment (Reuters 2019). If the more pro-Russian member states feel that the bloc will disregard their interests, this could exacerbate Russia’s meddling practices and prove counter-productive for the EU.
“Russian elites were able to undermine institutions and stakeholders in Europe through corruption and money laundering. European banks and financial businesses played a crucial role in transferring corrupt money into the real economy and the real estate market. The energy sector was central in providing funds to bribe decision makers in member states and fund supporters of a Russia-friendly political and economic environment that would benefit the Putin system.”
Similar trends are also observable in the Western Balkan nations which are stranded in protracted accession negotiations with the EU. This has given Russia ample room to establish a fruitful presence in the region by continuing to leverage the “enlargement fatigue” and the historical ethnic and religious cleavages of the region (McBride 2022). By doing so, Russia effectively tries to undermine progress towards EU or NATO membership or other forms of integration with the West.
Meanwhile, in the wake of the war, the EU tried to revive its presence in the region and the enlargement process by granting Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status in December 2022 (EEAS 2022). But despite such efforts, Russia’s influence in the region remains significant. When it comes to Serbia, an EU candidate country, polls have shown that an overwhelming majority (95%) of Serbs still “consider Russia to be their true ally” (Stanicek and Caprile 2023). In addition, 68% of Serbs believe that NATO is responsible for the war in Ukraine and 82% are opposed to imposing sanctions on Russia. While Serbia, as an EU candidate country, is expected to follow the Union’s sanctions regimes (University College London 2022).
Such far-reaching support is something the EU ought to take into consideration, especially given the fact that Serbia is “the main source of Putin’s influence in the Balkans”, despite the country being gauged as the frontrunner to become an EU Member State by 2025 (University College London 2022). If Serbia were to become an EU Member State, it would give Russia a free pass to meddle in EU politics.
“Putin uses the Balkans, particularly Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a bargaining chip in his dealing with NATO and the EU. He has even sought to use the NATO intervention in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s to support his attack on Ukraine.”
In addition, if the EU is not on speaking terms with Russia, this will impact the new and potential candidate countries in Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia). In the past, Russia did not see the EU as a threat, as the bloc was conceptualised as a peace project (Debeuf 2022). As such, Russia did not see the EU’s expansion towards the East as a problem. NATO expansion towards the East, on the other hand, was what Russia wanted to avoid. However, as the EU is increasingly acting as a geopolitical actor, as demonstrated by sending arms to Ukraine, Russia could start perceiving the bloc as a security threat as well. In a scenario where Russia and the EU cut all ties, and there are no prospects of any form of future normalization, but the EU continues to expand to Russia’s neighboring countries and assumes an ever greater profile in terms of defence policy, tensions could escalate quickly.
Cutting all ties with Russia will also effectively close the door to any form of cooperation in the Arctic. Until recently, it was relatively unimportant whether the Arctic belonged to any of the eight countries surrounding it, namely Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, and the United States (Duurzame Student 2018).
However, climate change has exacerbated the melting of Arctic ice and is uncovering the region’s vast resources and possibilities in terms of oil, gas, critical minerals and even revolutionary shipping routes (Hadrovic 2022). This has resulted in a rapid militarization of the region, notably by Russia and the US (Hedlund 2023). Even non-Arctic states are increasingly interested in the region, with China declaring itself a “near-Arctic state” to justify its rising presence.
In addition, Russia has officially announced its ambitions to increase cooperation with BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation on Arctic affairs (Tass 2023). This is significantly undesirable for the EU since the Arctic region will continue to gain importance and Russia has already displayed its vast ambitions for the area, both in terms of security, energy and economic gains.
Russia is rapidly expanding its Arctic LNG production capacities, ramped up its use of the Northern Sea Route to ship oil and LNG to Asia and has planted a large Russian flag in the Arctic Ocean, signalling confrontation and dominance (Energy Intelligence 2023, Staalesen 2023, Vereykina 2023). Down the line, a lack of Arctic cooperation will also be detrimental to local Indigenous populations and any joint efforts towards environmental conservation and scientific exploration.
While the EU previously kept a low profile in terms of geopolitics, the war has turned the European Union into ade factogeopolitical actor, as evidenced by the bloc’s first arms deliveries to a third country (Brzozowski 2022, Meister 2022). To live up to this new reality and its ensuing expectations, it is imperative that the EU soon puts into place an updated version of its Russia strategy in which its engagement represents the current reality by strongly condemning Russia’s actions and calling for accountability. This will signify to Ukraine that the EU is determined to let justice prevail.
Yet, besides a clear commitment to protecting European norms and values, it should also account for future security challenges that might arise, notably in the Arctic or other neighboring countries, especially those with candidate status. In this regard, considering the EU’s military incapability, limited engagement and a certain degree of pragmatism is preferable over no relations, as that could only further jeopardize the European, and to an extent global, security order.
Besides, the Union’s policy will always reflect the least common denominator, and it is unlikely that more pro-Russian Member States will agree to a significantly more stringent policy considering the possible future Balkan Member States, while the more hawkish Member States will not agree to a policy that lacks ambition in their eyes, which could explain why the EU has not yet published an updated version of its Russia strategy. It thus remains to be seen how the war and its aftermath will develop and take shape, and what kind of Russia will emerge from the war to adequately estimate the EU’s official new Russia policy.

The Disillusion of the Silicon Shield Myth,"Since 2017, the strategic competition between the United States and China has intensified considerably, with a notable shift in focus. While the Trump administration prioritized trade matters, such as trade deficits and tariffs, the Biden administration’s primary strategy towards China centres on technology competition. Analysts in Washington and Beijing alike recognize that the party that achieves greater innovation in technology will significantly impact both nations’ economic foundation and strategic resource mobilization capability during the long-term competition. The US is endeavouring to secure an advanced position with China in the high-end semiconductor industry, including chip manufacturing and chip design software, and China is still suffering with how to get rid of the choke point on semiconductor manufacturing that is held by the US.
The emphasis on technology in this great power competition is primarily a result of the profound interdependence between the US and China in the industrial and technological supply chains, which makes it difficult to sever ties. If not for this extensive interdependence, it would be far easier for the US to achieve unilateral “decoupling.”
The tech war between the US and China on chip manufacturing, as well as the shortage of chips in 2022, showed the importance of the semiconductor industry. Taiwan has a leading edge in the foundry in terms of advanced manufacturing processes. The country’s companies account for more than50% of the world market. TSMC accounts for over90% of the world’s production of advanced process chips. For this reason, Taiwan has somehow become the centre of the US and China competition in this industry.
Today, global semiconductor production is heavily reliant on Taiwan. Recently, there has been aviewpointthat the semiconductor industry in Taiwan can help the country achieve international support if mainlandChina decides to attack it. The international community will not let mainland China to annex Taiwan so easily. Using Craig Addison’s words:“the semiconductor industry is a “silicon shield” for Taiwan. Therefore, the Taiwanese government should work hard to keep its advanced position in the supply chain”.
The US government is certainly aware of the importance of Taiwan in the semiconductor industry. However, the US will not increase its willingness to protect Taiwan just because the world is so dependent on Taiwan’s semiconductors. On the contrary, the US is trying to reduce this dependence and prevent Taiwan’s semiconductor industry from one day falling to mainland China.
On the one hand, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, a rare single-industry and heavily subsidised bill, to strengthen US domestic chip manufacturing on August 9th, 2022. The core purpose of the CHIPS Act is to strengthen US semiconductor production and manufacturing capabilities. At the bill’s signing ceremony, Biden said that while the US remains a leader in chip design and development, only 10% of the world’s semiconductors are produced in the US. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the US produced 12% of the world’s semiconductors in 2020, down 25% points from 30 years ago.
Ideally, the Act will provide funding for critical investment in research and development across the country. Fearing that the US is losing its technological edge to China, the Act includes $52.7 billion for the semiconductor industry, a 25% investment tax credit for US semiconductor and equipment manufacturing, and provisions for exclusionary policies for the Chinese chip industry. For $52.7 billion in subsidies, the biggest part -$50 billion- was allocated to the Chip America Fund to stimulate the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, the founder of TSMC, Morris Chang,commentedthat“all billions of subsidies being ring-fenced by the US for increased domestic semiconductor assembly will still fall far short of the necessary amount needed to boost homegrown chip manufacturers.”
On the other hand, the US is reducing its dependence on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. At theinsistenceof the US government, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) was asked to build a new 5nm plant in Arizona in the first phase. The 3nm process, which is currently the most advanced in Taiwan, will also be produced in the US in the second phase. All of TSMC’s most advanced processes will be relocated to the US. In an interview with The Brookings Institution,  Chang questioned the CHIPS Act and TSMC’s decision to set up factories in the US: “The US will increase onshore manufacturing of semiconductors somewhat, all that will be at a very high-costincrease, high unit costs, but non-competitive in the world market.”Not just high cost, TSMC’s investment in the US is also facing a shortage of talent.  Some TSMC engineerssaythat in Taiwan, employees work long hours and weekend shifts, joking that they are “selling their livers” to work for the chipmakers. They said that US engineers may be less willing to make such sacrifices.
Because of the shortage of engineers, TMSC had to move talent from Taiwan, creating an “exodus” as batches of talent went to the US. RadioFree Asia reportedthat TSMC chartered flights to send nearly 300 engineers to the US in early November 2022 and expects to continue sending more than 1000 TSMC engineers and their families to the US.
After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the international community pays more and more attention to Taiwan and fears that Beijing’s resolve to reunite Taiwan is not just propaganda. Considering the US technology blockade on China and Taiwan’s leading position in the semiconductor industry, many people are beginning toworrywhether Beijing will attack Taiwan to break the US’ isolation of China in chip manufacturing.
InBroken Nest: Deterring China from Invading Taiwan, McKinney and Harrissuggestthe Taiwanese government adopt a “scorched-earth” policy which includes the destruction of TSMC to deter the Chinese People’s Liberation Army from attacking Taiwan. They argue: “if the US cannot prevent China from seizing Taiwan by force, it should instead develop a strategy to convince China’s leaders an invasion would produce a peace more injurious than the status quo… Beijing must also be made to believe conquering Taiwan, while satisfying one core goal of the Chinese state, cannot be done without jeopardizing other core interests. In practice, this strategy means assuring China an invasion of Taiwan would produce a major economic crisis on the mainland, not the technological boom some have suggested would occur as a result of the PRC absorbing Taiwan’s robust tech industry.”

(Analysis) Bosnia and Herzegovina: How Far is Candidate Status from EU Membership?,"The geographical location and its historical interactions with powerful neighbours have contributed to shaping the complex ethnic and political reality of today’sBosnia and Herzegovina(BiH). The country has been historically populated by three major ethnic groups: Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats – generally associated with Islam, Orthodox Christianity, and Catholicism as the most widespread religious beliefs.
Following the end of World War II, the country became a constituent part of the Social Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), where from 1945 to 1991 its different ethnic groups coexisted in relative stability. With the collapse of the Yugoslavian state underway, BiH voted for its independence in 1992 in a referendum boycotted by the Serb component of the country. As a result, the Bosnian war (1992-1995) began, going down into history for the terrible ethnic cleansing perpetrated primarily by Serbs at the expense of Bosniaks and Croats.
With the signature of theDayton Peace Agreementin 1995, the Bosnian War ended and the country was given a new constitutional setup. The agreement built a balanced yet precarious framework for the equitable representation of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats in the country’s administrative and institutional system. The country was divided into two legally recognised entities. First, Republika Srpska which accounts for 49% of BiH’s territory and is predominantly populated by Serbs. Second, the Muslim and Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), corresponding to the remaining 51% of the territory. This territorial entity is further divided into ten cantons and is predominantly inhabited by Bosniaks.
The two territorial entities enjoy significant governing autonomy and jurisdiction on several subjects, from home affairs and education to labour. Moreover, they elect their own parliament and appoint their own prime minister and ministries. In the case of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, each canton has its own administrative government with jurisdiction over local policy areas.
On top of this highly-decentralised system lies astructure of state-level institutions. First, the tripartite Presidency is composed of one Bosniak, one Serb, and one Croat. Its members are directly elected and responsible for foreign, diplomatic, and military issues as well as the budget of state-level bodies. Second, the Parliament of BiH has 2 houses whose members are elected – directly in one case and indirectly by the entities’ parliaments in the other – in a proportion of two-thirds representative of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and one-third representative of Republika Srpska. Third, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of BiH is nominated by the tripartite Presidency, approved by the Parliament of BiH, and acts as the Prime Minister of the country.
Finally, at the very top of the system is theOffice of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, an internationally designated institution responsible for overseeing the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Among other objectives, this included pursuing post-war economic and infrastructure reconstruction, promoting free and fair elections within an established political and constitutional system, and ensuring human rights protection.Nonetheless, this is a rather controversial – and arguably undemocratic – institution as the High Representative is appointed by an external organisation (thePeace Implementation Council) and can leverage the powerful “Bonn powers” that allow for the implementation of binding decisions in case of a domestic political deadlock and the removal of official acting in violation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Alongside the institutional setup of the country, domestic politics are also shaped by ethnic divisions and characterised by radical political confrontation among theleading political parties. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, three parties dominate the political arena. The majoritarian Bosniak electorate splits into two political forces; the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), historically the leading Bosniak party founded in 1990; and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a left-leaning political formation, initially drawing from a multiethnic electoral base but increasingly associated with Bosniak nationalism and populism. On the other hand, Croats are historically represented by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH).
While the SDA and SDP compete over the Bosniak electorate and are ideologically heterogeneous, the HDZ BiH laments its base’s neglect within the political system and advocates for a constitutional revision aimed at promoting the interests of Croats. These ethnic and ideological divisions contribute to a polarised political environment and have practical consequences on the ability to form stable and effective governments at the entity level. For instance, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina witnessed a continuous political stalemate since 2018 and was forced to prolong the previous Prime Minister Fadil Novalić’s mandate in a caretaker capacity.
The elections held in late 2022 successfully renewed the tripartite Presidency and the government at the state level, however theprospects of breaking the political stalematein the federal entity are not as optimistic. Although it emerged as the largest party of its entity, the SDA lost to the SDP in appointing the Bosniak member of the tripartite Presidency at the state level and was excluded from talks between the HDZ BiH and the SDP for the formation of the entity-level government. Therefore, the party is expected to obstruct the attempts to build a governing coalition that does not include any of its representatives, with the risk of prolonging the political impasse indefinitely.
As for the predominantly Serb Republika Srpska, the situation is relatively simpler given the more homogeneous ethnic distribution and unified institutional system. The Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) is the dominant party and has been in power since 2006. Nonetheless, the party is characterised by a strong pan-Serbian, pro-Russia, and anti-European sentiment and threatened to secede from the state several times. Therefore, it is regarded as the potentially most disruptive force in the constitutional system of BiH.
Between 2018 and 2019, the formation of the state-level government was blocked by the opposing views of the leadership of the two entities over the future of the integration with NATO. Similarly, Republika Srpska recurrentlydisruptedlegislative and executive processes at the state level and – in 2021 – the entity’sParliament even votedto withdraw its representatives from state-level institutions. More recently, tensions with the Serb entity peaked following theapproval of a law on state propertyperceived as an attempt to transfer state property under the administration of Republika Srpska from the central state directly to the entity. Although this move was firmly opposed by the High Representative for BiH and the Bosnian Constitutional Court, its implementation remains an option on the table that would further fuel political tensions within the country.
From 1999, and officially with theZagreb summit in 2000, BiH committed to an integration programme known as theStabilisation and Association Process. With the ultimate objective being EU membership, Western Balkan countries initiated an approximation process aimed at the signature of tailoredStabilisation and Association Agreementswith the EU. These are bilateral agreements negotiated between the EU and individual Western Balkan countries aimed at supporting the implementation of necessary reforms to further progress on the path of accession to the Union.
In the case of BiH, this occurred in 2008 and paved the way for an increasingly closer relationship with the EU that included trade and VISA liberalisation measures and access to the financial resources mobilised by the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). Eventually, the country submitted its application to join the bloc in 2016. In the present context of arenewed European interestin enlargement and aiming to revitalise an overallstagnant integration processin the region, BiH was granted candidate status in December 2022.
In order to join the EU, third countries need to fulfil the so-calledCopenhagen criteria, namely the “stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; a functioning market economy and the ability to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU; the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including the capacity to effectively implement the rules, standards and policies that make up the body of EU law (the ‘acquis’), and adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.” Although BiH was granted candidate status, the country is still far from from meeting all of these conditions, as recently stated by the EU Chief Diplomat:
Candidate status is not the final destination, but rather the beginning of a new chapter. Serious acceleration of reforms is needed before the accession talks will begin. These reforms are not for the sake of “Brussels”, but for improving the daily life of all people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Every citizen has a role to play in this process, even if the ultimate responsibility to deliver lies with the elected officials.
The EU Commission had already identified several shortcomings in the 2019 “Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for membership of the European Union” – a document that outlines 14 key priorities for BiH to fulfil in order to be eligible for accession. The opinion covers three main pillars – political criteria, economic criteria, and adoption of EU legislation – and highlights the key challenges faced in each area.
The leading political concern remains the complexity of the ethnic-based political and institutional system of BiH. The high level of fragmentation in the decision-making and implementation of policies is neither supportive of the principle of legal certainty nor beneficial to the swift and effective adoption of the EUacquisat all levels of governance. The lack of a supreme court at the state level and fully-fledged judicial independence from political influence are other limits of the current system. Similarly, further efforts are necessary to build a genuinely professional and merit-based public administration free from political interference. Corruption is still endemic at all levels and calls for a more cohesive legal framework and effective cooperation among law enforcement agencies to be structurally addressed.
In economic terms, the existence of a functioning market economy and the ability of the country to cope with competitive and market pressures in the EU are still considered at an early stage by the Commission. Political confrontation and institutional fragmentation within the system negatively affect the ability of the country to implement effective economic governance and prevent any bold leaps towards greater reforms. The lack of a proper rule of law, the corrupted and cumbersome administrative system, and the presence of a fragmented internal market are other elements that shape an unsupportive economic environment for investors and businesses.
The third pillar focuses on BiH’s ability to assume the obligations of the membership and its progress in adopting the EUacquis(i.e., the group of rights and obligations that define the body of EU law) within national legislation. Once again, the assessment of the Commission is harsh since out of the 33 areas analysed, only two (i.e., free movement of capital and intellectual property law) displayed a moderate level of preparedness, whereas the other 31 exhibited either an early or some level of preparation. None of the areas presented a good or well-advanced level of preparedness.
The Commission keeps monitoring BiH’s progress in these three pillars through its Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG-NEAR), which is responsible for the publication each year of a report on the subject. According to2020,2021, and2022data, little to no progress has been made by the country in most of the clusters under analysis. The unsteady unfolding of legislative and executive activities due to political conflicts and institutional dysfunctionalities in BiH represented the greatest obstacle to any meaningful advancement on the integration path. The only exceptions have been regional cooperation – where the country displayed a consistent active engagement throughout the reporting period – and some progress in aligning national legislation to the EUacquison a few individual policy areas (e.g., competition policy and financial services in 2021).
In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the geopolitical confrontation with Russia over the Eastern neighbourhood, granting candidate status to BiH is a clear signal of a renewed political commitment to enlargement in the region by the EU. The decision also comes as a necessary revitalisation of the integration process in the Western Balkans after years of stasis and sterile negotiations. However, from a technical perspective, BiH is still quite far from being functionally capable of joining the bloc. The country needs to make substantial steps forward in implementing reforms relevant to the accession criteria – a prerequisite of which is stability, unity, and effectiveness in decision-making and policy implementation.
This cannot prescind from a de-escalation of tensions between the two constituent entities of the country and is eventually dependent on Republika Srpska’s will to put secessionist claims aside and engage more constructively with the other stakeholders of the system. On the other hand, the fragmented and complex institutional system of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is another weakness to address in order to ensure the effectiveness and political continuity of its institutions as well as the coordinated implementation of its policies. Currently, neither of these two major shifts seems poised to initiate anytime soon.

Security Watch: China Extends its Influence in the Solomon Islands,"Beijing’s increased security and political hold of the archipelago risks escalating geopolitical competition, which could ultimately undermine longstanding peace and stability in the Pacific.
The latest dynamic has seen theremovalof the Premier of Malaita, Daniel Suidani. A long-time critic, Mr. Suidani had used all his powers as a provincial leader to block Beijing’s strategic and economic ambitions on the island. Ten days later, his successor, Martin Fini, a former police officer and ally of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Mannaseh Sogavare,announcedthat he would allow Chinese investments across Malaita.
Following the no-confidence vote, Mr. Suidani’s adviser, Celsus Talifilu,accusedthe national government of the ouster. In recent years, disagreements between Honiara and Auki have crystallized around Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare’s recognition of the “one China” principleand thehistoric security agreementwith Beijing. Under this document, the Chinese government can deploy its armed police and military personnel to maintain social order, including Chinese assets. The former Malaita leader gained international notoriety when he launched acampaignagainst the national government’s security agreement andpublicly spokeout about the bribes, in the equivalent of about$40,000Beijing officials had tried to offer him – for the sake of propping up China’s interests.
The Sogavare government has been further incensed by the repeated actions of the former governor of the Solomon Islands’ most populous island to block Chinese investment projects. The Melanesian island nation is among the poorest islands in the Pacific. Nearly 13% of its inhabitants livebelow the poverty lineand only 70% have access to electricity. For Honiara, the rapprochement with Beijing is intended to advance and strengthen economic development to spur growth and economic opportunities throughout the archipelago.
But Malaitans have been particularly irked by the actions of the national government. Residents fear that the latest political move could undermine the Solomon Islands’ democratic system. Violent protests notably erupted in the capital, Honiara, in 2021 after Mr. Sogavare refused to meet with Malaita residents. When Mr. Suidani was removed from office, protestsspreadthroughout Auki, at times resulting in the firing of tear gas by local police.
The Solomon Islands are the only insular nation in the Pacific where China continues to have real and growing success. The Chinese authorities have suffered several political setbacks in recent months – in May 2022, China wanted to get the bulk of regional nations tosign a security and economic pact; in July 2022, China wanted Kiribati tobreak awayfrom the Pacific Islands Forum; Fiji’s new Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka is moving toleverage bilateral tieswith traditional partners Australia and New Zealand.
The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) ultimate endgame is to entangle the region’s low-income economies in an unsustainable economic relationship that will tie them to its political and strategic ambitions. One reason is to ensure that in the event of a war between Beijing and Taipei, Pacific capitals will at best align themselves with the CCP, or simply abstain, rather than align themselves with Washington.
As the Solamans have shown, China will remain determined to achieve its strategic objectives. The onus is on Western powers to deepen their political, security, and economic engagement in the region to avoid further strategic surprises.

(Analysis) Navigating the Complexities of Georgia’s Political Crisis: Domestic and Foreign Policy Dimensions,"Georgia’s political crisis has garnered the attention of politicians, diplomats, and foreign policy analysts. Many observers believe thatthe crisis began in October 2020, after parliamentary elections were marred by voter fraud and violations. However, this perspective oversimplifies the situation and proves that Georgia has yet to receive substantial focus from many observers in the West. The crisis has been building for some time, with numerous problems arising afterMikheil Saakashvili’s presidency (2004-2013). Some of these issues are rooted in Georgia’s political culture, including the political rivalry between former and current politicians, trials against former politicians, and the influence of oligarchs on politics. Generally, two parties dominate Georgian politics – the Georgian Dream, the current leading party, and the United National Movement (UNM), a pro-Western and opposition party.
The crisis has significant foreign policy implications, especially in the debates on Georgia’s position between the West and Moscow. These discussions highlight a particular aspect of the crisis: the mismatch between public demand and the actions taken by the Georgian government. It appears that the aftermath of the 2020 elections was merely a crystallization point for the pre-existing problems. Furthermore, it has become a regular practice of the government to use harsh rhetoric toward the West besides criticizing the opposition. Amid the backdrop of theRussian invasion of Ukraine, Georgian politicians have been blaming the West without substantial pretext.
The actions of Tbilisi’s leading politicians areinconsistent with the declared foreign policy course, particularly concerning Georgia’s pro-Western path. Since gaining independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,Georgia has sought to follow a Western trajectoryto implement vital reforms and move beyond its Soviet past. This has proven challenging due to pressure fromRussia, which still aims to preserve de facto control over former Soviet republics. One of the reasons why the Kremlin waged war against Georgia in 2008 was due to Georgia’s aspirations to join theEUandNATO. The fear of NATO’s eastward enlargement, Georgia’s partnership with the EU, and democracy approaching Russia’s border cause anxiety forPutin, as it threatens the regime’s security. Regarding exporting democratic values in the region, formerUS President George Bushrightly called Georgia“a beacon of liberty”.
Labeling Georgia in such a way reflectsits importance to the West. The country’s location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, with borders to Russia,Turkey,Armenia, andAzerbaijan, and access to the Black Sea, make it a strategically vital transit state with significant geopolitical weight. Moreover, Georgia’s contribution to international peacekeeping operations and its role in maintaining security in the South Caucasus region makes it a crucial partner in countering terrorism and stabilizing the area. Additionally, Georgia’s importance as an energy hub and transit partner for oil and gas, coupled with the potential for new infrastructural projects, adds to its strategic significance. Finally, Georgia is an essential country that acts as a bridgehead for spreading democracy in the region, making it a key player in advancing democratic values.
The US Department of State’sIntegrated Country Strategyof April 2022 recognizes Georgia’s critical role in theUnited States’ global network of alliances and partnerships based on internationally agreed rights and mutual values. Similarly, the EU has found Georgia to be a prominent partner, particularly after the signing of the EU-Georgia Association Agreement in 2014, which significantly boosted bilateral relations. It established a free trade area between the EU and Georgia and helped to reduce tariffs on a wide range of goods and services. The agreement also gave impetus to cooperation in energy, transport, justice, and security areas, and launched more opportunities for Georgian businesses.
To better understand the reasons behind Georgia’s political crisis and increasing anti-Western rhetoric, examining the role of oligarchy in Georgian political life is vital. Since the full-scale Russian invasion, Georgian politicians have often repeated that the West wants Georgia to engage in the war against Moscow. Another point they raise is that the West pushes Tbilisi to join international sanctions against Russia. Hence, they also use it to oppress pro-Western opposition forces and label them“supporters of war.”Moreover, they refuse to take responsibility for not receiving the EU candidate status andblame the EU for the pressureto be involved in the war. These false claims can easily be dismissed by the example ofMoldova, which did not follow the sanction regime but still obtained that status.
Consequently, anti-Western speeches and a mix of other factors contributed toGeorgia not being granted EU candidate status. Georgia did achieve crucial decisions such as the Association Agreement, Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, and visa-free regime, and implemented necessary regulations under Georgian Dream’s leadership. Nevertheless, these achievements were only possible due to the reforms initiated during Saakashvili’s presidency, even though it is being recognized that he indeed used someauthoritarian methodsto fight corruption. Thus, the new Georgian leadership was fortunate to have a strong starting position in relations with Brussels, with Georgia emerging as a European integration leader ahead ofUkraineandMoldova. However, since the current government came to power, progress has slowed, partially because of its perception that the EU accession will take at least 15 years and, therefore, there is no need to rush.
Many observers, includingmembers of the United National Movement, agree that the key decision-maker in Georgia is an oligarch and former Prime MinisterBidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili’s background sheds light on his preference for closer relations with Moscow – he earned most of his wealth in Russia when Putin was gaining control over Russian oligarchs. Surprisingly, Ivanishvili’s businesses did not face major difficulties during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some Russian oligarchs even described him as a manwho played by the Kremlin’s rules. It is difficult to claim that Ivanishvili is now free from Russian influence. Although he served as Prime Minister from 2012-2013, he is still maintaining power over the government through financial and political support for its politicians. Ivanishvili’ssubstantial control over political lifein Georgia is also evident as his party continues to consolidate power in various fields of the nation’s politics, including taking control of the security forces and judicial system and organizing a fight against NGOs, other political parties, and the media. Even though Ivanishvili declared that he stepped back from politics, various analysts agree that he now plays a“grey cardinal”role, influencing the decision-making process from the shadow. Georgian politicians admit the impact of Bidzina Ivanishvili and even Ivanishvili himself mentioned that he“consulted some of them”.
The rivalry between political groups in Georgia highlights theimportance for Georgian politicians of remaining in poweras a means of protection from being persecuted and facing charges. Although the transfer of power from Saakashvili to Ivanishvili was peaceful, the government has sinceprosecuted leading figures of Saakashvili’s party, including Saakashvili himself. He was perceived as a threat to the party and the Kremlin’s interests in Georgia. Various charges, including abuse of power, embezzlement, and exceeding official authority, have been brought against Mikheil Saakashvili and members of the UNM, with some cases being criticized as politically motivated by many opposition figures who feel targeted for their political beliefs. This is a significant concern for the West, as it could jeopardize the country’s previous achievements in democratic transformation. In addition to Saakashvili, other opposition members, including Nika Melia, Giorgi Ugulava, and Giorgi Rurua, have also faced charges.
The case of Saakashvili iscrucial for Georgia’s democratic future. Numerous human rights organizations claim the accusations andtrial to be politically motivated.Furthermore, there are reports that Saakashvili has been poisoned while in prison, with toxic agents such asmercury and arsenic. The Georgian government and Russia could be the potential beneficiaries of Saakashvili’s death, given thathe remains a crucial figure in UNMand has a say in the party. Moreover, the Kremlin would be satisfied by the death of one of the most pro-Western Georgian politicians, and someone who, after all, is the symbol of the Rose Revolution. Moscow has a history ofusing chemicals to destroy the opposition, so its involvement in Saakashvili’s case cannot be ruled out. Georgian authoritieshave not provided appropriate medical treatment to Saakashvili, which is arguably unseemly for a democratic country. The case of Mikheil Saakashvili has become a turning point for Georgia, which could either move towards authoritarianism or reaffirm its democratic path by releasing him and providing necessary medical treatment. In the case that Saakashvili is not provided with qualified medical aid and he dies in prison, it will be difficult to imagine how Georgia obtains EU candidate status under such circumstances.
The above-mentioned political developments significantly impactGeorgia’s foreign policy. The recent attempt by the government to pass a law on“foreign agents”has triggered a furious public reaction. The proposed law would require all NGOs, media, and individuals receiving foreign funds to register as “agents of foreign influence.” The public dissatisfaction was reflected in massive protests by Georgian opposition and the people, who saw the law asa replica of a similar Russian lawthat threatened democracy, fundamental freedoms, and Georgia’s official course to integrate into the EU. This has also led to disappointmentamong EUandUS officials. The US Embassy in Georgia called adopting the “foreign agents law” in the first reading a“dark day”for Georgian democracy. It stated that it does not correspond with the will of Georgian citizens. After an impressive public reaction, the Georgian parliamentunconditionally withdrew the approved law. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that they will not try to adopt a similar bill shortly, especially in case of increased pressure fromRussia.
Officially, the Georgian government has not announced any foreign policy shifts and continues to maintain a pro-Western position. However, Ivanishvili, who has been vocal about the problem of oligarchy, has signaled his readiness to build closer relations with Russia. There could be various explanations, such as Ivanishvili’s loyalty to the Kremlin, his fear of Russia due to the country’s occupation of 20% of Georgia’s internationally recognized territory, or a misperception of the West’s intentions towards Georgia. The lack of clarity in relations between Georgia, the EU, and the West has frustrated Georgian politicians. The current path of Georgian leadership threatens the previous achievements of Georgian reforms. Moreover, this puts Georgia in a problematic situation, as authoritarianism, corruption, and division within Georgia make it vulnerable to exploitation by the Kremlin.
Georgia’shighly polarized everyday politics, along with different interpretations of the country’s foreign policy and backsliding of democratic reforms, centralization of power in the hands of oligarchs, suppression of free media, political persecutions, and clashes between groups, are hindering the country’s foreign policy. Georgia’s anti-Western rhetoric, which is difficult to comprehend, makes relations between Georgia and the West quite toxic. There is an opinion thatthe government is trying to consolidate public supportdamaged by the absence of EU integration results and as Georgia was left behind Ukraine and Moldova. That is why the government wants to shift responsibility from itself by blaming the West and, namely, the EU. Another take on Georgian statements suggests that elites are too preoccupied with the domestic situation and political ratings to pay attention to their US and EU relations.
By following the path of balancing, the government is arguably making the country even more vulnerable to the Russian menace it is already exposed to. The dividing line between Georgian society and the government creates a dangerous situation, and Moscow might try to take advantage of it. Under certain circumstances, Georgia could be left face-to-face with Russia and cut off from its Western support. The gamble chosen by the Georgian government is risky, as it tests the resolve and patience of the West, mainly the EU. Nonetheless, not every politician in the West speaks about this issue explicitly. The government’s rhetoric regarding the West has become increasingly rough after the EU refused to grant candidate status to Tbilisi. It might complicate Georgia’s EU path and shape public opinion in the wrong direction. Some indicators already show that the level of support for EU accession has decreased over the last five months. As a result of the anti-Western propaganda,the number of those supporting the path to EU membership has dropped by 13%. However, it concerns only the Georgian Dream voters.
Nevertheless, most Georgians advocate for the country’s path to EU membership.The research of public perceptionsconducted by the Caucasus Research Resource Centers (CRRC) revealed that Georgians remain strongly pro-Western: 60% of respondents believe Georgia should continue its West-oriented foreign policy regardless of the threat of war with Russia; 73% acknowledge that Georgia’s membership in the EU will boost its economic development.
Georgia’s response to theRussian invasionalso exhibited anunexpected reaction from its elites. Instead of condemning the attack, the government has decided to boost trade relations with Russia and accuse the West of being responsible for the war. It could be the case that elites are afraid of losing the next parliamentary elections and are seeking to use short-term economic benefits and strengthen trade relations with Russia to please its voters. However, this approach is helping Russia to bypass Western sanctions and potentially exposing Georgia and its companies to the effects of US secondary sanctions. There is also a mistake on the collective West’s part in what we observe in Georgia – it has failed to offer a concrete path for Tbilisi to join the EU and NATO. Enlargement fatigue has created the impression within Georgian political circles that it is impossible to join these structures, leading to an attempt to imitate movement toward membership while simultaneously developing relations with Russia to avoid making the Kremlin nervous.
A shift in Georgia’s foreign policy towardsRussiais possible if the country experiences further democratic backsliding and authoritarianism or faces renewed Russian aggression or pressure. However, the likelihood of these scenarios is low due to the strong civil society that supports Georgia’s pro-Western path. Recent protests defending democratic values illustrate that any rapid shift toward Russia will face an immediate response from the people of Georgia. Additionally, the EU’s economic and trade relations with Georgia, and international pressure from the US and the EU, make a shift toward Russia less likely. The EU should develop a carrot-and-stick strategy while clarifying that Georgia’s future lies within the EU. This is necessary to counter groundless claims of the politicians of the Georgian Dream that tend to accuse the West of being blamed for all the domestic problems and foreign policy troubles. It is also vital for the West to facilitate people-to-people ties and strengthen relations between societies to counter Russian disinformation campaigns that shift public opinion.
Despite Russia’s declining influence in the region, the conflict between the West and Kremlin regarding Georgia’s foreign policy orientation is expected to escalate. Moscow might seek to gain advantages in countries like Georgia and Moldova to enhance its influence, given the significant setbacks it has faced in the war against Ukraine. Consequently, the West needs to anticipate such scenarios, as a shift towards Russia would have substantial geopolitical and strategic implications due to Georgia’s role in the Caucasus. The West, particularly the EU, should prioritize promoting democratic reforms in Georgia and encourage the will of its citizens to safeguard democratic governance and prevent the ruling party from further aligning with Russia.

"The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: From Japan-South Korea Rapprochement, AUKUS Nuclear Submarine Cooperation, to the US gaining military access to Philine Base: US Deployment in the Indo-Pacific","Since 2019,a three-year-long trade war between Japan and South Koreahas been sparked by South Korea’s demand for US $364 million in compensation for more than one million Korean workers after the country failed to reach a consensus on forced labour compensation by Japanese companies during World War II.Japan imposed export controls on South Koreanin July 2019 on three key raw materials needed to produce semiconductors: hydrogen fluoride, photoresist, and fluorinated polyamide. Each export contract was subject to individual scrutiny, which significantly delayed exports. The then President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, protested strongly and later advocated “getting rid of Japan” against the unreasonable control of the other side, and promoted thenationalisation of semiconductor-related materials and manufacturing equipment. During this period, Korea accelerated local production of semiconductor-related components to replace some items or was forced to purchase substitutes, while Japanese companies also faced reduced sales.
The Western Pacific has been the scene of many diplomatic events over the past period of time. Since his inauguration, the incumbent President of South Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol, has made concerted efforts to improve bilateral ties with Tokyo, underscoring the need for Korea to surmount its historical disagreements with Japan. In June 2022, President Yoon wasinvitedto attend the NATO Summit in Spain, marking the first instance of a Korean leader participating in the event. Significantly, the gathering also facilitated a reunion among the leaders of Korea, the US, and Japan after a four-year and nine-month hiatus. Additionally, in November of the same year, the Korean Navy took part in Japan’s International Maritime Parade, marking its first participation since 2015.
On the occasion of the 104th anniversary of the “March 1st Movement” Day ceremony in 2023, President Yoon delivered a speech emphasising the importance of cooperation among South Korea, the US, and Japan. According to the Korean News Agency, President Yoon highlighted that over a century has passed since the movement took place, and Japan has transformed from a militaristic aggressor to a partner that shares universal values with Korea and collaborates on economic security and global issues. He stressed that, given the complex global crisis and the grave security threat posed by North Korean nuclear activities, cooperation among the three nations is more critical than ever. To achieve this objective, the Korean government announced a significant measure to improve relations between the two countries: it willno longer requestJapanese companies to compensate Korean victims of forced labour during World War II, instead creating a fund to pay the victims directly. On April 27, President Yoon visited the US. In aspeechto a joint session of the US House and Senate during the visit, he made it clear that South Korea will work with the US to uphold and promote freedom values, stressing that the US-South Korean alliance should be “upgraded” on all fronts. At the end of the visit, the US and South Korea jointly issued theWashington Declaration. The declaration included a reaffirmation that if North Korea attacked South Korea, the US would cooperate with South Korea in the war and would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons. This declaration is the first time the US has documented its nuclear umbrella over South Korea. Strategically, President Yoon’s initiative to reconcile with Japan and the Washington Declaration may aid the United States in strengthening its geopolitical influence in Northeast Asia to counterbalance China.
On the other side of the Pacific, US President Joe Biden held a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese after a meeting at the San Diego Naval Base in California on March 13th. At the joint press conference, they unveiled details of the programme to supply Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines. This major initiative involves hundreds of billions of dollars of investment tocounter China’s ambitionsin the Indo-Pacific region. This joint US-UK initiative to help Australia developnuclear-powered submarines, replacing the nearly ten times cheaper diesel-powered submarine programme between Australia and France, will, if successful, significantly increase the distance and deployment time of Australian submarines in the Indian Ocean, South Pacific, and South China Sea and may eventually impede the PLA’s move to unify Taiwan across the strait.
If we now turn our attention to Southeast Asia, the US military partnership with the Philippines has also increased significantly. When former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was in office, the Philippines and China had good relationshiped significantly. Current President Marcos, who took office in June last year, has aligned himself with the US, saying that he would never allow Beijing to infringe on the Philippines’ maritime sovereignty. In February this year, the US and the Philippines agreed to expand their strategic cooperation (EDCA) by increasingthe number of US basesto nine, but the locations of the four additional bases were not disclosed during government consultations with local officials. On April 3rd, Manila announced the exact locations of four military bases for the US military to be stationed in the Philippines. AFP reported that two of them are located close to Taiwan, namely an air force base on Balabac Island off the southern tip of Balawan Island, near the South China Sea, and a naval base in Cagayan province, only about 400 kilometres from Taiwan. The Philippines is geographically close to Taiwan and surrounded by sea, so the US sees it as having an important role in the Taiwan Strait conflict and keeping China in check.
With US military deployments in Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia and growing alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, an Asian version of NATO is taking shape in the Indo-Pacific.

Yet Another Attempt at Peace: New Round of Negotiations between the Colombian Government & the ELN,"Intractable conflicts are those considered to have no resolution. The armed conflict in Colombia has often been categorized as such. However, in 2016, then-President Juan Manuel Santos reached his predecessors’ goal; he signed a peace treaty with the largest guerrilla group in the country, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). Without any doubt, the peace agreement is far from perfect but that is the subject of a different discussion.Issues regarding the transparency of its application and its compliance with international law and cultural norms have been the source of some disagreement.
While the FARC was the most active guerrilla group in terms of its quantity of members and attacks, it is not the only one present in Colombia. On the contrary, the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) is the oldest guerrilla group. Despite decades of attempts, the Colombian government has not been able to reach a peace agreement with this group. Earlier this year, the government and the ELN resumed negotiations once again. Everybody remains attentive to see whether this time would be the charm.
The oldest active guerilla group in the continent was founded in 1964 and describes itself as a supporter of the Cuban Revolution and adherent to Marxist and Leninist doctrines. The ELN had apolitical and social origin, following a leftist ideology and aiming to become the voice of those affected by neoliberalism. The group claims to pursue the attainment of social needs, especially regarding wealth redistribution and public services. In practice, the means to this goal have been violence. The political motivations behind this guerilla group are what has often caused the failure in past peace negotiations. While the ELN has also engaged in multiple violent incidents throughout its existence, the group maintains that its leftist political ideology makes it different from other violent groups such as the FARC, as their goal is not accumulating wealth or expanding drug markets. Rather, they see their struggle as one for social justice and equality. Thus, any perceptions of the FARC and ELN having the same nature, and receiving the same treatment are inappropriate.
The ELN’s history has been plagued with bombings, kidnapping for ransoms, and paramilitary activity in various areas of the country. In 1999,the organization kidnapped over 100 peopleat a church in Cali, Colombia, and a commercial flight with more than 40 people on it. In addition to kidnapping, the group has participated in the extortion of businesses and drug trafficking as sources of funding for their activities. Currently, the exact number of ELN militants is unknown but is suspected to bearound 3000 individualswith a presence in Colombia and Venezuela.
As extensive as the Colombian armed conflict has been, so have the attempts at peace. Indeed, the first negotiations with the ELN date back to 1975 and have been a constant campaign offering of many presidents. The most recent effort started in 2014 under President Santos and was formalized in 2016 as negotiations with the FARC were taking place. These negotiations seemed to be progressing and continued during Ivan Duque’s presidency, which implemented some of ELN’s requirements regarding social assistance. However, further negotiations were canceled in 2019 by President Duque after theguerrilla group bombeda police academy killing more than 20 people. After the attack, Duque’s government closed the door to further negotiation.
The Colombian government and the ELN are sitting around the negotiating table once again, this time in Venezuela and under the presidency of Gustavo Petro. There are two factors that seem to differentiate this round of negotiations and bring hope into achieving the long-awaited peace. First, Petro’s character. Second, a state of ripeness of the conflict.
Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s new president follows a leftist ideology and was himself part of a guerrilla organization, M-19, known for stealing Simon Bolivar’s sword from a monument in Bogota. Although M-19 and the ELN are completely different organizations and have behaved differently in terms of their links tocriminal activityand violence, Petro’s membership in a guerrilla group makes him closer in identity to ELN militants than any other president.
As soon as he initiated his mandate, Petrolifted the arrest warrants and extradition requestsestablished by the previous government against certain ELN members. By October 2022, only two months after the start of his presidential mandate, the Colombian government had begun negotiations with the ELN. The first formal round of negotiations took place between November 21 and December 12, 2022, in Caracas. However, not everything has gone perfectly. At the end of 2022, Petro shared an end-of-year tweet that could have catastrophically damaged the peace process. On the evening of December 31, the president announced through his social media account that the government had reached a six-month-longbilateral cease-fire agreementwith the ELN and four other armed groups. However, three days later, the ELN publicly denied the government’s statement, clarifying a cease-fire had not yet been discussed nor agreed. The Colombian government responded by saying the cease-fire proposal is just that and will be brought into discussion in the next round of negotiations.
Without any doubt, this mistake on the government’s side could have provoked feelings of distrust, suspicion, and disappointment on the ELN’s side. However, the guerrilla group is still participating in the process after a short pause. Negotiations resumed at the beginning of March and have established a new agenda with six items called theAgreement of Mexico. This document was signed on March 10, 2023, by the representatives of the government and the ELN in the negotiations. Theagenda itemsare public participation in the peacebuilding process, democracy for peace, transformation for peace, victims, end to the armed conflict, and a general plan for the execution of agreements between the Colombian government and the ELN.
There is no doubt that President Petro’s tweet could have paused indefinitely or even put an end to the peace process at hand. Nonetheless, the fact that the ELN is still actively participating and negotiating could be a sign of this conflict’s ripeness. William Zartman, International Studies professor at Johns Hopkins University, defines this moment in conflicts as one in which enough suffering has taken place, and parties have reached a mutually hurting stalemate. Thus, there is no other option than seeking a resolution, as continuing the conflict is more damaging to each party’s interests which have already reached their threshold for suffering and loss.
The willingness shown and steps taken by both sides in this conflict, in addition to Petro’s past and particular approach to the issue, seem to be shedding some light of hope for peace. However, just as a conflict, negotiations, and peace processes are volatile. Whether an agreement is reached this time will only depend on the parties’ continuous commitment to the process.

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: From the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran to Xi’s Visit to Russia – The Strategic Game Between China and the US Behind the Scenes,"On 10th March 2023, Iran and Saudi Arabia announced in Beijing the resumption of diplomatic relations, ending a seven-year break in relations between the two countries. Diplomatic resumption has aroused global attention. For one thing, Iran and Saudi Arabia have been at loggerheads for many years, accusing each other of interfering in their internal affairs and staging high-intensityproxy conflictsin the war zones of Syria and Yemen. Second, China and the Middle East have never been actively involved in political affairs but have instead focused on economic and infrastructural cooperation. This time China was able to mediate the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two powers in the region and it was indeed a shock to many political experts. Even though theUS responseon March 10th, for example, showed that Washington had failed to grasp this development, and even though it may have known about the meeting between Saudi and Iranian officials in China, it certainly did not expect that the two countries would be able to resume diplomatic relations. On the first anniversary of the Ukraine war, the Chinese government publishedThe Global Security Initiative Concept Paper. Article 4 states that “Humanity is an indivisible security community. Security of one country should not come at the expense of that of others.” Other than realists’ balancing and bandwagoning strategy, China’s global security initiative aims to jump out from the mentality of the Cold War or bloc confrontation and support mankind as a “Community of Common Destiny.” China’s role in the resumption of Saudi-Iranian diplomatic relations can be seen as an implementation of this concept. The security of Iran and Saudi Arabia should not come at the expense of each other.
For Beijing, there have been concrete achievements, but there are still many challenges to such an accomplishment. The biggest one is Iran’s bona fides of “good neighbour policy” remain to be tested over time. As Daniel B. Shapiropointed out: although Iran has oscillated between escalating and de-escalating tensions with neighbouring countries, there is no evidence of a shift in Iran’s strategic objectives. These goals comprise regional hegemony supported by an expanding nuclear program, the widespread propagation of influence through terrorist proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, and overt animosity toward Isreal. As part of the Iranian-Saudi Arabian deal, Iran hasagreedto halt covert weapons shipments to its Houthi allies in Yemen. Therefore, whether the Yemeni civil war will be stopped can be viewed as a touchstone for the outcome of the China-brokered deal. Second, China’s influence in the Middle East is growing with the development of shale oil in the US and the emergence of China asthe largest oil importerin the Middle East. However, China’s role in the Iranian-Saudi Arabian rapprochement should not be overestimated because all Beijing has done was to finalise a deal that has been in the making, mediating by multiple Middle East countries, for at least two years. Third, China has always been strong in the Middle East in terms of economic power but not as strong as the US in terms of military deployment and intervention. As Al Jazeeraanalyzed: It is unlikely that China will intervene directly in Middle East security issues or intervene militarily in the near future, but will focus on its economic plans under the Belt and Road Initiative. Because of this reason, it cannot be ruled out that the hardliners of the two countries who disagree with the diplomatic rapprochement will nevertheless clash within their borders or in proxy countries and Chinese influence may not be powerful enough to maintain order. The US and Isreal’s attitudes and reactions, diplomatically and militarily, to the rapprochement are also still remaining to be seen. Today, the US still operates at least 30 military bases in the Middle East. It is hard to imagine that the US will sit back and watch China’s influence in the Middle East grow.
Despite many challenges, the resumption of diplomatic relations shows that China has a certain degree of influence on Saudi Arabia and Iran, based on the huge trade volume generated by the crude oil market. In light of this, this resumption of affairs sparked discussion of China’s role in mediating the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and using its influence on both sides to bring peace from the war. Last month, China issued a 12-point statement, “China’s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis,” which proposed respecting the sovereignty of all countries, abandoning the Cold War mentality, ceasing hostilities, resuming peace talks, and resolving the humanitarian crisis. This statement is interpreted as a sign of Beijing’s intention to become a mediator. From March 20th to 22nd, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia. International public opinion generally considers the mediation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine to be a major focus of this state visit. In addition,The Wall Street Journalhas quoted sources as saying that Xi also intends to have a video call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, possibly after his visit to Russia, and that Beijing may play a more active role in brokering an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. However, as I mentioned in my previousarticle, there are still many sceptical voices internationally for Beijing to play the role of mediator in the Ukraine crisis.
First, China views today’s global order as a US-led hegemonic order. Under this global order, the US uses its domestic laws to performlong-arm jurisdictionto interfere with other countries internal affairs and support so-called “justice.” For this reason, theJoint Statementbetween China and Russia on March 21st emphasizes the opposition to hegemony and unilateralism, and it is unacceptable to replace the UN principles and norms of international law with a “rules-based order.” Thus, the US views China and Russia as long-term challengers to its global order. From the Trump administration’s trade war to the Biden administration’s tech war, the US foreign policy shows that the US views China’s challenge to the US as more comprehensive than Russia’s. The US, of course, not only will not accept China as a mediator in the Ukraine war but also view the war as a strategic opportunity to call upon the international community under its leadership to weaken China. To achieve this strategic goal, the US is shaping an international public opinion campaign that China is on the side of Russia on the issue of the Ukraine war. On March 18th,Kyodo Newsquoted a US State Department official as saying that the US had confirmed that Chinese-made ammunition had been used on the battlefield in Ukraine, but it was not clear whether the ammunition had been supplied by China. “Russia would be free, then, to use a ceasefire to only further entrench their positions in Ukraine. To rebuild, refit and refresh their forces so that they can restart attacks on Ukraine at a time of their choosing. We do not believe that this is a step towards a just and global peace.” said National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby on March 17th. Kirby made it clear that the US “does not support China’s call for a ceasefire at this time.”
The US campaign in the West was successful to a certain extent. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, once also questioned China’s position, as the statement of Sino-Russian “unlimited friendship” was made earlier last year. Nevertheless, there is not a complete lack of consensus and cooperation room between China and the EU on the Russo-Ukrainian war. The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, will visit China on March 31st to discuss with President Xi the issue of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Hesaidon March 24th that China is a global player and the world must listen to its voice in seeking an end to the war in Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, once met Wang Yi, Director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, andstressedthat in the face of an increasingly complex international situation, France and China should world together to maintain stability and balance, uphold multilateralism, oppose bloc confrontation, and avoid the division of the world. In other words, both China and France have a consensus to avoid turning this world into a “New Cold War” in terms of the Russo-Ukraine war or the US-China competition. This echoes China’s view about abandoning the Cold War mentality. On the first day of Xi’s visit to Russia, March 20th, President Macron just survived two major votes of no confidence in the National Assembly. President Macron, with his ambitious vision of “EU Strategic Autonomy,” is expected to play a more representative and influential role in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Just after the first anniversary of the war between Russian and Ukraine, President Macron publicly stated that he expected to visit China in early April this year. Unlike last year’s visit by Scholz, which was morebusiness-focused, Macron emphasised China’s role in promoting peace during the Russo-Ukrainian war, saying that it was good that China had joined the peace effort, that it had helped Europe to pressure Russia not to use nuclear weapons, and it could further pressure Russia to accept an end to aggression as a precondition for negotiations. After the EU summit on March 24th, President Macron also said he had invited President von der Leyen to join him on his visit to China in order to make a “united voice” to the Chinese government”. Macronarguedthat the EU must do everything possible to get China on its side, to put pressure on Russia to prevent the use of chemical and nuclear weapons, to stop the conflict, to return to the negotiating table, and to have international law and Ukraine’s territorial integrity respected.
Given that the fundamental decision of the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in the US and Russia, the key to the success of China’s mediation also lies in the US and Russia. The US’s strategic plans for Ukraine are not something China can reverse, or the EU can dictate. If China can persuade the EU and put pressure on the US and Russia to act prudently over Ukraine, it will be for the best. It is unwise and over-optimistic to talk at every turn about China’s meditator role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The Pharmaceutical Legislation: A Challenge to Solve Everything,"In November 2020, the European Union published thePharmaceutical Strategy for Europe. One of its key initiatives includes the revision of the EU’s general pharmaceutical legislation and the legislation on medicines for children and rare diseases.  The revision, happening for the first time in 20 years, will update the EU general pharmaceuticals legislation.
The new pharmaceutical legislation aims to establish an innovation-focused environment with a strong intellectual property system that supports European industries and promotes regional strategic autonomy. The European Commission has emphasized that the upcoming legislation prioritizes both patient welfare and the competitiveness of the EU industry. Importantly, the process will affect the whole life cycle of medicines, from the way they are developed, authorized, put on the market, and disposed of. The ongoing revision intends to simplify the existing regulatory framework, which consists ofRegulation 726/2004,Regulation 141/2000, Regulation 1901/2006, andDirective 2001/83, and compile it into one Regulation and one Directive. Additionally, the package includes Council Conclusions on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).
Following the publication of thePharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, the roadmap/inception impact assessment was published on 30 March 2021. The feedback period saw good participation from European stakeholders active in EU health policy. The Commission’s legislative proposal for this revision was initially planned to be adopted in December 2022 but it was finally presented on 26 April 2023. The package had been postponed at least three times, the last one being from 29 March 2023 to 26 April 2023, causingmajor criticismfrom different Members of the European Parliament, who eagerly awaited the publication of these proposals to start negotiations as soon as possible. Now that the proposal has been introduced, it is the turn of the European Parliament and the Council to begin negotiations that lead to a compromise text. European’s Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (EP ENVI) is the one to lea the file at the Parliament level. Once the approval of Council and Parliament is achieved, the report is set for vote at the EP Plenary. However, given the length and complexity of the file, it is not expected to be adopted until 2025.
In early February, POLITICO had access to aleaked draftof the proposal to a first version of the file, that have been watered down for the final version of the text that was presented.  The key measures presented could be summarised in the following points:
On 26 April 2023, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, held apress conferencewith Commissioner for Promoting a European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas to introduce the legislative proposal. She mentioned that the proposal is focused on three A’s: affordability, availability, and accessibility. It brings a set of measures that balance innovation, access, competitiveness, and patient rights.
The proposal includes measures such as modulation of regulatory data protection, TEVs, shortage plans or environmental assessments that affect pharmaceutical companies, from companiess that manufacture generics to those that develop innovative medicines. Commissioner Kyriakides mentioned during the press conference, and in other events after, about the importance of striking a balance between competitiveness and innovation vis-à-vis access to affordable medicines for all patients.
As it usually happens when the Commission launches a proposal, almost no one is happy about it. Associations like European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations (EFPIA) orMedicines for Europe, representatives of innovative and biosimilar industry respectively, have voiced their concerns regarding the proposal. Overall, they agree on the fact that regulating and reducing the regulatory data protection is, on one hand, dis-incentivising investment in the European pharmaceutical sector, and on the other hand, not bringing the market entry of generics any closer.
Other concerns include higher requirements in terms of environmental risk assessment and the need to create shortage prevention plans and mitigating measures. While, initially, this should not be a problem, in reality it could pose bigger burdens, specially on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
In conclusion, the revision of the pharmaceutical legislation in the EU seeks to create a regulatory framework that supports both the industry and the European citizens. However, the challenges surrounding the new proposal were only further sparked by its constant delays. The files are already at Parliament and Council levels and negotiations are likely to start progressing soon.  Upcoming negotiations and outreach activities will shape the final outcome of the pharmaceutical legislation, which will try to ensure a fair solution that benefits patients and promote a thriving innovative and competitive environment for the pharmaceutical companies in the region.  The legislative proposal is unlikely to become effective before 2025 and, given the interplay of interests of such diverse groups, the final outcome is sure to disappoint some of them regardless of amendments.
This review is happening for the first time in 20 years, whether it is a well-seized or wasted opportunity, time will tell.
Who will be the final winners/losers of the final text?
Will the EU need to adopt other measures before the legislation is finalized by 2025?
Will this mandate of the European Parliament finish negotiations before elections?

The Great Enemies Reconcile: Beijing host meetings between Saudi Arabia and Iran,"On March 6, 2023, representatives fromIran and Saudi Arabia met in Beijing; four days later, Riyadh and Tehran declared their decision to normalise relations.
Saudi Arabia and Iran share atroubled history. Aspirations for regional leadership, oil export policies, and relations with the United States and other Western nations are only a few geopolitical issues among several others that have strained the relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia and Iran have intensified their rivalry in every aspect of the regional conflict, from taking opposing sides in thecivil wars in Yemen and Syriato their affiliations with international alliances.Religionalso plays an important role in defining the geopolitical contrasts between the two powers: Saudi Arabia presents itself as the champion of Sunni religiosity, while the ambitious Iran has made the Shiite revolution its banner and attempts to use the Shiite cells scattered throughout the Middle East to expand its influence over the region.
Given the ongoing cold war between the two regional powers, this historic agreement comes as a real surprise. By realigning the region’s major powers, the accord has the potential to de-escalate the simmering conflicts throughout the Middle East by eclipsing the current gap between Iran and the Arab world with a complex network of connections.
The reconciliation takes place as Iran experiencesgrowing isolationon the international scene and Saudi Arabia shifts the focus of its foreign policy from hostility tonegotiation. Saudi Arabia and its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, have made efforts lately to patch things up with the majority of their opponents in the area, includingIsrael.
As stated by theForeign Ministry of Saudi Arabia, the two countries agreed to resume diplomatic relations, reopen the embassies, and honour their  commitment to respect the sovereignty of states and non-interference in internal affairs. They also agreed to implement the Security Cooperation Agreement and the General Agreement for Cooperation in the Fields of Economy, Trade, Investment, Technology, Science, Culture, Sports, and Youth. Additionally, “the three countries expressed their keenness to exert all efforts towards enhancing regional and international peace and security,” thestatementsaid.
The diplomatic and geopolitical consequences of the agreement ricocheting on the regional and international level include, on the one hand, impacting the web of relations in the Middle East and possibly alleviating tensions in multiple ongoing conflicts. On the other hand, China’s hosting of the meeting provides the grand scenario for this turning point, weaving the region into China’s global ambitions and giving Beijing a great leap forward in its rivalry with Washington.
On the regional level, the dispute between Riyadh and Iran has had a particularly negative impact onYemen. A Saudi-led coalition entered Yemen in 2015 to battle the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who had taken control of the country after the two countries supported opposing sides in the Yemeni civil war that began in 2014. The Iranian mission to the United Nations has recently stated that the reconciliation “would accelerate the ceasefire, help start a national dialogue, and form an inclusive national government in Yemen,” Iran’s state news agencyIRNAreported.
​​Additionally, Syria’s importance cannot be underestimated. TheSyrian civil warfront is crucial to understanding the delicate power dynamics and alliances in the area: the regime receivedsupportfrom Russia, China, Iran, and Hizbollah, the largest Lebanese Shiite paramilitary organisation, while the anti-regime opposition saw the U.S., the European Union, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and several Arab states among its supporters. Asad’s Syria is geographically and strategically crucial, as it acts as a territorial bridge and allows Iran to transit arms and aid to Hizbollah, which has always been committed to rebalancing the struggle for power with Israel.
The arrangement was first met withopposition by Benjamin Netanyahu‘s new administration in Israel. Despite efforts from Israel and Saudi Arabia to reconcile and create a new delicate chessboard of diplomatic ties, a wider opening between the two is unlikely to occur without significant advancement on the Palestinian front, which seems unachievable given the stance of the current Israeli administration. The Abraham Accords allowed Israel to sit a little more comfortably in the powder keg that is the Arab Middle East. Nothing would please Netanyahu more than a larger normalisation that covers Saudi Arabia; hence, Riyadh could exert significant diplomatic pressure on Israel about the Palestinian issue.
But these agreements are yet to address the elephant in the room: Saudi Arabia, along with many other regional and foreign nations, is gravely worried aboutIran’s nuclear program. The P5+1 discussions (including the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, China, and France, together with Germany) have long served as the primary platform for engaging Iran in diplomatic endeavours; however, they did not incorporate important Middle Eastern nations. The Saudi-Iranian negotiations, which were mediated by Beijing, may provide a small window of opportunity. Yet, in order for these bilateral discussions to be substantive and significant, they must address regional worries about Iran’s nuclear program; otherwise, the openness will be purely symbolic.
On the international level, the fact that this historic reconciliation was brokered by China vaults it into a new league diplomatically and leaves Washington on the sidelines. Therelations between the USA and Saudi Arabiahave been a bit turbulent lately, consequently to Riyadh’s will to break free of Washington’s hold. Saudi Arabia views itself as a regional power capable of participating independently in global affairs rather than as the United States’ security vassal. On the other hand, Iran has managed to maintain close ties with Russia and now China. Hampered by sanctions resulting from the nuclear issue and attempting to break free from the isolation imposed by Washington, Teheran is elevating China in the region as the privileged foreign interlocutor to negotiate with the Saudis. China’s presence in the MENA area is growing thanks to its policy based on soft power and its win-win approach, thanks to which Beijing demonstrates agility in taking advantage of some dissatisfaction directed at the United States and of thepolitical vacuum left by Washingtonfollowing its progressive withdrawal from the region. With strong trade, military, and intelligence ties to most of the important players in the Middle East, the United States still holds its influence; but China’s expansion in multiple fields – military bases in the region, vaccines, logistics, commodities, and the control of thesupply chain for new critical minerals– makes clear that its pursuit of resources and influence goes beyond Asia. And as evidenced by Beijing’s engagement in the Saudi-Iranian dispute, there is another key player to consider in the MENA region’s ever-changing chessboard.","April 28, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-great-enemies-reconcile-beijing-host-meetings-between-saudi-arabia-and-iran/,Beatrice Ala,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
India’s G20 Presidency: Opportunities and Challenges,"If you arrived in a major Indian city right now, posters and installations of India’s G20 logo would cram your field of vision. The logo clad in a green and saffron gradient with the “0” representing the planet placed on a lotus, is highly reminiscent of the ruling party’s symbol of the saffron lotus. From airports to government offices and trains, you will have hoardings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcoming you to the “mother of democracy” and letting everyone know that India is hosting the year’s G20.
Perhaps this is precisely what’s peculiar about the Indian chapter. Very rarely does the electoral public become an active participant in the foreign policy of a country. The government has successfully redefined foreign policy objectives (previously reserved for the few) to include not just the citizens of the country but the world’s citizens as a whole.
India is currently presiding over the most powerful economic grouping in the world – the Group of Twenty (G20), a premier forum for international economic cooperation. The group comprises 19 of the world’s leading developed and developing countries. This year’s Summit will be held in New Delhi on September 9-10. Its meetings are being held across all 28 states and the 8 Union Territories of India. Taking over from Indonesia, the presidency began on 1st December 2022 and will last till November 30th, 2023.
India has described its presidency as a one of healing, harmony and hope. The theme of the presidency highlightsLiFE(Lifestyle for Environment) which conceptualises the idea of an action oriented agenda to shape an inclusive and sustainable world.  Also driven by a pragmatic, national interest oriented foreign policy, the country aims to utilise its leadership of the G20 to reaffirm its global status and influence the shaping of a new world order through the propagation of its cultural and civilisational values.
India has assumed the presidency at a time of political division (emphasized with the Ukrainian war), mistrust between major powers, and when global governing bodies, like the UN, have become mere spectators.Therefore, presiding over the influential G20 at a critical point in international politics can be perceived as both a challenge and an opportunity for India.
India, as a leading developing economy, has always been considered the leader of the Global South. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankarstatedthat India, unlike the chairs before, would use its G20 presidency to put across concerns of the Global South.
India’s emotional solidarity with the Global South had begun with its rejection of the Cold War bloc politics. The country was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, formed to foster cooperation between developing and underdeveloped nations. This cooperation was based on the shared history of colonialism, poverty and underdevelopment. India envisages the forum as a platform to act on the unique challenges faced by the developing world; which include the disproportionate impact of the climate crisis, poverty, unemployment, and severe socio-economic inequalities.
A major demand of the Global South is therestructuring of the global economic orderthat still favours the developed world. Critics of the G20 allege that the forum, as influential as it is, operates to preserve the existing international monetary system and the global economic governance that serves the interests of corporations as well as the powerful and wealthy in the developed and the developing countries. Interestingly, the G20 was formed in 1999, in the backdrop of the economic crisis that swept across East Asia; the objective of the newly formed forum was the design of a new financial architecture. However, not much was achieved in turning around the global economic framework to take into consideration the interests of underdeveloped nations.
In the meetings so far, an issue that has proved to be the obvious elephant in the room has been Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in March, US Secretary of StateAnthony Blinken called on Russiato pull back its forces and the forum to back it. The issue is further complicated byIndia’s neutral position, and as host, it does not want its presidency to be dominated by discourses on the war. Instead, it wishes to focus on the food and energy crisis that has emerged due to the war and one that has unfairly affected the less developed nations. Nevertheless, India is aware of the opportunity that arises with the attendance of Western and Russian interlocutors at its meetings. If it manages dialogue between the two (a bleak probability), it could claim a diplomatic win.
Hostile relations between the US and China could also prove challenging just as hostilities between India and Pakistan do. Pakistan has harshlyobjectedto India’s holding the G20 events in Kashmir. Such tensions between the G20 members could hinder the ability of the forum to come to a consensus.
Moreover, the urgency to tackle the climate crisis looms large upon the members of the G20. As the developing nations unfairly bear the brunt of the crisis, the forum has a major responsibility in jointly addressing it. India has prioritised the environment for the G20 through its proposal of a ‘Green Development Pact.’
India approaches the G20 presidency as the finest opportunity to showcase its growth as a global power. As a regional power exuding significant influence in the subcontinent and increasingly acting as a global player, the Indian foreign policy outlook has shifted from its previous policy ofnon-alignment to multi-alignment. This shift may have caused some to accuse India of betraying its commitments to South-South cooperation and jeopardise Global South demands.
A radical change in the Indian foreign policy agenda is the work of the Narendra Modi government that came to power in 2014. An assertive and independent attitude driven along the lines of multilateralism was adopted; paving the way for intensified and balanced relations with both the West and the East. While it may have complicated India’s positioning on certain matters on the global stage, such as the war between the West and Russia, the country no more shies away from outspokenly promoting its strategic interests in the region and beyond. On the pretext of the G20, Prime Minister Modi hasspokenthat multilateralism and global governance have failed, a remark that suggests that India sees itself as being the objective judge of world politics. In such a scenario, the country seems well-equipped to deal with the challenges that may arise during the presidency.
The Indian government may have gone to extreme lengths to promote its G20 presidency domestically in hopes of either clout or electoral advantage. But on the world stage, it is to further the long-term need for changing the biased world order. India believes that apermanent membership in the UN Security Councilwill be a step toward balancing the new global power dynamics.

"(Analysis) Croatia, The Long Journey To Eurozone And Schengen Area","On July 1st, 2013,Croatiabecame a member state of the European Union, and 9.5 years later, the country became part of theEurozone and Schengen Area. At the same time.While Croatia gained a lot of advantages immediately after becoming an EU member state, accession to the Eurozone and Schengen Area is not automatic. Currently, all member states except for Denmark are required to join the eurozone as Denmark negotiated to opt out of the bloc’s currency. All member states who were already part of the bloc when the Maastricht Treaty was passed agreed to join the eurozone or agreed to join as a condition of their accession.
In order to use the euro currency, Croatia had to demonstrateeconomic preparation. Considering there is no way for EU member states to stop using the euro once they officially adopt it (apart from leaving the bloc), member states must meet several requirements to demonstrate economic readiness. The European Central Bank controls the monetary policy of the bloc, whereas member states that do not use the euro control their monetary policies through national central banks.
To use the euro, a member state must meetrequirementsregarding price stability, sound and sustainable public finances, exchange-rate stability, and long-term interest rates. To demonstrate price stability, the member state must not have an inflation rate 1.5% higher than the interest rate of the three best-performing member states in the Eurozone. For sound and sustainable public finances, the member state cannot be a part of the European Union’sExcessive Deficit Procedure. Member states risk becoming subject to the Excessive Deficit Procedure if their annual deficit exceeds 3 percent of their GDP and/or the total government deficit exceeds 60%. Currently, onlyRomaniais under the Excessive Deficit Procedure.
To date, every single member state has been a part of theprocedureat some point, including the United Kingdombefore leaving the European Union. Next, the member state must participate in theExchange Rate Mechanism(ERM II) for at least two years. In this mechanism, the member state establishes a currency bilateral central rate with the euro, in which devaluation is not possible, and the exchange rate cannot be more or less than 15% of the central rate. Finally, the long-term interest rate cannot be more than 2% above the long-term interest rates of the three best-performing member states.
The requirements to join the eurozone ensure that member states can cope without manipulating monetary policy during economic downturns. The European Central Bank has a high level ofindependencefrom the influence of member states and other EU institutions. This guides the monetary policy in a way that is designed to benefit EU member states as a group. Votes in the European Central Bank are private, which prevents members of the board from feeling pressured to vote in a way that benefits their own member state. While the final vote outcome is available to the public, how each member voted is not.
Unfortunately, and confirming the concerns of some citizens, inflation has hitCroatiadue to switching currencies. Businesses that raised prices have attempted to explain the higher prices byblaming inflation, but the government does not accept this explanation. Inflation occurred as soon as businesses started accepting euros as payment, but stores not using the exchange rate of7.53 kuna to a eurorisk a fine from a government inspector. Despite having lower wages than in Slovenia, some consumers have complained that prices are now higher in Croatia compared to their neighbors in the north. Consumers in Croatia reported price increases as high as50%when the currency switched. After inspectors spent two weeks conducting price controls, they found that40%of businesses had unjustifiable price increases.
Due to the price increases, political opposition leaders are upset that the government introduced the euro currency to Croatia during an energy crisis and high inflation. The reality, however, is that when the political opposition attempted to force the government to have areferendumon the Euro, they fell short of the necessary signatures. Instead of 370,000 signatures (10% of the electorate), the opposition received only 336,000 signatures on the petition. In 2021, the Fitch rating agency also predicted that Croatia would seek to join the eurozone inearly 2023.
Not all nations in the Schengen Area areEuropean Unionmember states. Four members of the Schengen Area – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland – have not joined the European Union. After Croatia joined on January 1st of this year, Cyprus, Bulgaria, and Romania are the remaining EU member states that still have restrictions as part of the Schengen Area, whilst Ireland remains entirely excluded from the Schengen Area. TheSchengen Areadates back to1985, the year of its agreement, and its name comes from the village of Schengen in Luxembourg. It had five original members – Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
Despite being agreed upon in 1985, the Schengen Area’s official signing was not until1990, establishing the abolition of internal borders, a single visa for the entire area, and one database across all member states (called the Schengen Information System). Italy joined only five months after the convention was signed, and the expansion of the Schengen Area took off quickly.
In1995with the passage of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Schengen Area finally became part of the European Union. Before 1995, it was completely separate from the European Union. Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland joined the Schengen Area before it became part of the European Union, explaining why they are members of the Schengen Area yet not the EU. The benefits of the Schengen Area are clear,3.5 millionEuropean citizens cross internal national borders daily without going through security checks. To allow for this free movement of everyone in the area and not just citizens, the member states of the Schengen Area have a common visa policy.
Similar to the Eurozone, the Schengen Area has entry requirements. This is why Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Romania have not yet joined as they still do not meet theentry requirements. As part of their European Union membership, all three nations are legally-required to join the Schengen Area when they are prepared to do so.Austriacontinues to blockRomaniaandBulgariafrom entering the Schengen Area due to a concern about potential illegal immigration to Austria. The Austrian government, in other words, is concerned that Bulgaria and Romania are not yet prepared to protect the Schengen’s area external border from illegal immigration.
Bulgaria bordersTurkey, which is not yet a member state. Meanwhile, Romania borders Ukraine and Moldova, nations that are neither part of the European Union nor the Schengen Area.The Netherlandsalso does not believe Bulgaria is ready, and further actions are needed to confront corruption and organized crime.
Ireland is not part of the Schengen Area and is not legally required to join.Irelandchose not to become a founding member of the Schengen Area due to the Common Travel Agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom in place since1922when Ireland became an independent nation. Had Ireland joined the Schengen Area, it would have resulted in the voiding of the Common Travel Agreement due to the United Kingdom having no interest in joining. Joining the Schengen Area for Ireland would require a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and considering the conflictual past between the two nations, it is clear how decision-makers would want to avoid further points of contention.
While being a member state of the Schengen Area means maintaining open internal borders, nations within the Schengen Area cantemporarilyreintroduce border controls under special circumstances. There must be a threat to internal security or public policy for the temporary reintroduction of internal borders, an example being theCOVID-19 pandemic, in which many member states did so due to the widespread introduction of vaccination requirements for the right of entry at national borders. Information on the temporary reintroduction of national border notifications is publicly available on the European Commission website. Below this paragraph is an example of the details included.
“The reason why border controls are being temporarily reintroduced determines the duration of the controls. For foreseeable events such as sports events, border controls can be introduced for30 daysor for how long the event lasts, but the duration can be extended for up to 6 months. For foreseeable events, the European Commission and all member states must be notified a minimum of4 weeksbefore the border controls are imposed.”
While members have to maintain the free movement of people within the Schengen Area, the external borders require protection. For Croatia, this is significant as it borders Serbia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Montenegro, all of which are not yet members of the Schengen Area. As previously mentioned,Austriahas highlighted the importance of protecting the Schengen Area’s external border to stem the flow of illegal immigration to other member states. This, however, is not always simple, particularly when the Southern Schengen Area member states: France, Greece, Italy, Malta, and Spain, all border the Mediterranean Sea.
While there is a desire to prevent people from illegally entering the Schengen Area, there is also concern over the loss of life. The Mediterranean Sea has been referred to as a ‘graveyard‘ for years now due to the rising number of migrants who have died attempting to make the dangerous voyage.
Croatia hopes it can utilize the free movement of EU citizens throughout the Schengen Area to its benefit and boost tourism to the nation. Tourism is already responsible for20 percentof Croatia’s economy. Starting from January 1st, Croatia’s land and sea borders come under the freedom of movement exception, but passports were still a requirement for air travel. Theair border, however, was abolished on March 26th.
Time will tell whether this will successfully increase Croatia’s tourism and bring economic benefits. Ideally, Croatia’s economy will become morediversifiedand not so dependent on tourism, but in the meantime, tourism plays a significant role in the economy. From 2013-2018, Croatia’s economy received200 million dollarsfrom tourism solely from the Game of Thrones series.
Besides becoming a member of the Schengen area making it easier for more tourism, so does joining the Eurozone. It means that tourists using the euro no longer have to worry about exchanging currency or potential currency exchange rate fees if paying by card. It is not a simple matter to join either the Eurozone or the Schengen Area, but it has the potential to bring rewards to member states.

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: The End of US Dollar Hegemony?,"Recently, “de-dollarisation” has become a hot topic. The so-called “de-dollarisation” of the world revolves around three main aspects: (1) the currency of international trade settlement, (2) the currency of investment and (3) reserve currency. The main initiatives can be broadly classified into three areas.
First, Brazil andASEANhave started to consider settling trade in local currency.Iraqsaid it would allow trade with China to be settled in Renminbi.Saudi Arabiasaid it was open to using currencies other than the US dollar for trade settlement. Second, the share of foreign investors’ holdings in US Treasuries has declined from the peak of 43% during the 2008 financial crisis to 23.6% by the end of March 2023. Third, central banks start to diversify their reserve asset allocation to achieve “de-dollarisation.” Data show that the US dollar’s share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves fellfrom 71% in 1999 to 58% by the end of 2022.
It is noteworthy that the consideration and action of “de-dollarisation” have emerged in a number of bilateral and multilateral cooperation initiatives in which China is involved. For China, as the issue of “de-dollarisation” is closely linked to the internationalisation of the Renminbi, China’s participation in “de-dollarisation” has been given special significance in the context of the current intensified geopolitical game between China and the US. For example, among theBRICS countries, the issue of “de-dollarisation” is increasingly being discussed, withBrazilian President Lula, who was in China recently, asking why the US dollar must be used in international trade. It is completely possible for the BRICS countries to use local currencies for settlement. In the case of China and Russia, they have already started to “de-dollarise” their trade by using the local currency for settlement.
On the geopolitical front,the US confiscated the Afgan central bank’s US dollar assetsheld in the US and took it upon itself to allocate them. After the break out of the war in Ukraine, the US imposed severe sanctions on Russia, not only freezing assets but also removing Russian banks from the SWIFT  payment system. On the economic front, after the US Federal Reserve’sunlimited QE,domestic inflation in the USis going high andthe purchasing power of the US dollar is declining. In response to inflation, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates, and theSilicon Valley Bank collapsein March is still fresh in our memories. The possibility of an economic recession or even an economic crisis cannot be ruled out in the future in the US. Under such expectations, some countries prudently adjust their dollar reserves. Nevertheless, in the long term, the hegemonic position of the US dollar may be weakened, but its dominant position will remain.
Firstly, the fundamental pattern of US dollar hegemony is unlikely to change in the near future. Although the US dollar is beginning to show signs of diminishing status and influence in the global market, it is still the world’s dominant “world currency” and will remain so for a considerable period of time. Even if some countries do not use the US dollar in their international trade activities in the future, this will not fundamentally shake the US dollar’s international status. Secondly, the status of the US dollar is a matter of US hegemony in general and the US will do anything to protect it. The US dollar is the most important (financial) “product” produced by the US and exported to the world. It is also the central instrument through which the US governs the global economy and financial markets. In the history of the US, the country has not hesitated to wage several wars to destabilise the challenge currency in order to maintain the international status of the US dollar. Third, the market remains relatively risky for non-US dollar transactions with other countries. Countries that are currently willing to settle in local currency, e.g. Russia, Brazil, and the Middle East, etc, have weaker combined economic strengths and tend to have more volatile domestic economies.

Bedlam At The Border: How The Frontier Has Become A Key Issue In Mexico-U.S Relations,"On January 9th 2023, US President Joe Biden and his Mexico counterpart, Andres Manuel López Obrador met for the North American leaders summit in Mexico City, later joined by Canadian premier Justin Trudeau. Themeetingmarked the first time that a US leader has visited Mexico in nearly a decade, which is quite surprising, considering how crucial the Mexico border is, and has always been to US immigration policy. One of the hallmarks of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was the promise to build a structure along the US-Mexico border that would curtail the growing number of illegal crossings into the US and that he would make Mexico pay for it, however, then Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto insisted that Mexico would not cover the cost of the wall. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that whenever heads of state from the two countries convene, the issue of their nearly 3,100km shared border is bound to come up.
In 2023, the issue of the border has yet again reared its ugly head, and there seems to be no immediate solution. The issue of migration persists; every year, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from South American countries seek entry into the U.S through the Mexican border, in search of greener pastures. With the topic of migration being such a contentious issue in the United States, especially around the election period, U.S- Mexico ties are crucial to the process of ensuring that the process is safe and controlled. Another problem that has recently surfaced is that of fentanyl. Fentanyl abuse has been rampant in the United States over the past few years, exacerbated by the ready availability of the drug due to its synthetic nature, with  the U.S- Mexico border being a major entry point.  A deeper look at these two issues is paramount to understanding the position in which Mexico has found itself in early 2023, and what the implications might be for its relations with the U.S.
On March 27 2023, a fire broke out at an immigration detention center in Ciudad Juarez, killing nearly 40 immigrants. This tragic incident shone a spotlight on the challenges faced by the scores of immigrants who make the trek to the U.S border in search of asylum, a journey that very often turns deadly. Mexican President Lopez Obrador blamed the fire on immigrants who were supposedly protesting their deportation. The immigrant situation at the border grows more precarious by the day and will only be exacerbated with the expiration ofTitle 42on May 11.Title 42 is a regulation implemented during the pandemic that authorized the United States to expel asylum seekers without a hearing if they are considered to have entered the country unlawfully. In the wake of the end of Title 42, a huge influx of immigrants is anticipated and Mexico is just as invested in the situation.
During January 2023, an agreement was reached between the U.S and Mexico which stated that Mexico would accept up to 30,000 immigrants per month who were denied asylum in the U.S, specifically from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Cuba. However, Mexico’s increased importance to U.S immigration policy does not bode well for the border towns which are already struggling with the surging numbers of immigrants.
The U.S is seeking Mexico’s cooperation at the border with the issue of fentanyl; a synthetic opioid drug which is sometimes produced illegally and sold on the black market, where it has been associated with a growing number of overdose deaths due to its high potency. According toa report by the Wilson Center, while Chinese companies are responsible for the majority of fentanyl production, Mexico is becoming a major transit and production point for the drug.
Bilateral cooperation seems to be the logical solution yet the two governments have differing views. President Lopez Obrador framed fentanyl as an American problem and blamed it on thelack of hugs. The U.S, on the other hand, believes that the Mexican cartels are heavily involved in the product’s circulation and Republicans have even suggested military intervention as a means to curb the supply of fentanyl from the south of the border. This is an issue that will only persist unless the two governments are able to agree on a joint solution, which is easier said than done.
President Biden has certainly taken a warmer approach to Mexico than his predecessor Donald Trump, pressure from the GOP on the aforementioned issues of immigration and fentanyl supply may alter his approach. Indeed, he delayed the end of Title 42 for nearly two months, as he was being criticised by both Democrats and Republicans. President Lopez Obrador seems to prefer focusing on the issues in Mexico, particularly security, especially with the 2024 presidential elections coming up. However, the importance of the U.S as a strategic partner means that he might compromise on some issues in order to appease his northern neighbours. The arrest of  Ovidio Guzman, the son of Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman and a high-ranking member of the Sinaloa cartel, was seen as a token of good faith to the U.S, as the Sinaloa cartel is believed to be heavily involved in the fentanyl drug trade.
With both countries slated to hold presidential elections in 2024, cooperation is at a crucial point and issues pertaining to the border will be a key factor.

Democratic Backsliding and Self-Centered Foreign Policy: Hungary-EU Relations in Perils,"The relationship between Hungary and the European Union (EU) has been characterized bytension and conflict,particularly with therise to power of Viktor Orbán’s nationalist, conservative right-wing populist party, Fidesz, in 2010. Since then,the Hungarian government has enacted numerous legislative acts that undermine democracy, human rights, and the freedoms of its citizens. Consequently, the actions of Fidesz and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have become a significant test for Hungarian political institutions and civil society. The nature of the Hungarian government has been subject to various interpretations, such as ahybrid regime,non-democratic regime, orilliberal democracy. While specific definitions may not be necessary, it is traceable that Hungary’s democratic backsliding is a pressing issue for Hungarian citizens, whose rights are being undermined, and the EU as a whole.
The Hungarian government’strajectory towards authoritarianismposes a grave threat to the EU and its very existence. As a unique, multi-level political entity comprising liberal democracies, the EU cannot overlook the fact that it harbours a complete hybrid regime among its members. This represents a fundamental challenge to the EU’s core values, as Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) outlines. Moreover, theHungarian government introduced significant constitutional changes in 2011that altered the powers of the Constitutional Court and the president, created uneven political opportunities among key players in Hungarian politics, favoured the ruling forces, and restricted the playing field for the opposition. The government is also known forimplementing anti-LGBTQ lawsanddiscriminating assylum-seekers by not compying with the EU migration and asylum policy. In practice, the Hungarian government has pursued policies that are at odds with the EU values, resulting in substantial damage to the EU’s international standing and its ability to act as a unified entity.
It is worth noting that Hungary’s democratic backsliding has far-reaching effects on the stability and internal cohesion of the EU. Whilefar-right parties have gained popularity across the EU, particularly in countries like the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Italy, and Greece, Hungary stands out due to the significant deterioration of human rights and the normalization of authoritarian rule. The Hungarian approach may be an attractive model for other EU countries to follow, potentially leading to a shift from democratic governance to authoritarianism. Once a country deviates from democratic norms, it becomes increasingly challenging to revert to the right path.Hungary is currently the only EU member state rated as “Partly Free” by Freedom House, underscoring the extent of its democratic decline.
These developments concern the EU and its leaders, who are keen to normalize relations with Budapest. However, they face numerous obstacles in their efforts to hold Hungary accountable. Notably, the EU has never imposed sanctions on a member state, and setting a precedent with Hungary could fuel anti-EU sentiments. Although, the procedure underArticle 7 TEUwas triggered against Hungary, which might proceed to the stage where the member state could be deprived of its voting rights in the EU Council. One should remember that the EU has been prudent in interfering in its members’ internal affairs, making restoring democracy in Hungary particularly sensitive. If mishandled,it could lead to criticism of EU institutions for violating sovereigntyby Hungary and potentially supported by other member states. Nonetheless, the EU is now determined not to allow the situation to spiral out of control, as prolonged inaction would have increasingly severe consequences.
Hungary’s democratic backsliding poses a significant danger and inflicts collateral damage on the EU’s external affairs, particularly its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).Hungary has been actively blocking or impeding various initiatives proposed by Brussels, especially those pertaining to the EU’s international relations. For instance, Hungary’s obstructionist stance has hindered the EU’s response to the Russian war against Ukraine and the implementation of sanctions against the aggressor. Moreover, theHungarian situation has far-reaching implications for the EU’s Enlargement policy, further complicating relations with the Western Balkans and the EU’s Associated Trio. This raises an important question: Should aspiring member states still be required to meet the political, economic, and other obligations (Copenhagen criteria) to join the bloc, considering that Hungary can hardly be regarded as a free, liberal democracy that respects human rights and maintains independent institutions? As the guardian of the EU treaties, the European Commission is now expected to take action to address this issue. Failure to do so will not only worsen relations between the EU and Hungary but also harm connections between Brussels and other member states and the EU’s international partners.
In December 2020,the EU adopted a regulationestablishing a general conditionality regime to protect the Union’s budget. This regulation,based on Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), aims to safeguard the Union’s budget in case EU members breach the rule of law. The regulation was largely prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated the existingrule of law crisis within the EU as states implemented extraordinary measures to combat the virus(e.g. to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the government of Hungary has implemented a“state of danger”as regulated by the Fundamental Law, which grants it exceptional competences). These measures created a risk of potential abuse by certain EU members, who could employ authoritarian practices under the guise of COVID-19 response. The regulation might be the first step to fighting the authoritarian wave in the EU.
The conditionality mechanism introduced by this regulation allows forthe imposition of restrictive measures on a member state in the event of a breach of the rule of law and a threat to the EU’s financial stability, including the withholding of funding.On April 27th, 2022, shortly after the Hungarian elections,the European Commission formally informed Budapestthat it was activating the conditionality mechanism against Hungary. This serves as a significant signal to Budapest, as estimations suggest that Hungary stands to lose approximately 7.5 billion euros, a catastrophic outcome for the country. Furthermore, the EU has decided to freeze the allocation of around 5.8 billion euros from the Recovery and Resilience Facility, an initiative designed to support Member States in their post-pandemic recovery. This means thatHungary could lose funding equivalent to 8.5% of its GDPif it fails to implement necessary reforms and improve the rule of law situation.
This development is highly unfavourable for Hungary, as it is currently grappling withthe urgent need to stabilize its economy and combat inflation, which stood atover 25% in March 2023. However, there are widespread concerns that the conditionality mechanism is imperfect, and scepticism prevails regarding its ability to induce meaningful behavioural changes in Hungary. To address the EU Commission’s concerns regarding the problematic rule of law situation, Budapest has committed to implementing17 remedial measuresin the hopes of negotiating and resolving the dispute. These measures include strengthening anti-corruption efforts, ensuring transparent use of EU funds, and enhancing overall transparency.
Nonetheless,analysts still worrythat even if Hungary adopts the proposed steps, it will not effectively strengthen democracy and the rule of law due to deeply entrenched illiberal practices andconcerns about the judicial system’s independence. The key issue lies in Hungary’s ability to faithfully implement the 17 remedial measures in a legally binding manner. Consequently, if Hungary successfully unblocks EU funds without significantly improving democracy, accountability, and the rule of law, it would set a major precedent and demonstrate that illiberal regimes are welcome to reinforce authoritarian rule by making superficial changes to access EU disbursements.
However, applying the conditionality mechanism has its cons, as it might invite strong criticism of the EU institutions in case of failure. Such criticism would highlight their inability to effectively address illiberalism within the EU borders. Additionally, triggering the conditionality mechanism solely against Hungary raises questions about how other member states that occasionally violate EU treaties and experience democratic backsliding are treated. This concern extends beyond the EU’s Eastern flank, encompassing other countries of the Union. In fact, by using the conditionality mechanism exclusively for Hungary, the EU and its institutions risk facing further criticism for their perceived “double standards” and the ambiguous nature of their decisions. This could further undermine the EU internally and provide Hungary with leverage to build a coalition of dissatisfied countries within the EU, weakening the Union and imposing additional constraints on its ability to act as a leading international actor.
It is worth noting thatHungarian foreign policyhas remained the same since Orbán’s government came to power, andthe full-scale Russian invasion did not bring any significant changes. Budapest’s approach to international relations revolves around positioning itself between major powers and pursuinga path of balance. This allows the state and Prime Minister Orbán to safeguard vital national interests. The Hungarian balancing act is evident in its foreign policy behaviour, characterized by escalating anti-Western rhetoric and criticism towards the EU while simultaneously deepening ties with authoritarian regimes. Another major authoritarian partner besides Russia is China, which wields considerable influence in Hungary through projects financed by Beijing, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (the Budapest-Belgrade railway, for instance).
The EU responded firmly to the onset of a full-scale Russian invasion by imposing restrictive measures against Moscow. In February 2023, the EU introduced its10th package of sanctions against Russia. Throughout the EU’s response, Hungary’s position has been viewed as one of the main obstacles to unified action. Budapest did not outright block sanctions but often resorted to blackmail,threats of veto, and attempts to limit or delay the scope of anti-Russian measures. There could be various explanations for this behaviour, ranging frompressuring Brussels to unfreeze assets for Hungary, consolidating the government’s power by portraying the EU as responsible for the country’s poor well-being and economic performance, or simply due toHungary’s high dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Consequently, Budapest is particularly concerned about any EU sanctions targeting Russian oil and gas. It hasactively negotiated new deals with Moscow, despite other EU countries attempting to reduce their reliance on Russia.
Regarding anti-Russian sanctions, Hungarian officials have adopted a line of criticism that aligns with Kremlin propaganda.Budapest’s position suggests that the sanctions against Moscow have proven ineffectiveand failed to stop the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. Moreover, Hungary and other EU member states are portrayed as suffering more from the imposed sanctions than the Russian economy itself. This stance explains Hungary’s reluctance to agree on further restrictive measures. Additionally, Hungary has outlined its red lines,opposing sanctions against the Russian nuclear energy industry. This concerns Russia’s state nuclear company, Rosatom, involved in Hungary, particularly inproviding built-in water-water energetic reactors for the Hungarian Paks nuclear power plant. Hungary aims to preserve its ties with Russia to secure additional economic benefits and balance Western influence, aligning with Orbán’s belief that the neoliberal system has failed and the old, US-led liberal order is obsolete. Hungary sees the rise of two powerful authoritarian rivals, Russia and China, as catalysts to overthrow American dominance permanently.
Interestingly, public opinion polls in Hungary indicate that97% of respondents are against restrictive measures against Russia. However, doubts arise about the credibility of these polls. Labelling the sanctions as “Brussels’ sanctions” fails to reflect the reality that many member states support pressuring Russia through sanctions. The relations between Brussels and Budapest are becoming increasingly strained, not only due to sanctions. For instance, Hungary, citing preserving peace, security, and the safety of the Hungarian community in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia region,refused to allow weapons transit to Ukraine via its territory.
Furthermore, due to the Hungarian veto, there were difficulties in the EUreaching an agreement on allocating funds from the European Peace Facilityto finance Ukraine’s military aid, worth around €500 million. It is crucial to remember that the EU can only be strong when it speaks with one voice and remains united. The developments mentioned above highlight that Hungary and Viktor Orbán’s government prioritize their interests over those of the entire bloc.
The government’s actions are clearly aligned withOrbán’s proclaimed “Hungary first” principle, a typical promise made by populist governments to their voters. However, this approach seriously damages the EU’s reputation, credibility, and status in the eyes of its international partners. Alongside Hungary’s democratic decline, Hungarian foreign policy prioritizes national interests above all else and is a significant factor contributing to the escalating tensions between Brussels and Budapest. The EU, whether willingly or not, strives to establish itself as a defence and security actor, but Budapest’s actions present additional challenges.Unsurprisingly, many in Brussels are dissatisfied, as it is unacceptable for a single state to impose such constraints on the collective positions of the other 26 EU members regarding various foreign policy decisions.
We have paid a price for the unanimity principle in EU foreign policy by weakening and delaying our actions.
Discussions regarding more effective and flexible EU foreign and security policy-making are not new. Recent vetoes and Hungary’s efforts to block EU actions and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine have reignited debates on the need to transition from unanimity rule to Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) in the European Council. Led by Germany, the “Group of Friends,” consisting of 9 member states,has pushed for changes to the EU treaties to enhance decision-making capabilities, which is crucial during times of crisis. Shifting to QMV would undoubtedly strengthen the EU by preventing a single state, like Hungary, from blocking Brussels’ decisions. To initiate discussions on treaty change,at least 14 out of 27 member states must be in favour, constituting a simple majority. However, achieving a binding agreement would require ratification from all 27 EU member states. Delays may occur if member states decide to hold national referendums. Despite the promising prospects of this reform, resistance from smaller EU states is expected, asthey might lose their influence on the EU’s foreign policy, because fear bigger states may exploit the reform to make decisions without their consent.
The situation with Hungary has already reached an alarming point, and the EU has been passive and silent in response. The EU faces a paradoxical situation. If it implements the reform, it can enhance its ability to make prompt and resolute decisions. However, this may come at the expense of unity among EU members as Brussels must persuade smaller states first. On the other hand, if the EU delays the reform, countries like Hungary may continue to obstruct united and decisive foreign policy decisions. As a result of the recent elections, Viktor Orbán’s party has secured another term, potentially leading Budapest further down the path of democratic decline and authoritarianism while prioritizing Hungary’s interests over those of the other 26 EU members. This is a deeply concerning situation, particularly given the ongoing major war in Europe since World War II and escalating great power competition. The EU’s ability to respond to these challenges fully is compromised. Thus, engaging in proper and honest dialogue between Hungary and the EU is crucial to overcome the disunity within the bloc and prevent further negative consequences. Addressing the obstacles to EU foreign and security policy decision-making, the rise of authoritarianism, and the deterioration of the rule of law in member states is essential for envisioning a strong EU—the Union which can project considerable power in international affairs only when it speaks with one voice.

Spain: the brothel of Europe to close its doors,"Paid sex in Spain has remained in legal limbo until the recent proposal of the Comprehensive Law Against Trafficking, proposed by the governing Socialist Party of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. In 1995, prostitution was depanelized as a voluntary activity, leading to an unregulated and very successful establishment of the sex industry since then. In fact, not only is Spain the European country with thehighest demand for sex, but is also third internationally. This lack of a jurisdictional model has been criticised by different actors for its lack of a comprehensive approach towards sex workers and the facility it offers to mafias to coerce and exploit victims into the industry. Although the new proposal aims to solve this limbo and social stigma, it is uncertain whether this is the right approach.
A billionaire business
The high demand of paid sex goes hand in hand with a wide acceptance of its consumption. Indeed, prostitution in Spain is a very successful business that is no longer associated with one category of customers. Currently, 18-19 year old teenagers on a night out, to all-men business meetings can comfortably end theirnight in a brothel. Unsurprisingly, to cope with the voluminous demand, there is an estimated 300,000 sex workers in Spain. In 2010, theUnited Nationsestimated that 39% of men in Spain had paid for sex during their lives, an atypical amount compared to other EU countries. What’s more, it is exorbitantly profitable. As of 2016, the UN estimated Spain’s sex industry was worth €3.7 billion. However, the attractiveness of the industry is not limited to nationals, it has also opened the door to “sex tourism”. For instance,  the biggest brothel in Spain “Club Paradise” is found in La Jonquera, located at the border with France, which opens the door to a bigger clientele.
So far, the laws in Spain have been ineffective in tackling the unregulated market of prostitution. Although the activity is allowed, the government draws the limit on the “carnal pound”, meaning no labor rights for sex workers, providing thus an easy outlet for criminality and turning Spain into a magnet for human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
It has been commonly understood that the line between prostitution and sex trafficking is when one or more persons are subjected to engaging with commercial sexual activity. The most common scenario forces victims through coercion, fraud, or force and if they attempt to leave their situation, are blackmailed with their safety and/or their loved ones’. Although Spain has undergone many changes in its legislation and action plans since the 2000s, there is still much room for improvement. Recently, Amnesty International has launched a campaign denouncing the instrumentalization of victims as a means to dismantle a trafficking network and the need to approve a Comprehensive Law against Human Trafficking.
“Not one of the men who paid to sleep with me asked me if I was there out of choice, or whether I wanted to be doing this.They didn’t care either way.”
The abolition of paid sex
Until now, the sexual exploitation of a third party – procurers – was punishable and prosecuted. The free exercise is not regulated at the state level, thus leaving it in the hands of the municipalities. That’s why the approval of the Law against Human Trafficking would pose an advancement. Nonetheless not all parties agree this is the best approach. To begin with, there is no concrete data discerning the line between volunteer and forced sex work. Although the national police and politicians affirm that more than80% of women are coerced into prostitution, these assertions vanish in thin air due to the lack of a real updated figure of prostitution in Spain. Furthermore, the Secretary of Equality – conscious of this information gap – offered a position to gather data and estimate the number of sexually exploited women and girls. The position, however, still remainsvacant. Altogether, the Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos has approved the abolition of prostitution without knowing exactly the figures surrounding thiscontroversial activity.
Moreover, the civil society has denounced the difficulty to ban such a profitable enterprise, predicting the rise of mafias, sexual violence, and even more precarious circumstances. In fact, this situation was happening before the approval of the law: “[t]here are clients who, because they believe that the law is approved, refuse to pay the sex workers or refuse to leave when they have finished the service. It is an appetizer of what will happen in the future”.
The voids that characterize the legality of prostitution have generated many obstacles in the industry for sex workers, including the strengthening of mafias who are comfortably accommodated on the law limits. Civil society workers and victims have demanded a change in legislation requesting better protection mechanisms for many years. Nevertheless, the abolitionist proposal of PSOE is far from the modifications they were asking for, and the consequences of dealing with an entangled and complicated subject in such a superficial manner are  looming.

The Growing Role of Armed Forces in Public Security: Implications and Challenges in Latin America,"The close relationship between the armed forces and politics has undoubtedly been a defining, though at times fluctuating, characteristic in Latin America. The spread of authoritarian political systems in the region, which relied on repression by the armed forces, can be traced back to the second half of the 19th century, particularly with the rise to power of the military leadership of the so-called “caudillos”, a type of authoritarian leader who wields both political and military power. During those years, charismatic figures such as Juan Manuel de Rosas in Argentina and Francisco Solano López Carrillo in Paraguay consolidated their political power through theirclose ties with the military institutionsand the repression they carried out against political dissidents and rebels.
This relationship continued to solidify during the 20th century when the military institutions began to play a role not as subordinates but as predominant actors in the political scene. In the absence of interstate wars fought on the continent, Latin American militarism focused on managing internal social or political conflicts. Especially from the 1960s onwards, as they turned against internal enemies, the armed forces began to intervene in political matters, becoming true “political armies” capable of carrying out coups d’état.
The transition to democracy that began in the 1980s across the region led to a reduction in the influence of military leaders in internal political affairs and a limitation of their role. Themost determining factorsin this process were the fall of the Soviet Union and the strength of public opinion influenced by the widespread dissemination of democratic systems in the region. In particular, the end of the Cold War resulted in a substantial defeat of insurgent guerrilla movements, which had been the central target of state repression and the raison d’être of military regimes.
However, the end of the military regime era did not bring an end to the political debate on the role of the armed forces, and Latin America still grapples with the role of the armed forces in political life today. The internal threats previously represented by left-wing insurgent movements are now mainly linked to the numerous governance challenges, the predominant one being the increase in organized crime. The involvement of numerous armed actors in various criminal economies has given them significant economic and military power capable of challenging state authorities. Governments across the region are reacting by granting greater operational power to the armed forces and providing them with tailored measures.
Although Mexico did not experience a military regime during the Cold War, there werenumerous similaritieswith the authoritarian regimes in the Southern Cone. Anticommunism and arbitrary repression by the armed forces were defining elements of the post-revolutionary governments in Mexico. From 1946, following the election of Miguel Alemán Valdes, the first post-revolution president with no direct involvement in the revolution, the country underwent a process of democratization, resulting in democratic control over the Mexican military institutions.
However, the early 2000s saw policies implemented that increased the power and potential of the military apparatus. Defense spending increased considerably, especially starting in 2006. With the government of Felipe Calderón and his declared war on drug trafficking, the budget for the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA)increased nationally. The deployment of armed forces in Mexican territory and public spending in the defense sector continued under Enrique Peña Nieto and, especially since 2019, under Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO).
During the electoral campaign, AMLO washighly criticalof the militarization of public security carried out by previous administrations. During the presidential campaign before his 2019 victory, AMLO reiterated his intentionto remove the army from the streetsof the country and improve the coordination and professionalization of the police forces at the national level. With the Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) obtaining a large majority in parliament, the first seen since 1997, it was able to reform the constitution and createthe National Guardin its first year in office, formed to reduce the intensity of the war on drugs and replace the federal police whilst integrating the army with a police force controlled by civilian rather than military commands.
But results have not lived up to expectations, or at least what the executive had in mind. Not only has the National Guard been involved in numerouscases of human rights violations, but above all, the promise to demilitarize the country remains unfulfilled, with the trend of militarization in Mexico clearly on the rise. This is demonstrated through figures such as an11% increasein defense sector funds between 2019 and 2022, an already significant54% increase in defense spendingbetween 2018 and 2021, and a76% increasein SEDENA soldiers deployed compared to the Calderón administration.
Available data indeed shows an absolutereductionin human rights violations in Mexico compared to the period of the war on drug trafficking led by Felipe Calderón. However, a concerning fact is the number of homicides in the country, which remains relativelystable. Even more alarming is the death toll related to drug trafficking during the four years of AMLO’s administration. Trends indicate that by the end of his presidential term, the total number of victimsmay surpassthose of the previous administrations. Ultimately, this highlights the substantial ineffectiveness of policies based on the empowerment of the armed forces. It also underscores the dangers of entrusting the management of public security to the National Guard, a military body composed of80% military personnel.
In Peru, internal issues such as the increase in organized crime and the constant flow of irregular migrants at the border with Ecuador have brought back the debate on the role of the armed forces should assume in the face of new security threats.
Firstly, it is necessary to highlight that regarding the role and power of the armed forces in the country, Peru has taken a different path compared to most countries in the region. Following the democratic transition of the late 1980s, the army faced an internal war against the insurgent group Shining Path (SL). The internal conflict led to the armed forces acquiringsignificant power, sometimes surpassing the operational limits defined in the constitution. Power continued to shift to the Armed Forces, especially in 1990, with Alberto Fujimori coming to power with large sectors becoming supporters of the presidential policy. But with Fujimori’s fall in 2000 and the defeat of SL, a process of reorganization and control of the armed forces began.
However, in recent years the issue of militarization of the armed forces in Peruvian territory has once again become part of the national debate. As partially evidenced by thedizzying increasein military spending since the early 2000s, the army in Peru plays an increasingly butnot entirely constitutionalrole as a supporter of the National Police of Peru (PNP). This is mainly due to thelack of preparation and resourcesavailable to the PNP, coupled withnumerous corruption casesthat have led to a loss of credibility for the institution in the fight against organized crime.
In particular, the issue ofconstitutionality and the needfor the use of the armed forces in public security matters regained prominence in early 2021. A few months after taking office, the government of Pedro Castillo authorized the intervention of the armed forces in the control and maintenance of internal order in the country. Castillo declared a state of emergency and deployed the armed forces on the streets of Lima and the adjacent Constitutional Province of Callao. Many international organizations, includingAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have expressed concern about this decision as a disproportionate measure that could lead to human rights violations. Moreover, the militarization of public security in these areas is not yielding positive results, as homicides in the capitalincreased in 2022, with some areas experiencing a tripling or even quadrupling of cases.
This measure also responds to a strategy that the country’s institutions have implemented since the beginning of the pandemic, based on the central role of the army, especially in controlling immigration at the border with Ecuador. Just like the militarization of the streets in Lima and Callao, themilitarization of the border with Ecuadoris also creating fertile ground for human rights violations. Examples of the inadequacy and danger of the army in managing such a delicate issue as the flow of migration at the Ecuadorian border are abundant, including the most emblematic incident when Peruvian army soldiers reportedlyfired shotsat groups of migrants in the border region in January 2021.
The Mexico and Peru cases are just two examples of what is happening at a regional level regarding the control and management of public security. The renewed centrality of the armed forces in Latin American countries should not be confused with the military or heavily authoritarian governments of the Cold War era. Nowadays, generals do not hold political positions or form military juntas, but rather play a role in strengthening governments and their policies. The problem lies precisely in the inadequacy, or rather the incompatibility (and sometimes unconstitutionality), of the armed forces in carrying out the new tasks assigned to them.
In conclusion, the fact that military institutions do not appear to truly assume a political institutional role in governments across the region demonstrates the difference between now and the era of military regimes. However, the danger lies in the weakening of civilian components (PNP in Peru and Federal Police in Mexico) in controlling the armed forces and their actions. Furthermore, This we should not underestimate this risk as it has the potential to create conditions for ongoing abuse of power and human rights violations.

(Analysis) Too Little Too Late? President Biden’s Syrian Policy and Regional Security Implications,"Bashar al-Assad’sregime inSyriais undergoing a diplomatic revival. Nations thatostracizedAssad after the outbreak of the nation’s civil war in 2011, such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have allagreed to normalize relationswith him. Assad was also reinstated as a member of theArab League on May 9after twelve years of suspended membership.
While Assad is enjoying his diplomatic resurgence, AmericanPresident Joe Bidenis facing growing criticismfor not doing anything to prevent it. Since taking office in January 2021, Biden has balked at carrying out his stated policy on Syria and failed to follow American legislation dictating how to react to normalization. Whether Biden decides to follow through with established policy or to accept normalization remains to be seen. Notwithstanding, his decision of whether to act or not could significantly impact the regional security environment for the foreseeable future.
During his campaign for the 2020 presidential election, Bidenpromised to createa more comprehensive approach to marshal the international community to act on Syria and hold Assad accountable. Officially speaking, the Biden Administration has laid outfour policy prioritiesfor ending the conflict in Syria: continuing the campaign against the Islamic State (ISIL), supporting local ceasefires, expanding humanitarian access, and pressing for accountability and respect for international law while promoting human rights and nonproliferation.
However, it is clear that the Biden Administration is not “pressing for accountability” as Middle Eastern nations reestablish diplomatic relations with Assad. Nor is he enforcing American law related to Syria. According to the2019 Caesar Act, the US is supposed to prevent any normalization with the Assad regime. As such, the federal government would have to sanction any nation, whether friend or foe, for opening to Assad.
As the Biden Administration continues to take a passive approach toward curbing normalization, political leaders in Washington are more openly voicing their discontent. InJanuary 2022, the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Foreign Relations Committees wrote that they “urge [Biden] to utilize the robust, mandatory deterrence mechanisms” under the Caesar Act “to maintain the Assad regime’s isolation.” They followed this up again inMarch 2023, highlighting their apparent frustration with the “disappointingly slow pace of sanctions under the Caesar Act” while also arguing “more can be done to ensure that perpetrators of atrocities in Syria face consequences for their actions.” Despite this vocal opposition to Biden’s inaction, officials insist that the administration’s Syria policy “remains unchanged.”
While Arab states were quick to break relations with Syria in 2011, a slow thawing of relations has brought back the Assad government into the regional fold. American allies have notably been at the forefront of this shift. In late 2018 and early 2019,the UAEandBahrainrestored formal ties with Assad. In the summer of 2021,Jordandecided to do so as well.
More recently, Assad has been capitalizing on tragedy to bolster his standing with other states in the Arab world. On February 6, earthquakes struck northern Syria and southern Turkey. The impact was worse on the Turkish side, but6,000 Syriansare believed to have lost their lives, and some estimates envision around$5 billionwill be needed to rebuild the affected areas. Assad has taken advantage of this event to generate sympathy for the victims, normalize relations with others, and influence international opinion on sanctions in what some call “earthquake diplomacy.”
Since the earthquake, Assad has received the Jordanian and Egyptian foreign ministers and visited the UAE and Oman. More crucially, Saudi Arabia has joined the fold of warming up to Assad since the natural disaster. In early March, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saudargued that attempts at isolating Syria were not workingand that engagement with the Syrian government was needed. After increased dialogue between Syrian and Saudi officials throughout March and April,Riyadh decided to reestablish diplomatic relationson May 9.
Renewed relations between Arab states and Syria have three primary causes. The first of which is the acceptance that Assad is here to stay. By recent estimates, he has expanded government control over Syrian territory from20 percentin Spring 2013 to70 percent. Foreign attempts to oust Assad from power, notably the American “maximum pressure” approach, have seemingly failed. The only chance of Assad leaving power appears to be byresigning, which he hasrefused to do on multiple reprieves, andall indicationspoint to the fact he will not abandon his position any time soon. As such, Arab states recognize it is best to work with whoever is in power if they are here to stay.
The second reason is Arab states want to prevent the total collapse of Syria, and they will have to work with whoever is in power to do just that. Many analysts have classified Syria as afailed state, but the situation could continue to worsen. The Syrian economy is currently at itsweakest pointsince the outbreak of the civil war. These Arab states could fear that if they do not work with Assad and extend an economic lifeline, renewed violence against the regime could recommence and spill into the wider region.
The third reason is that working with Assad could serve as a mechanism to weaken Iranian influence in the country and the wider Arab region as a whole. Iran and Syria have long enjoyed aclose relationship, which Tehran has exploitedto expand its influence beyond its border and encroach on Arab states. As Tehran inches closer toacquiring nuclear weaponsand theAmerican footprintin the region continues to dwindle, there is an apparent sentiment that thebalance of poweris tipping toward Iran. As such, opening to Syria could serve as a way to undermine Iran. Tempting Assad with assistance and normalization could remove Damascus from the grasp of Tehran.
How the Biden Administration responds to normalization will have significant ramifications on the security environment of the Middle East. If Biden continues his de-facto passive approval for normalization or moves to embrace it openly, there is a chance Arab states could weaken Iran’s influence in Syria. Reports are circulating regarding apotential multilateral Arab dealwhereby regional states will recognize Assad, send billions of dollars of aid for Syrian reconstruction, and pressure the US and Europe to rescind the sanctions against Syria. In exchange, Assad will commit to meet several conditions, including his agreement to reduce the Iranian presence in Syrian territory. Weakened Iranian influence in Syria would be welcome news to Arab states who feel surrounded by Tehran and to the United States, whosetroops in Syriaface attacks fromIranian-backed militias.
However, normalization comes with immense humanitarian and security risks that could outweigh this benefit. First, normalizing Assad would prolong Syrian suffering.Syrian refugees have indicatedthey feel unsafe returning to Syria as long as Assad remains in power.Recentreportshave highlighted the abuses committed by Syrian security forces against returning refugees. The trend toward normalization showed nations werealready forcing refugees to return home. As normalization expands, the pressure to return refugees will grow throughout the region as states begin to believe the war in Syria is officially over.
Second, normalization with Assad would strengthen the position ofRussiain the region.Assad and Russia maintain close ties, with the former allowing the latter to have amilitary presencewithin its controlled territory. Normalization would ensure Russia could continue this presence for the foreseeable future, which poses a risk to Syrian civilians and American forces fighting ISIL. Russian soldiers in Syriahave reportedly committed multiple human rightsabuses against the civilian population andhave gotten into altercationswith American troops.
Third, normalization would reassert the presence and standing of ISIL.Assad has previously relied on ISILto help squash the Free Syrian Army opposition and for oil. As normalization offers his rule more legitimacy,he may continue to enable and facilitatethe continued survival of ISIL “in an effort to paint all of the Syrian opposition as ‘terrorists,’” allowing him to increase the territory he controls.
If Biden chooses to act, his likely move would be to leverage sanctions on nations that have or are beginning to normalize relations with Assad under the Caesar Act. While it may appear counterproductive to sanction allies,evidence shows that alliesare more susceptible to sanctions than rivals. For instance,Turkey buckled to American sanctions in 2018when the Trump Administration sanctioned its NATO ally for refusing to release an American prisoner. Since the United States is the largest weapon supplier toJordan,Saudi Arabia, andthe UAE, the Biden Administration could leverage the prospect of future weapon sales or parts needed for equipment maintenance. These states might then reconsider their relationship with Assad while others in the region think twice before risking the prospect of American sanctions.
Still, this policy choice is not a risk-free move for the Biden Administration. America’s allies in the Middle East have feared that the United States is no longer concerned with regional affairs. States likeSaudi Arabiaandthe UAEhave hedged towards China recently. Arab leaders might feel that, if slapped with American sanctions, the United States no longer has their best interest at heart. Potential sanctions might therefore be the blow that sways the Arab states from the American camp to the Chinese one, effectively installing Beijing as the Middle East’s new security architect. However, the Biden Administration might have to aggravate his regional allies in order for Assad to be held accountable for his crimes.

(Analysis) The Two Battles of Culiacan,"Professionalization, Tripartismo, Trasformismo
On 17 October 2019, a convoy of Mexican military and law enforcement personnel moved to surround the home of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of “El Chapo” in the city of Culiacan. Their objective was to arrest Guzman in order to enact a warrant issued by a U.S. judge. The Mexican Military successfully detained Guzman. Within minutes a region-wide cartel mobilization took place to prevent the exfiltration of the Mexican Military.
The Mexican military engaged cartel forces for several hours before finally releasing Guzman on the orders of President Lopez Obrador (AMLO) who qualified the decision as a choice taken to prevent the unnecessary loss of life. Regardless of the rationale behind the decision, the Sinaloa Cartel and their armed affiliates Gente Nueva (Los Chapitos) had effectively defeated the Mexican Military and deprived them of not only a major city (Culiacan) but an entire state (Sinaloa). For several hours it was apparent that the Federal authorities did not have the military force or political will necessary to confront organized crime. In addition, thefirst battle of Culiacanwas notorious for footage of cartel gunmen employing high-profile weaponry such as 12.7 mm anti-material rifles and rocket launchers as they contested the state’s control over the region of Sinaloa demonstrating that organized crime was a credible military threat.
The authorities in Mexico City responded to the immediate loss of Culiacan by ordering 8000 men to the region to restore order and the government’s monopoly of force. Despite the eventual restoration of order, Guzman remained free. Outlets such as theNY Timesoffered mixed interpretations, for many, this symbolized a country on the precipice of outright state collapse. Sensationalist headlines such as “Mexican Cartel Rules City After Gunbattle” from the Wall Street Journal captured the fears of international observers.
The First Battle of Culiacan came about during a larger process of reorganization best exemplified by the formation of the Mexican National Guard. Originally intended to replace the amalgamation of local, state, and federal police forces to streamline crime fighting, the National Guard has since occupied a larger role in duties related to illegal immigration as well as the fight against organized crime. It is possible to observe through the formation of the National Guard an effort to move towards a centralized response to organized crime in Mexico while simultaneously moving to diversify the armed bodies available due to long-standinghuman rightsconcerns related to theMexican Armyand Marines.
In early January of 2023 the Mexican military again successfully detained Ovidio Guzman. While the Sinaloa forces again triggered a wave of regional unrest and employed high-powered weaponry to engage military vehicles and helicopters, this time the Mexican authorities were able to transfer Guzman to a maximum security prison in Mexico City before going on to restore order in Sinaloa. The operation entailed the deployment of approximately 3,800 military personnel as opposed to the 8,000 used in 2019 to restore order. The results of the second operation hint at several more extensive processes that have transformed the Mexican Government’s struggle against organized crime, namely the professionalization of the National Guard and a process of transformism that has isolated organized crime from potential allies and intermediaries.
Professionalization
Through the two battles of Culiacan, it is possible to perceive both an evolving military logic and expertise within the Mexican Military and an increasingly national imagery used to demonstrate the primacy of the federal authorities in relation to the regional power centers of the Cartels.
In a counterinsurgency environment, there are two critical elements of command and control that any counterinsurgent force must seek to retain:unity of command and unity of effort. Unity of command allows for a single decision-making chain in the struggle to enforce the state’s role as the legitimate holder of the monopoly of force. Unity of effort meanwhile, is the struggle to extend tendrils of the counterinsurgent organization horizontally across society so that actors and agencies such as NGOs, local government, etc. work to promote programs and pursue objectives that are in line with the broader counterinsurgency.
In Mexico, before the formation of the Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection (2018) and the National Guard (2019), there were numerous organizations and agencies that had a possible nexus to the fight against organized crime. The first battle of Culiacan was an inglorious start to the professionalization of the counterinsurgent forces, but the principles established in that engagement; such as an emerging unity of command, had obvious merit when the second stroke of the Mexican government was able to successfully pacify Sinaloa.
Since the first battle of Culiacan, the National Guard has expanded in manpower and accrued experience in multiplemission setsthat often deviated from the stated goal of combating organized crime. Before the formation of the National Guard, theMexican Navy and Naval Infantryhad a reputation as a particularly effective tool in previous phases of the drug war.  This reputation likely motivated the belief that a militarized force was necessary as exemplified by AMLO’s statements regarding the standards ofmilitary disciplinehe wanted to see within the organization. In 2022 the National Guard became fullymilitarized.
Tripartismo
The current struggle against organized crime is a modern articulation of the same process as the formation of national identity in the post-revolutionary period. Historically the ruling political party the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR) and it’s later and longer lasting iteration the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) utilized a mixture of economic populism and national imagery to lay the foundation of an enduring model of governance that offered consistent growth in exchange for the curtailment of some economic rights as a result of gradual import-substitution industrialization. This economic model isTripartismo. It originated in the immediate post-revolutionary period and attempts to encapsulate all social conflict (between labor and capital) safely within the terrain of the Mexican State. For much of the 20th century, tripartismo did achieve stable and consistent growth. Tripartismo was one of the primary forces motivating the Mexican Economic Miracle (and lasted from 1940 – 1970) and came to define the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
This period saw a massive expansion of consumerism and allowed for increased government spending with large portions of the legal economy dominated by intermediaries between the state and private industry. Since NAFTA, Mexico has transitioned to a modernized form of import substitution industrialization that prioritizes integrated industrial production (such as the automotive industry) and regional economic-industrial development.
However, the economic development overseen the PRI was not without criticism. Periodic overt repression and a perception of a lack of credible elections are some of the motivating factors behind perspectives that highlighthistoric authoritarianismin Mexico. The most notable instance of overt repression was the 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre which had its roots in the global economic-political crisis of 1968. Despite some verifiable authoritarian tendencies, due to consistent growth and the increased provision of services, the era remains appealing to many and serves as an enduring point of reference in Mexican politics.
The modern Mexican economic model is a modernized version of tripartismo and the object of struggle between the Mexican State and Organized Crime is the right to occupy the third and defining position in the three-party formula. This third pole allows for a degree of stability that will facilitate managed development and entitles the arbitrating entity to a share of the profit and power guiding development. Both the Mexican State and Organized Crime have constructed governance models that provide tangible benefits for the Mexican population in an effort to secure their respective positions as the third pole of Mexican society.
Mexican Corporatism under the state seeks to utilize revenue from nationalization/mineral extraction (Lithium, historically petroleum) to fund wider industrial development with limited redistribution to guarantee social peace. This is observable in not only recentlithium nationalizationswhich has  been likened to the historic Petroleum Nationalization of President Cardenas by the Movimiento Regeneracion Nacional (MORENA) which is the party of President Obredor, but alsoregional industrialization planswhich seek to entice domestic and foreign capital to partner with state mechanisms to stimulate focused economic growth.
Mexican organized crime, insofar as it is possible to refer to it as a single entity, has a similar model of development that substitutes licit mineral extraction with illicit cultivation or transportation of narcotics. Organized crime is heavily integrated into the global illegal and semi-legal economy which gives criminal organizations access to world-class funding and resources. Whiledifferencesexist between major criminal organizations, the tendencies and general methods of rule are relatively similar. This demonstrates not only the comparative weakness of the Mexican state in select geographic areas but also highlights the extent to which the sentiments of the populace can becapturedby organized crime which operates through a governance model predicated on periodic remittances and controlled private development.
Trasformismo
the interplay between the State, Organized Crime, and the populace in Mexico is not unique. In a complex system of governance, the state engages with and is composed of many competing powers, entities, and blocs. Organized Crimehistoricallyis to be expected to have some relationship with the political establishment and at times can successfully subvert government to its own end, state capture. MORENA and organized crime are both seeking to carve out space from the other while in an active albeit unofficial dialogue throughinteraction. While many outlets and individuals allege direct connections or relationships, the existence or lack thereof is beside the point. MORENA as the ruling party of the Mexican State must engage in some degree of competition with organized crime as outlined above, it is possible to conceptualize this existing simultaneously as interaction and tacit influence through the historic concept of “Trasformismo“. Trasformismo in its typical context (Italy), is thought of as a mechanism by which revolution was forestalled by constructing a vast centrist coalition or through the selective neutralization of particular leaders and ideas that could lead to revolution. I would propose that instead, the endless small accommodations and delayed decisive conflict are the animating and critical component of trasformismo if divorced from its Italian context.
In Mexico, trasformismo is the endless struggle for the elimination of narco-violence even as organized crime expands operations and commands a growing degree of social influence. In exchange, as outlined by Angelica Duran-Martinez inThe Politics of Drug Violence: Criminals, Cops, and Politicians in Colombia and Mexico, organized crime often is motivated to conceal violence in exchange for relative peace. There areclaimsthat MORENA and the Sinaloa Cartel in Culiacan have a local quid pro quo agreement. If true, this minor agreement perfectly illustrates the endless noncommittal skirmish and tacit accommodation that characterizes Mexican Trasformismo which ground on after being momentarily interrupted in 2019.
In response to their defeat in Culiacan, the state was not idle. Delaying overt conflict, MORENA conducted several transformations within the military, political process, and economic sphere before committing to a decisive engagement in 2023. By isolating organized crime from the political opposition through trasformismo, MORENA simplified the conflict to a binary contest for control over Culiacan and the State of Sinaloa. As a result of the professionalization of the National Guard, the unification of command and control, and the isolation of Sinaloa through trasformismo operationally the Mexican military was able to achieve a resounding success. Like any successful operation, this does not decide the ultimate outcome of the fight for the third pole in Tripartismo or the future of Mexico and it will fall upon the government to exploit their success with future operations.
Securing Guzman and defeating the resulting unrest has provided the foundation for a degree of growing confidence and bellicosity which will likely increase as MORENA successfully approaches cementing its role in a new tripartismo.
Conclusion:
The two battles of Culiacan provide a window to observe the ongoing struggle for which entity constitutes the third pole in Tripartismo, the Mexican State or organized crime. Both pursue similar models of development with notable differences including licit or illicit foreign capital providing the foundation for a continuing import substitution model of development. Both entities provide services and extract taxes of one form or another from the Mexican people and both are seemingly cognizant of the need to demonstrate that they are a superior option with public order as the main avenue.
The Mexican State under MORENA has successfully endeavored to isolate specifically the Sinaloa Cartel from the political opposition through trasformismo. While there remains a degree of deniability, it is possible to utilize the second battle of Culiacan as evidence itself. The maneuvering of MORENA has ensured that in the actual struggle there is a binary of choices, Mexico or Sinaloa, and the national imagery used after the successful conclusion of the battle demonstrates that this is as much an ideological victory as a martial one.
In addition, untilrecentlyMexico has successfully consolidated agencies under the Mexican military in order to provide for the professionalization of the National Guard and the simplification of the anti-organized crime efforts. This has provided the Mexican government with all of the tools to wage a successful campaign against the Sinaloa Cartel. While organized crime will persist and it will remain a dynamic operating environment, the Mexican State has in the short term demonstrated to the citizens of Mexico that it remains, for now, the only possible third pole in Tripartismo.

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: The G7 Summit vs China-Central Asia Summit: A New Group Confrontation?,"The Group of Seven (G7) summit came to an end in Hiroshima, Japan. The lightningappearance of Ukrainian President Zelenskydrew global attention to the G7’s determination to unite in support of Ukraine against Russia; the invitation extended to eight countries — India, Indonesia, the Cook Islands, Morocco, Brazil, Vietnam, Australia, and South Korea — to convene an expanded meeting seemed to demonstrate the G7’s international mobilisation.
President Zelensky had met with leaders from the UK, India, France, Canada, and the US. In addition, Zelensky met with G7 leaders and expressed his hope that they would increase military aid to Ukraine. For the first time, the US approved the dispatch ofF-16 fighter jetsto Kyiv. This was a major victory for Zelensky, as he had been lobbying for months for advanced fighter jets, and the F-16 is now the leading fighter jet in the military field. The expanded meeting was designed to allow the countries of the Global South to support the G7 position on the Russo-Ukrainian war and present a united international front; however, India, Brazil, Indonesia, etc.,did not change their stancejust because they attended the G7 summit.
Another focus of the G7 summit was China. On Saturday, the seven leaders issued a joint document entitled “Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament,” which called out China’s lack of transparency in its nuclear weapons development and expressed concern about peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and human rights issues in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The Joint Statement also stressed the need for member states to resist economic coercion from China. US President Joe Biden said at a press conference that member states had reached a consensus on China: G7 countries must develop the capacity to withstand economic coercion, and there is a need to limit certain advanced technologies that could threaten national security without unduly restricting trade and investment. The statement immediately sparked strong protests in Beijing. The Chinese Foreign Ministryrespondedthat “the G7 ignored China’s serious concerns and persisted in manipulating China-related issues, searing and attacking China, and violently interfering with China’s internal affairs,” and that the international community would not accept the G7 Summit statement.
Against the backdrop of the negative portrayal of Beijing as a “threat” at the G7 Summit,the first China-Central Asia Summit, which opened on May 18, is part of a regional integration process aimed at preserving a region. The leaders of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan pledged to support Beijing and deepen bilateral relations, with the Chinese media hailing the summit as a triumph of Chinese regional diplomacy. The China-Central Asia Summit offers Beijing a chance to showcase its “deep friendship” with Central Asia as China seeks to expand its international influence amid the protracted Russo-Ukrainian war, intensifying competition between the US and China, and the West’ estrangement from China.
However, Western geo-political strategists have long considered China’s diplomatic behaviour in Central Asia to be contested by the great powers of Eurasia. Many Western commentators still view the Summit through the lens of the great powers competing for a sphere of influence during the Cold War era, seeing it as China’s success in “fighting for Russia’s backyard.” This is a wrong perception and should be interpreted the other way around. The Summit reflects that China and Russia have reached a high level of political mutual trust and have reached a consensus on stabilising the Central Asian region.","June 13, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-g7-summit-vs-china-central-asia-summit-a-new-group-confrontation/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,NewsRoom
A Western Misunderstanding of Macron’s EU Strategic Autonomy,"On April 9th French newspaper Les Echos and political news websitePOLITICOboth published an interview with French President Emmanuel Macron on his presidential plane as he flew from Beijing to Guangzhou during his visit to China. In this interview, Macron declared that “accelerating evolution on the Taiwan issue” is not in Europe’s interest. He warned that Europe should not become a “follower” of the “US rhythm” and “China’s overreaction” on the Taiwan issue, but instead argued that Europe must have its own strategy, whether in Ukraine, relations with China and sanctions, and reiterated that Europe should ensure its own economic resources and should not rely on the “extraterritorial power of the US dollar.”
Saddled with the “Gaullism” that advocates Europe’s independence from the United States, Macron put forward the idea of European strategic autonomy in aspeechat Sorbonne University in 2017. After the shocks of Trump’s rise to power, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russo-Ukrainian war, Macron believes the time is ripe for such a strategic approach on the continent. In the face of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war and the threat of protectionism in the United States, represented by the Inflation Reduction Act, Macron believes that the next step in accelerating European autonomy will be to accelerate the implementation of Europe’s military, technological, energy and financial plans.
The conversation between Macron and Xi repeatedly revealed a consensus between the two leaders in their quest for a multipolar world after the era of US hegemony. To break away from dependence on the United States, Macron sees Europe first unifying its patchwork of national defence standards and building up its own defence industry and second accelerating the development of nuclear and renewable energy in Europe so that it does not have to rely on fossil fuel supplies from other countries. In international politics, Europe should also remove the “camp confrontation logic”, implement “de-risk”, not rely on others, and maintain as strong an integration of its own value chain as possible. And finally, of course, reducing reliance on the US dollar.
Controversy over Macron’s EU strategic autonomy
However, Macron’s speech on the EU’s strategic autonomy is controversial inside the EU and the West in general. After the interview was published, a number of Twitter usersretweeteda parody of the word Macroning, explaining that it meant “deliberately increasing dependence on China whilst lecturing European partners about naïvety and the need to boost the EU’s strategic autonomy.” Sari Arho Havren, an adviser at the Finnish embassy in Belgium, criticized Macron’s speech as unfortunate. “Macron had no mandate to speak on behalf of the whole EU, and EU doesn’t ‘need China more than ever,’ it’s France (and GER) who do not represent the rest of Europe.”
US Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that “after his 6-hour meeting in China he told reporters that Europe should create distance with the US & should not get involved in supporting America over China when it comes to Taiwan.” Rubio stressed that if Macron represents Europe and believes it should not choose sides between the United States and China on the Taiwan issue, the United States can leave Europe to deal with Russia alone. He went on to pointed to Beijing’s support for Macron’s remarks and asked France or Europe to respond as soon as possible.
However, even Germany disagrees with Macron’s speech. Speaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on May 9, German Chancellor Angela Scholz called for more global cooperation on equal terms rather than striving to turn the EU into a third pole alongside the United States and China. “Those who still yearn for the dream of European power, who serve the illusion of power, are stuck in the past,” he said. Europe should “abandon the Eurocentric view of the past few decades.”
Macron’s government has had to adjust its rhetoric in the face of an onslaught from Western media and politicians. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings that France and Europe wanted to pursue a policy course independent of the United States and China but intended to be a “strong and reliable ally of the United States.” He stressed that Paris and Washington had coordinated their positions on China ahead of Macron’s visit.
As Le Maire said, many misinterpretate Macron’s idea about the strategic autonomy of the EU. When he discusses strategic autonomy, he is not just talking about its’ autonomy towards the US but also its autonomy towards China as well. For China, the idea of European strategic autonomy means that Europe will not blindly follow US policy and join its Allies in suppressing China. From this perspective, European autonomy is a pursuit that deserves China’s support in word and deed. But from another point of view, an autonomous Europe does not mean the continent will not adopt unfavourable policies to China and its own interests.
The EU as a Balancer between the U.S. and China?
Leaving aside the European Parliament’s often negative political statements on China’s various human rights conditions, Macron can also be regarded as a European “anti-China pioneer” in terms of substantive policy. As China’s auto exports have just overtaken Japan to become the largest exporter, its new energy vehicle exports increased by 90% in the first quarter compared with last year. Europe, which has been the auto industry leader, immediately felt uneasy, and began to worry that China’s role in the era of new energy vehicles will threaten the European auto industry in other markets around the world, and even the European market itself.
In a speech in May, Macron said: We cannot repeat the mistakes of solar panels in the electric vehicle market– we have created here a dependence on Chinese industry, allowing (Chinese) manufacturers to flourish. In terms of international trade, Macron’s “European strategic autonomy” is not much different from the protectionism of the Biden administration’s chip bill and climate bill, and it is also about national security and geopolitics trumping pure economic logic and using industrial policy to protect or rebuild its own specific industries.
The widespread misunderstanding of Macron’s position on EU strategic autonomy is precisely because this idea of strategic autonomy wants to counter the popularity of the “American-Sino bipolar mentality.” A mindset that was on display during Macron’s visit to China with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are leading advocates of EU strategic autonomy.
On the issue of Taiwan, if we examine Macron’s remarks, he does not mean that the Taiwan issue itself does not involve Europe’s interests, but that the “accelerated evolution of the Taiwan issue” promoted by the US, such as Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and McCarthy’s meeting with Tsai Ing-wen, does not serve EU’s interest. He does not mean that if there is a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, it will be a crisis that does not belong to Europe, but that the strategic deployment of whether the EU should intervene and how to intervene should not be dominated by the will of the US or China, and the EU should not be passively involved in the crisis.

"The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: Beijing’s First Counterattack, What’s Next?","The Ministry of Commerce of China and the General Administration of Customs issued anoticeon the evening of July 3rd, in accordance with the relevant provisions of theExport Control Law of the PRC, theForeign Trade Law of the PRC, and theCustoms Law of the PRC, in order to safeguard national security and interests, and with the approval of the State Council of the PRC, decided to implement export control on gallium and germanium-related items. Items that meet the relevant characteristics shall not be exported without permission. The announcement will come into effect on August 1, 2023.
Gallium and germanium are metals that are necessary components for the semiconductor industry. These chips can be used in high-power, high-frequency, and high-voltage environments, making these wafers suitable for a range of demanding applications. Thus, making chips is at the core of the US-China tech war.
Although the technology for mining, refining and manufacturing gallium and germanium is not unique to China, due to the complex production process, China has complete production lines and facilities, which can significantly reduce costs, so it has become a major global supplier. According to the Critical Raw Materials Alliance, about 80 per cent of the world’s gallium and 60 per cent of germanium are produced in China.
The US is not helpless in the face of China’s retaliation. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal on July 4, the US government mayrequireAmazon, Microsoft, and other US cloud service providers to obtain permission from the US government before providing cloud computing services using advanced AI chips to Chinese companies. The US is also considering restricting the activities of Chinese cloud service providers, such as Alibaba and Tencent, in the US.
According to the report, the restriction on cloud computing is actually to fill the “loophole” in the Biden administration’s policy of restricting the export of chip equipment. Because Chinese AI companies use U.S. cloud services to get around current export control rules. The report quoted national security analysts as warning that Chinese AI companies that want to use advanced chips can get them from any cloud provider in the US without having to buy chips directly. China is the upstream for many products’ raw materials, and it is foreseeable that China will add more rare metals and even active pharmaceutical ingredients.
When one country’s dependence on another in any respect becomes a risk, de-risking is no different from decoupling.","July 19, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-new-normal-la-nouvelle-normalite-%e6%96%b0%e5%b8%b8%e6%85%8b-beijings-first-counterattack-whats-next/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,NewsRoom
Deaths Of Despair: A Silent Interconnected Health Challenge In Europe,"The COVID-19 pandemic, apart from one of the most severe pandemics in recent times, exacerbated existing deficiencies within our societies and widened the gaps in healthcare systems. As for what accounts for mental health,studieshave shown a global aggravation of depression and anxiety, following the beginning of the COVID-19 emergency. This is paired up with a rise in drug overdose and the idea of suicide in the population. These factors contribute to the development of what’s known as “deaths of despair”.
A “death of despair” is the outcome of what’s known as “disease of despair”. This kind of disease responds to three types of behaviour-related medical conditionsuffered by people who experience despair due to long-term socioeconomic reasons. These diseases are drug overdose, suicide, and alcoholic liver disease. The despair can be experienced infour different ways: cognitive (thoughts of defeat, pessimism), emotional (sadness, loneliness, apathy),  behavioural (reckless or self-destructive behaviour) and biological (dysregulation of the body’s stress reactive system).
The contributing factors for developing a disease of despair can be varied and not necessarily tied to economic conditions. However,research outcomesexplain that social connections, level of education, medical condition, working opportunities or perception of one’s own future could play a contributing role.
Deaths of despair pose a significant threat to society, especially if attention is paid to the recent data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). In theEuropean Drug Report 2023, published recently, the EMCDDA identified that the mortality rate due to drug overdoses in the European Union (EU) in 2021 was estimated at 18.3 deaths per million population aged 15 to 64. Opioids, including heroin and its metabolites, were present in about three-quarters of the reported fatal overdoses in the EU. The number of overdose deaths among those aged 50 to 64 has grown significantly since 2012, with a 69% increase between 2012 and 2021.
When having a look into the substances, methadone, often combined with other opioids, alcohol, or benzodiazepines, was involved in a considerable number of drug-induced deaths in several EU countries. Stimulants, particularly amphetamines and methamphetamines, were also frequently involved in many deaths. As for heroin, there is a significant variation  with higher proportions reported in countries like Austria, Italy, Ireland, Poland, and Romania.
According to the EMCCDA, the situation in Europe shows a diversified market, with high availability of illicit drugs and a wider range of options with higher potency or purity. This increased diversity in the drug offer exposes consumers to substances with limited knowledge regarding health risks or chemical composition. Nevertheless, this situation not only endangers public health but also poses a significant threat from the regulatory perspective since they might fall into legal loopholes and gaps in definitions of more traditional drugs.
Due to the interconnection between drug abuse and other mental health issues, this data only confirms the worrying trend of deaths of despair, which are on the rise. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the multi-crisis affecting Europe, the war in Ukraine and the inflationary phenomenon have severely affected the population that was already in distress before the pandemic hits. The EMCDDA’s report also confirms that cohort studies revealed a much higher overall mortality risk among people who use drugs, with excess mortality  being 17 times higher than the general population. Benzodiazepines, a well-known drug for treating insomnia, anxiety or depression, are now also a common drug responsible for overdose deaths in several countries.
As a response to the urgent deterioration of the mental health of EU citizens, the European Commission published its “comprehensive approach to mental health” on 7 June 2023. This initiative aimed to lay the foundation for a holistic approach to mental health through three guiding principles: adequate and effective prevention, access to high quality and affordable mental healthcare and treatment and reintegration into society after recovery. Moreover, a plan with 20 flagship initiatives was also presented that includes a “mental health in all policies” approach along with other actions such as the creation of a European Code for Mental Health. Furthermore, the strategy places a strong emphasis on prevention and improving access to care and treatment.
However, despite the existing connection between mental health and substance abuse, the official communication offers a minimal link of these two phenomenons. The strategy briefly mentions that “The special care needs of people with comorbidities should also be addressed to facilitate access to effective treatments, in particular for people with drug-use disorders, in line with the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025 and the related Action Plan”. This statement outlines the possibility of comorbidities, which in a mental health context refers to coexisting disorders, but does not provide an in-depth analysis as to the circumstances that prompt people to such states. Consequently, it isolates mental health disorders and does not acknowledge their impact in substance abuse patients nor considers other contriubting factors outlined above, such as socioeconomic conditions or hopelesness.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the following crises that Europe has had to face have brought to light the pressing need to address mental health issues and the concerning diseases of despair. Data from the European Drug Report 2023 only confirms the worrying trends in drug overdoses and mental health problems, highlighting the interconnected nature of these issues. While the European Commission’s initiative for a holistic approach to mental health is a step in the right direction, with its focus on prevention and access to high-quality care, it is nonetheless crucial to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of these issues and recognize the various socioeconomic contributing factors.
Mental health and drug abuse are intricately linked, with a two-sided relationship. Individuals dealing with mental health issues are often more susceptible to developing drug or alcohol disorders. Conversely, those struggling with drug use regularly face additional challenges such as unemployment, homelessness, and lack of access to healthcare, which can exacerbate their mental health difficulties. This interconnection underscores the importance of addressing both mental health and substance abuse issues in a holistic and integrated manner, recognizing that effective treatment and support must consider the complex interplay between these two aspects of individuals’ well-being.
Future effortsshould emphasize a more inclusive and nuanced approach that addresses these root causes and provides tailored care to vulnerable populations. This could include long-term policy approaches to employment, education, and social infrastructures while providing short- and medium-term solutions that can ease the lives of people that already find themselves in these circumstances.
What will be the long-term consequences on mental health from the current crisis?
Will the comprehensive approach to mental health lead to tangible improvements?
What best practices can society implement in the meantime?

Chile’s National Lithium Strategy: Balancing Sustainable Resource Management And Economic Growth,"Chile, a country known for its abundant lithium reserves, has recently announced anew national strategyto maximize the potential of this valuable mineral resource. Led by President Gabriel Boric, the initiative aims to transform Chile into a key player in the battery industry and support the transition to green energy. The goal of expanding the national industry by prospecting new areas of the country that have not yet been targeted by mining projects is undoubtedly an ambitious plan. However, public opinion as well as part of the political class believe that this ambitious project could pave the way for the nationalization of the lithium industry, raising doubts about the participation of the private sector and the economic and social implications of such a move.
Nowadays, lithium has become an essential component in battery production; powering the growing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage. According to forecasts, global lithium demand isexpected to significantly increasein the next decade, from the current 500,000 metric tons to over 2 million metric tons by 2030. Therefore, lithium will continue to play an increasingly important role for the Chilean economy and society. Chile is home to the world’sthird-largest lithium reserve, with an estimated quantity of around 9.5 million metric tons. This currently positions the country as one of the top global lithium producers with an annual production exceeding 100,000 metric tons.
Chile’s lithium mining sector has experienced substantial development, mainly due to market-friendly policies adopted in the last 40 years. This has attracted significant foreign direct investments over the years, contributing to the modernization of extraction operations and the promotion of technological innovation. However, this has not led to significant diversification of the country’s economy. Economic growth remainsheavily reliant on the extractive sector, and exports are mainly concentrated in natural resource-based and primary products. From a social perspective, Chile faces challenges related to the inequitable distribution of economic benefits derived from the mining industry. Recent data shows that around10% of the Chilean population lives in poverty, and the access to economic benefits related to the expansion of lithium extraction processes may not be evenly distributed in the future, further widening existing socioeconomic inequalities.
From an environmental standpoint, the extraction of lithium from brine operations, if not properly managed, can havesevere consequences on the surrounding ecosystem. Lithium extraction practices require intensive use of water resources and can lead to a reduction in local water reserves. In particular, lithium extraction in Chile currently takes place exclusively in the Atacama region, which is an extremely arid territory. The lack of rainfall and scarcity of water resources have resulted in significant environmental impacts from lithium extraction, threatening local communities that depend on these resources for survival. In recent years, this has fueledresistance and social conflictsfrom surrounding indigenous communities, who have demonstrated by blocking access to extraction sites.
The National Lithium Strategyannouncedin April by President Gabriel Boric was formally detailed in a33-page documentreleased in mid-June. The strategy is based on several key components to ensure greater state control over Chile’s lithium industry, primarily through the creation of a state lithium mining company. As a result, the role of the state in new operations will undoubtedly be more prominent. The government will be allowed to directly manage some extraction operations or establish partnerships with private companies when it comes to the allocation of new extraction contracts. This will translate into increased involvement of the public sector in lithium production, starting in the first half of 2024, when the government is expected to grant new mining permits to private companies.
Furthermore, the strategy aims to respect existing contracts with companies already operating in the sector, such as SQM and Albemarle. At the same time, by involving the state-owned copper company Codelco and the state mining company ENAMI, the government intends to renegotiate these contracts, particularly to ensure greater state participation and profit sharing from extraction activities. Another key component of the strategy is the identification of new lithium extraction areas in the country. Chile has identified over 18 salt flats, which are areas with lithium-rich salt deposits, where extraction could be developed. According to the official document, this will contribute to diversifying lithium production in the country and maximizing its vast reserves.
Additionally, the strategy aims to promote the creation of a stronger local value chain in the lithium sector. This means encouraging the production of value-added lithium batteries and components within the country, rather than simply exporting raw mineral. This should foster the development of local skills, employment, and economic growth. An important aspect of the strategy is also to ensure rigorous environmental standards for lithium extraction and processing. Chile will seek to adopt sustainable technologies and practices to reduce the environmental impact of the lithium industry and protect local ecosystems, particularly in areas adjacent to extraction projects.
The lithium strategy promoted by Boric represents a significant commitment to maximizing the benefits derived from this strategic resource for Chile. It aims to create a balance between public and private interests, ensuring sustainable management of lithium resources, profit sharing, and socio-economic development of the country. The effective implementation of this strategy will be crucial to guarantee efficient, responsible lithium production that aligns with the growing global demand.
The new Chilean lithium strategy presents potential challenges that require careful attention. One key challenge is the growing global demand for lithium and the country’s ability to maintain a stable supply. Currently, as outlined, production is primarily controlled by two companies, SQM and Albemarle, operating in a single region, the Salar de Atacama. However, in order to keep up with the demand and ensure a consistent supply to the market, Chile needs to attract new companies willing to operate in the territory. This can only be achieved by reassuring and convincing existing and potential investors through large-scale public investments in the form of tax incentives and other measures aimed at creating a favorable investment environment. At the same time, maximizing lithium reserves is not enough. Expansion must be carried out with a careful consideration for the environment. The strategy itself, for example, explicitly acknowledges territorial and environmental concerns, including a plan to conserve 30% of the Salar de Atacama region. The involvement of new companies in lithium extraction is certainly a factor that puts the promised sustainable approach by the government at risk. In this case as well, it will be important to adopt robust environmental standards that are capable of not discouraging new actors from entering the sector.
The country, therefore, faces a historic opportunity to achieve significant growth in the lithium sector through a public-private partnership. Despite the high quality and low price of lithium, the Chilean lithium sector has lost significant market share in recent years. The new strategy represents a crucial opportunity for the country to regain high competitiveness in the lithium market while demonstrating that this can be done while protecting the environment and local communities.

(Analysis) The EU’s Evolving China Strategy in a Turbulent Global Landscape,"The EU-China relations have reached a new milestone of mistrust, disagreements, and caution,particularly since the Russian invasion of Ukrainebegan. Navigating the complex relationship between the EU and Chinahas always been challenging. Given the intricate nature of the EU and the decision-making process involved, establishing a coherent China policy has consistently sparked debates. The concerns related tohuman rights also significantly shape the EU’s stance towards China, limiting the possibility of expanding relations. On the one hand, the rise of China necessitates finding common ground and paying considerable attention to relations with Beijing. On the other hand, the EU finds itself in a predicament due toChina’s ambitions to challenge the position of the US within the international systemand the rules-based order created by the West.
The EU’s policy towards China faces a threefold challenge. Firstly, the EU’s normative power position andcommitment to safeguarding and promoting democracy, human rights, and other fundamental freedomshinder closer relations with China. Secondly, while the EU has always been open to mutually beneficial cooperation with China regarding shared interests,China’s aim to reshape what it perceives as an unjust and discriminatory international orderdoes not align with the Union’s interests. Lastly, thetransatlantic bonds between Brussels and Washington further complicate the bilateral agenda between the EU and China, especially concerning various foreign policy, trade and security issues.
China’s promotion of a new vision of global governancethrough its institutions challenges the concept of effective multilateralism and the liberal order. The intensifying competition between the United States and China,China’s growing influence in the Global South, and ever-increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region are compelling the EU to reassess its China policy. Consequently, the EU faces crucial questions: How should the EU engage with Beijing to minimize the risks associated with China’s rise? Should the EU align entirely with the US on China? Which policy approach should the EU adopt: de-risking or even decoupling? It is, therefore, crucial to analyze the place of China in the EU’s strategic documents and provide a brief overview of the relations between them. Subsequently, it is essential to delve into the discussions surrounding the EU’s future Chinese policy and the recalibration of the current policy as a response to theRussian invasion and China’s ambivalent stance.
Understanding the Institutional Dynamics in EU-China Relations
The European Union and China have institutionalized their relations through various mechanisms.The EU and China regularly hold summitsto discuss and coordinate their bilateral ties. These summits provide a platform for high-level dialogue and the exchange of political, economic, and strategic views. The agenda depends on the global geopolitical situation and the internal situations in both the EU and China. These summits have alsobecome a platform for the two sides to draw red lines and voice their positions on various issues. In addition to the summits, the EU and China have establishedHigh-Level Strategic Dialogue, which involves meetings between senior officials from both sides, typically at the ministerial level or above. These meetings allow both sides to exchange views, deepen mutual understanding, and explore avenues for collaboration. The dialogue covers many topics, including foreign policy, security, trade, investment, climate change, and other areas.
The year 2003 was crucial for EU-China relations for several reasons. A significant development was the creation of theEU-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which deepened and broadened cooperation. Another important milestone was adopting theEU’s security strategy, the guiding framework for the EU’s foreign and security policies in the 21st century. At that time, the EU’s engagement with China was dominated by liberal and idealistic views, influenced by the post-Cold War realities of the world. The EU’s desire, as stated in the2003 ‘European Security Strategy: A Secure Europe in a Better World,’was to make China a more open, reliable, and responsible partner. The EU was eager to support China’s development and transformation as it would allow it to jointly address major challenges such as climate change, security, and migration. The EU welcomed Beijing’s push forassuming greater responsibility in world affairs. Fairtrade and economic competition were the cornerstones of mutually beneficial relations between the EU and China. However, the EU’s perspective at that time was naive, considering the prosperity and peace enjoyed in Europe after a century of instability and conflicts in the 20th century. The European Security Strategy suggested that spreading the rule of law and democracy was invaluable in transforming authoritarian regimes, subsequently bringing security and stability.
In 2013, the EU and China jointly adopted theEU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperationto strengthen their strategic partnership. This agenda aimed to be implemented through various mechanisms, including the annual Summit facilitated by the yearly High-Level Strategic Dialogue, High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue, and the bi-annual People-to-People Dialogue. The EU and China reiterated their shared responsibility as key actors in a multipolar global landscape to promote peace, prosperity, and sustainable development. They committed to strengthening their strategic partnership based on equality, respect, and trust.
In 2016, in response to various events that had shaken Europe, such as terrorist attacks, the migration and refugee crisis, instability in the EU’s neighbours, and the UK’s departure from the EU, several important documents were released addressing the relations between Brussels and Beijing.The 2016 Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliamentreaffirmed that democracy, human rights, and promoting shared values remained fundamental EU policy tenets and central to bilateral relations with China. The EU expressed its support for developing a full, healthy, and independent civil society in China and efforts to strengthen the rule of law. The EU declared its commitment to effective multilateralism while acknowledging the value divergence. Human rights discourse played a crucial role in the EU’s relations with Beijing, as it served as a “balancer” to avoid going too far in dealing with China. The EU’s stance on fundamental freedoms and its identity as a champion of human rights was an integral part of its soft power. Deviating from this approach would damage the EU’s image.
In this respect, it was acknowledged that the EU and China had different levels of ambition, and their views on global governance, the international system, trade, and the economy did not always align.The 2016 EU Global Strategyemphasized the importance of enhancing economic diplomacy and the security role in Asia for European prosperity. The EU aimed to engage China with respect for the rule of law, pursue a coordinated approach to China’s westward connectivity efforts, and seek fair competition, intellectual property rights, technology cooperation, and discussions on economic reform, human rights, and climate action.
In March 2019 the EU published a document titled‘EU-China – A strategic outlook,’which reflected a change in the EU’s perception of China. The document reiterated the need for cooperation with Beijing based on shared interests. It highlighted the strategic importance of China, emphasizing that the EU and China were two of the three largest economies and traders in the world. The EU mentioned that China could no longer be regarded as a developing country but as a key global actor and leading technological power. With China’s increasing presence in the world, including in Europe, the EU called for greater responsibilities from China in upholding the rules-based international order and greater reciprocity, non-discrimination, and openness in its system. The EU acknowledged that China was simultaneously a cooperation partner, a negotiating partner, an economic competitor, and a systemic rival in different policy areas.
Human Rights Violations, Deteriorating Relations and the Russian Invasion
As the relationship between the European Union and China became more complicated, increasing tensions and subsequent events highlighted the challenges and intricacies of their evolving dynamics. Firstly,the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemichad impacted relations negatively. Discussions were held regarding the virus’s origin, transparency, and vaccine access. The EU member states called for an unbiased investigation into the virus’s origin andaccused China of disinformation. Besides that, in 2019, the EU and China alsoconcluded in principle negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). Still, the growing violations of human rights by China in Xinjiang and China’s assault on freedoms in Hong Kong led to a significant deterioration between the EU and China.The EU introduced sanctions against Chinese officials and entitiesresponsible for violating human rights. It led to the freezing of agreement ratification. In this respect, the protection of human rights again determined and impacted the relations. The CAI had not been ratified also under the criticism and pressure of the United States.
That is why 2019 was a tipping point for the EU’s frustration over China. Brussels also realized that, indeed, both the EU and China are important to each other, but still, they have different priorities and geopolitical goals. As stated earlier, it was in 2019 that the EU labelled China as a systemic rival. The EU hoped China would conduct market reform, but that was different. Between 2019 and 2020, facing a hostile geopolitical environment in the context of the pandemic andbearing in mind frictions in transatlantic relations and Donald Trump’s administration, the EU realized that it has to have sufficient capabilities to be able to act on its own.That is why the discourse on strategic autonomy has been revitalized, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine only strengthened the impetusand sparked discussion on the EU’s actorness as a security and defence actor.
With the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,the need to rethink the EU’s relations with China arose further. Russia’s brutal war of aggression cast doubts over Beijing’s position regarding Moscow, leading to an increasingly negative image of China in the EU. EU officials had high expectations thatChina would use its influence to shape and influence Kremlin’s decision. They also voiced that due to China’s growing international role and its responsibilities, Beijing should do everything in its power to make Vladimir Putin halt the war. For instance, in April 2023,Josep Borrel, the EU’s HR/VP for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said that countries, particularly the powerful ones, should uphold and strengthen the rules-based international order.China, being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has expressed its commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and border integrity. Considering its significant economic ties with the European Union and Ukraine, it would be reasonable for China to leverage its positive relationship with Russia to encourage President Putin to pursue a peaceful and lawful course. He also stressed that there are no indications of such efforts.
The EU and its US counterparts continued exerting pressure on China to use its influence to stop Russia’s war. After a year of ambiguity,China decided to present what was called a “peace plan”in various media. This12-point documentwas China’s position, not a detailed plan with a precise sequence of steps that parties should follow to reach peace. The publication of this document further contributed to the negative image of Beijing. While the document indeed mentioned support for territorial integrity, on the other hand, it blurred the roles of the warring parties, henceblurring the roles of victims and aggressors. The document also calls to stop unilateral sanctions, which shows that Beijing is sensitive to any sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, contributing to the hostile image of China. This is exactly how the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described the Chinese document, adding that it is selective and does not consider Russia an aggressor state, using the language of twisted international law. Therefore, for the EU, there have only doubled doubts over China,stating that China’s declared neutrality is essentially pro-Russian. China’s zero-limits friendship with Russia declared before the invasion and Beijing’s continuing act of profiting from the war in Ukraine by purchasing Russia’s oil, gas, and other products at significantly reduced prices leaves no place for a positive image of China. Finally, the authoritarian threat posed by China puts it in the same boat as the Kremlin. Negative perceptions of China from the EU’s side are reinforced against China’s aggressive manoeuvres in the Indo-Pacific and threatening moves concerning Taiwan.
Debates on the EU’s New China Strategy
Based on the tense relations with China, turbulent international conjuncture, and Russia’s war against Ukraine, the EU is thought to re-evaluate its stance on China.While the EU is systematically undergoing the process of decoupling from Russian influence, which poses an immediate threat to peace and security, Brussels is significantly reducing the Union’s dependence on Russian energy. The case of China is still different. China’s growing influence on the international system has significantly threatened Europe’s economic stability, political autonomy, core values, interests, and security. This challenge is not limited to confrontations but extends to the broader impact of China’s actions on the global stage. As such, Europe must take proactive measures to safeguard its sovereignty and protect its interests in the face of this threat. Recently,a three-hour debate took place in the European Parliament, focusing on the need for a new, coherent strategy for EU-China relations.Numerous MEPs supported the idea that Brussels has to recalibrate its policy regarding China and that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has opened the eyes of Europeans to the evolving cooperation between Beijing and Moscow and their threatening influence on democracy.
It is also pertinent to note the statements made by various groups and MEPs on China. For instance,Manfred Weber, MEP, Chairman of the EPP, emphasized the need for a distinct European policy towards China alongside democratic partners worldwide. Weber stated that Europe possesses the necessary instruments, particularly in security and defence, but requires unified political will from Member States. The EPP Group also reiterated support for Taiwan and highlighted two red lines: no arming of Russia and no invasion of Taiwan. Radosław Sikorski MEP commented that the EU’s approach to China is based on cooperation, competition, and confrontation, with a clear commitment to supporting the United States in case of a Chinese attack.The Renew Europe Group in the European Parliament reiterated the need for a new strategy for China, emphasizing dialogue on global challenges like climate change while expressing concerns about human rights violations. They highlighted the importance of maintaining essential ties with Beijing while defending European values and seeking an equal partnership. The group emphasized the need for unity and resilience against China’s divisive tactics and reducing dependencies. The trade relationship with China should be based on rules and reciprocity. The group emphasized the importance of strengthening partnerships with like-minded allies. These statements are vital to demonstrating that China is an important partner, but there are issues where the EU cannot make any concessions, including human rights and security.
In Europe, however,there are two distinct and often opposing approaches towards dealing with China. Firstly, there is a push to strengthen economic ties. But on the other hand, there is growing concern over the risks of becoming too dependent on China, security concerns in the Asia Pacific region, China’s approach to governance, and its views on human rights. There seem to bedifferent approaches to China from the Member States and the EU. It was traceable during Emmanuel Macron’s and Olaf Scholz’s “business visits” with representatives of respective companies to Beijing and the visit of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who chose to maintain a cold tone in its communication with Beijing. It could be strange for someone, but for those who observe the level of unity within the EU, it is not. It is difficult to find common ground because the Member States have their foreign policies and visions of bilateral relations with China, ambitions, and strategies that might contradict a common European strategy, and the cases of France and Germany are notable in this respect. Berlin has even already publishedits new China strategy.
Defining proper China policy is tricky because of thehigh level of interdependence between Brussels and Beijing. Besides that, external factors limit the possibilities of enhancing relations with China, such as US-China rivalry. Seeking strategic autonomy is also seen differently in the US: for some observers, it is a way for Europe to do more in terms of its security, but on the other hand, it is conducting foreign policy that would not always align with the US.Recent interview by Macron, who doubted the need to fight alongside Washington over Taiwan, are a perfect example that is perhaps silently supported by many European leaders. This shows thatthe EU has different priorities than the United States in its relations with Chinaand its engagement in the Indo-Pacific. The EU’s new approach towards China will take a careful middle-ground approach, reflecting its dedication to protecting human rights and democratic values. Rather than completely severing ties, the updated policy will likely aim to minimize risks. As the partnership between the two sides is crucial, maintaining a positive relationship with China will remain a top priority for the EU. However, it is visible that China’s potential role in the Russian-Ukrainian war will be decisive for certain aspects of a newly crafted strategy and on how far the EU could go.

Bolsonaro Deemed Ineligible for Elections: Electoral Court Delivers 8-Year Setback,"On June 30th, Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court overwhelmingly voted in favor of rendering Former President Jair Bolsonaro ineligible to run for public office for a period of 8 years. This effectively means that Mr. Bolsonaro will be barred from contesting for public office in the 2024 and 2028 municipal elections and the 2026 general elections in Brazil, effectively reducing him to a ceremonial role for his Liberal Party and the right-wing in Brazil.
Incidentally, Bolsonaro is not the first former President of Brazil to be barred from contesting future elections. Former President Fernando Collor was barred from participating in future elections, as was the incumbent president, Lula da Silva. However, President Lula’s electoral eligibility was restored after the Brazilian Supreme Court found irregularities in his prosecution and sentencing.  Bolsonaro was accused of abuse of political power and misuse of the media by holding a meeting with ambassadors on July 18, 2022, at the Palacio da Alvorada, and attacking the electoral system without evidence; this led to the first time a former president was barred from future elections for electoral offenses, rather than criminal offenses. This is in addition to numerous other lawsuits that have been brought against the Former President, which total around 16. Bolsonaro has also been miredin accusations concerning the deaths of Indigenous Yanomami people, inaction leading to the deaths of 700,000 people from Covid-19, corruption in the Ministry of Education, and an attempt to buy votes from the poor. This is in addition to the accusation that Mr. Bolsonaro was involved in the storming of Brazil’s congress by his fierce supporters on January 8th. Mr. Bolsonaro has denied all these accusations and called the decision to bar him from upcoming elections an attack on Brazilian democracy.
Upon President Lula’s victory in the 2022 Presidential elections, Mr. Bolsonaro took leave for Florida, choosing to skip the ceremonial handing of power to his rival. His decampment to Florida was a move that weakened him politically,according to political analyst Thomas Traumann.According toTimemagazine, Bolsonaro spent his time in the U.S. “wandering around Florida supermarkets, eating fried chicken alone at fast-food restaurants, and holding court for supporters from the driveway of a modest home owned by a former ultimate-fighting champion in a gated community south of Orlando”, hardly a move befitting a man who only two months prior had been the leader of South America’s largest economy.
Bolsonaro and the Political Waves in Latin America
From the mid-2010s to the early 2020s, Latin America experienced a political phenomenon known as the conservative wave (onda conservadorain Portuguese andola conservadorain Spanish); left-wing governments that had been in power for decades suffered significant losses in democratic elections in succession. Indeed, from around 1998 to the mid-2010s, the pink tide ruled across the region, as left-wing politicians and populists such as Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez maintained a vise-like grip on the region’s politics. However, starting around 2014, things began rapidly changing. In Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a Peronist, was succeeded by Mauricio Macri, a center-right politician, in 2015. In Bolivia, Jeanine Áñez, a conservative politician, took over the presidency from Evo Morales, one of South America’s staunchest socialists. Yet the most significant victory was that of Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected to the presidency, defeating the Workers Party (PT) candidate Fernando Haddad who had been endorsed by the then Former President Lula. Latin America’s largest democracy had elected the man dubbed “The Trump of the Tropics” to its most important office. However, he failed to secure a second term in the 2022 presidential elections and his defeat further signaled the rise of the left in Latin America as Lula took over, and elsewhere on the continent, Luis Arce brought the MAS (Movimiento al Socialismo) party back to power in Bolivia, and Colombia elected its first left-wing president in history, Gustavo Petro.As of May 2023, 12 of 19 countries are now run by left-wing governments across Latin America, representing 92% of the region’s people and 90% of its GDP, which suggests that another pink tide might very well be on the rise again.
Despite the recent string of setbacks, Bolsonaro still maintains a stronghold on Brazilian right-wing politics. While he will not be able to contest the elections as an overturning of the electoral court’s decision remains unlikely, he still sees himself as a kingmaker of sorts and right-wing candidates will undoubtedly seek his endorsement to bolster their chances of victory. Owing to his immense popularity, Bolsonaro could considerably swing votes in the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo in favor of his preferred candidate. Therefore, ambitious conservatives will undoubtedly scramble for his seal of approval in these two crucial regions. Perhaps the only silver lining for Bolsonaro is that his recent trial has given his passionate fan base a new lease of life online, as donations have been pouring in from all over the country to offset about 1.1 million Brazilian reais (about $230,000) in fines levied by Sao Paulo state’s government for Bolsonaro’s repeated violations of health protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that Bolsonaro still enjoys enormous popularity among Brazilians,  however, it remains to be seen if it compares to the popularity that catapulted him to the presidency in 2018.
Looking Ahead
Ever since returning from Florida, Bolsonaro has been on a countrywide tour, disparaging the new government and engaging with his supporters. However, with his inability to participate in the upcoming elections, it is unclear whom conservatives will turn to with an eye on the upcoming elections. While political analysts do not expect Bolsonaro to ride quietly into the night, a period of political dormancy for 8 years leaves little hope for optimism for his supporters, who will be waiting with bated breath for his next moves.

Security Watch: Can Riyadh and Tehran Achieve a Lasting Détente?,"On March 10, 2016 Iran and Saudi Arabiasuspendeddiplomatic relations. This dynamic was a combination of geopolitical and domestic political factors. In geopolitical terms, the 2011 Syrian civil war was the epicentre of this rivalry, with Iranian support for the government of Bashar al-Assad on the one hand, and Saudi support for local terrorist groups on the other. Regarding internal developments in both countries, the attack on the Saudi embassy by Iranian demonstrators protesting against the Saudi monarchy’s execution of the Shiite cleric Nimr Al-Nimr on January 3, 2016, prompted the Saudi kingdom to close its diplomatic mission in Tehran.
The rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia has been a constant in the Middle East’s geopolitics for half a century. TheIslamic Revolution of 1979was the catalyst for this competition. The establishment of an Iranian theocracy prompted the new rulers to export their revolutionary ideology through religious figures trained in Iran and through arming Shiite militias in the region, starting with the Iraqi militias during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. In parallel, the Islamic Republic anchored its radical groups in Lebanon, notably Hezbollah from 1982, and in Yemen, the Houthists, an insurrectionary movement that emerged in the north-west of Sana’a during the 1980s and 1990s. Hezbollah’s formation has, above all, enabled the Islamic Republic to rise to the rank of a major regional player and, by so doing, to become an indirect player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
While this rivalry is primarily political, it also has a religious component. Both countries are Islamic (Islam is the state religion), yet each claims to follow two different currents of Islam: Shi’ism in the case of Iran and Sunnism in the case of Saudi Arabia. Thisschismwithin Islam emerged after the death of the Prophet Mohammed. Ali, Mohammed’s son-in-law, was designated as the legitimate heir by the Shiites because he came from the Prophet’s family. For Sunnis, the transmission of power is linked to the ability to lead. Saudi Arabia, stemming from the Wahhabi branch of Sunnism; considers the Shiites to be the main perpetrators behind the split in Islam. The kingdom alsorefersto the Hajj pilgrimage and its sovereignty over Medina and Mecca, the holy places of Islam, as examples of its legitimacy as the exclusive representative of the Muslim world.
Over the last two decades,unprecedented geopolitical upheavalshave enabled the Islamic Republic to strengthen its influence in the region. The overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime by the United States in 2003 saw a Shiite majority come to power in Iraq for the first time since the dawn of Islam. Added to this context were the “33-day war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006”, the “Pearl Spring” in Manama, Bahrain, and the Iranian regime’s support for the current Syrian regime; Iran’s recurrent military support for Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip; the Pasdaran’s military support and training for the Houthi militia in Yemen, resulting in regular missile strikes on Saudi soil between 2015 and 2023, including an oil facility belonging to the Saudi company Aramco in Jeddah.
The combination of all these factors makes the recent thaw between the two countries a remarkable and unexpected event. Above all, it is a victory for the People’s Republic of China (PRC). While discreet contacts between Riyadh and Tehran had been underway for two years by way ofIraq and Oman, the reconciliation between the regional adversaries is above all an undeniable success for Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Since the disengagement of the United States from Iraq, the People’s Republic has become a key player in the diplomatic and geoeconomic spheres, particularly thanks to its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to strengthen Beijing’s economic foothold in the Arabian Peninsula. The objective of this project is to leverage Chinese economic development projects across regional countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran. To achieve this, China needs to stablise relations between Riyadh and Tehran.
Riyadh sees the PRC as a means ofobtaining security guaranteesthat it considers insufficient from the Americans. The easing of relations with Iran is also enabling the Saudi kingdom to refocus its efforts on developing its economic transition, notably through the “Vision 2030” promoted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. As for the Islamic Republic, by supporting Beijing’s diplomatic initiative, it is weakening the anti-Iranian front led by the Americans and strengthening its sovereignty over Israel by hampering its attempts tonormalise relationswith the Saudi kingdom. This rapprochement also makes a large dent in the isolation in which the Islamic Republic has been held by the United States and, to a lesser degree, the Europeans, since former US President Donald Trump’sexit from the Iran nuclear dealin 2018. With increased trade with China and the promise of Saudi investment, the country’s economy could receive a much-needed boost.
The consequences of this normalisation are beginning to become clearer in the region. The rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran has enabled the Houthis and the al-Assad regime to re-establish communication with the Saudi kingdom. In particular, this has resulted in the restoration ofair transportbetween Riyadh and Sanaa. But it is in Syria that the political effect is most marked, with the re-establishment of diplomatic representation between Damascus and Riyadh and Syria’sreintegrationinto the Arab League. Health reasons are also contributing to this rapprochement. The civil war hasturnedSyria into a narco-state. The government produces Captagon, an amphetamine-based synthetic drug that is exported worldwide and is particularly popular in the Gulf States. For the Syrian regime, it is a way of making money, but also of putting pressure on its neighbours to obtain advantages in exchange for halting the production or distribution of the drug. For this reason, the Saudi kingdom has since agreed to reopen the way to economic cooperation and resume commercial investments in Syria.
The normalisation of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia is therefore a significant event for the Middle East. It is a recognition by the two regional powers that force, whether direct or indirect, has not worked. It should be noted that a week after the tripartite agreement, the Iranian chief negotiator of the agreement, Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council,visitedthe United Arab Emirates, leading a delegation of officials involved in security and finance issues. It is worth noting that Ali Shamkhani comes from Iran’s Arab minority and has a perfect command of Arabic, a way for Tehran to show its neighbours that the idea of a radical opposition between the Persian and Arab worlds is unfounded.
Improving dialogue with the Iranian regime is of great importance to the Saudi kingdom, which aspires to join theShanghai Cooperation Organisation, to which Iran is fully affiliated. This organisation aims to promote political, economic, and security cooperation between its members. For Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, this is a way of accelerating and expanding the number of Chinese investors in the Kingdom, in order to support the economic transition set out in “Vision 2030”.
With time, significant progress could be made towards peace and stability in the Arabian Peninsula. Progress in Yemen and Syria could help resolve theinstitutional crisisin Lebanon. Since the end of Michel Aoun’s mandate in October 2022, the Presidency of the State has remained vacant, owing to a lack of consensus. Until now, the candidacy ofSleiman Frangié, backed by Hezbollah, has come up against Saudi opposition, but the current impasse could be overcome by Iranian-Saudi cooperation in developing a comprehensive agreement on the distribution of key state posts and on a government programme, which would enable Lebanon to benefit from financial aid from the Gulf States. Trends that are likely to be observed over the short and medium term.

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: Terry Gou in 2024 Taiwan Presidential Election: Challenge and Opportunity,"Terry Gou, a prominent Taiwanese entrepreneur, has left an indelible mark on the electronics manufacturing industry through his visionary leadership and relentless pursuit of innovation. Born on October 8, 1950, in Taiwan, Gou is the mastermind behind Foxconn Technology Group, a multinational electronics contract manufacturer known for its significant contributions to the world’s tech giants. In addition to his remarkable business achievements, Gou ventured into the political sphere, actively participating in Taiwanese politics.
In 2019, Taiwan’s Kuomintang (KMT) party was looking for a strong candidate to run for the presidency in the upcoming 2020 elections. Terry Gou, known for his business acumen and high-profile status as the founder of Foxconn, stepped forward as a potential candidate and joined the KMT primary race. However, despite his high-profile status and financial resources, Gou faced stiff competition from other KMT candidates. In the primary election held in July 2019, he narrowly lost to Han Kuo-yu, the then-mayor of Kaohsiung, who secured the party’s nomination for the presidential race. After losing the KMT primary race in July 2019 to Han Kuo-yu, Terry Gouquit the KMT. Despite earlier indications that he might support the KMT’s nominee, he decided to run for the presidency as an independent candidate, signalling a break from the KMT’s official nomination process. Even though he eventually withdrew from the presidential race, Gou’s decision to remain neutral during the election was met with speculation and uncertainty about his intentions. This move was seen as somewhat unconventional, given that it is common for defeated candidates in a primary race to support their party’s nominee in a general election. After losing the primary and withdrawing from the race, Gou broke with the KMT after the 2019 presidential election, calling the KMT’s leadership “corrupt.”
In the 2022 local elections in Taiwan, the KMT won a significant victory. This has led many Nationalists (KMT party members) to believe they will win the presidential election in 2024. This gave Gou hope of becoming president again. On May 4, 2023, Gouapologisedto the KMT and Han for his betrayal four years ago and hoped to run in the KMT primary again. However, KMT faced this presidential election with no plans to hold a primary and instead used polls to recruit. This time, Gou pledged full support for New Taipei’s mayor, Hou Yu-ih, if he loses the party’s internal polls. According to multiple internally undisclosed KMT polls, Gou’s support rate is lower than Hou’s. This time, again, Guoexcusedthe KMT’s leadership for not publishing poll details. Nevertheless, the KMT still decided to nominate Hou to its Central Committee. However, according to multiple public opinion polls, Hou is alwaysrank thirdcompared to the DPP’s presidential candidate, Lai Ching-te, and the TPP’s presidential candidate, Ko Wen-je. Lai has always been the front-runner in a three-man race. Any opposite party, namely the KMT and TPP, will find itdifficult to winthe presidential election without cooperation. However, both parties do not have the incentive to work together at the moment.
Much evidence shows that Gou aims to run for president again as an independent candidate. Nevertheless, Hou’s support rate is still higher than Gou’s. This is to say that, Gou will be ranked fourth in this four-man race. If this is the case, voters’ support who do not like Lai will spread their support to Ko, Hou, and Gou. Thus, this scenario is best for Lai. Does this mean that Lai will definitely be the next president? Not necessary. Indeed, a four-man presidential race would create a situation in which Lai is sure to win, but it would also pressure opposition parties to cooperate. If the three groups of opposition candidates can integrate into a single group, it will have a good chance of defeating Lai.","August 05, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/terry-gou-in-2024-taiwan-presidential-election-challenge-and-opportunity/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,NewsRoom
Security Watch: What implications does the Niger coup d’état have for the Sahel?,"Last week, it was Mali, the day before yesterday, Burkina Faso, yesterday Guinea, and today Niger that wereshakenby a military putsch. On the evening of July 26, national programmes were abruptly interrupted when adozen soldiers appeared on televisionto proclaim the impeachment of democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who has been in power since 2021. In his speech, Colonel Major Amadou Abdramaneannouncedthe suspension of institutions and the closure of the country’s borders, justifying the coup by the collapse of the security situation in the country, which is home to Western military bases, notably American and French.
The announcement came after a tense day in the capital, Niamey. At around 7 a.m., soldiersabductedthe Head of State and his wife from their residence. Located inside the presidential palace, the residence is normally under the protection of the elite unit led by General Tchiani. According to several Nigerien and foreign sources, General Tchiani triggered this movement in response to President Bazoum’s bid toremove himfrom office. Mohamed Bazoum has always been aloyal democrat, opposed to the methods of the Wagner paramilitary forces and to putschists in neighbouring countries, and seen as a positive figure by many European and American leaders.
In Niamey, the relative calm of the first few days following the military takeover has given way to rallying support for the putschists and fears of a fiery outburst. Since July 30, there have been scenes of violence against Western embassies, with hundreds of demonstratorsdisplaying Russian flagsaround the capital. Violence has also been reported, notably at the headquarters of the former ruling party, the PNDS-Tarayya, where demonstrators set fire to andseverely assaultedpeople leaving the premises. Amid the security situation, the United States and several European countries haveinitiated the evacuation of their nationalsfrom the country. France notably evacuated577 nationals.
The regional geopolitical situation is all the more explosive. Rarely has the regional economic organisation, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), been as assertive regarding the political situation of a member state. Since the political instability in Niger, ECOWAS has been more determined than ever to intervene militarily to restore Mohamed Bazoum to power. The West African blocagreedon August 10 to deploy a regional intervention force. It took Ecowas seven weeks to deploy 7,000 troops to the Gambia in 2017, to compel President Yahya Jammeh to go into exile and cede the presidency to Adama Barrow, who had defeated him in an election. The mission in Niger would be much more complicated, given that the Niger army has garnered local support while ECOWAS has been talking tough. Its army has been extensively trained over the years by the United States and has been battle-tested for years in the fight against a insurgency. Spokespersons for the putschists in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso have subsequentlywarnedthe regional organisation against any attempt to intervene.
Europeans and Americans find themselves confronted with a delicate security backdrop. Failure in the fight against the jihadist groups, particularly in thetri-border areaof Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, has spurred the local armies to turn against their civilian authorities and undermine Western attempts to advance democracy. For years, France, the European Union, and the United States havesupportedthe democratic government of Niger across many domains: security, development, and humanitarian aid. Niger occupies a strategic position for French-American cooperation in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. Nearly 1,500 French and around 1,000 American soldiers are based in the country. American drones constantly monitor the Sahel and provide decisive intelligence for French operations, including theeliminationof the leader of the Islamic State in the Great Sahara, Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, in September 2021. Since General Tiani took power, all counter-terrorism operations conducted with Niger have been suspended.
Of all the countries in the region, Nigeria would have the most to fear from a fresh destabilisation in Niger. As the leading power in Ecowas and the most populous country in Africa (215 million inhabitants), Nigeria shares a border with Niger that stretches for more than 1,600 kilometres and fears that letting the putschist leaders settle in Niamey may lead to widespread insecurity, especially if the putschists do not respond to the security and social demands of its population over time. Nigeria fears that the grip of the putschists will only encourage the Nigerian army’s thirst for power. Nigeria had already experienced three decades of military dictatorship before the return to democracy in 1999. The Nigerian president is already facing a precarious state of insecurity propelled by several non-state entities: armed criminal gangs in the centre and north-west; terrorist groups, including Boko-Haram, in the north-east; and the agitation of separatist groups in the south-east.
With Russia continuing its advance on the African continent — Burkina Faso has turned to Moscow, and Mali has called on the mercenaries of the Wagner group — the West is in real danger of losing Niger. The head of the Russian armed militia, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has wasted no time. In a purported message, he is alreadyreaching out to the putschistsin Niamey, claiming that his troops can restore order and eliminate the terrorist groups. The collapse of the democratic regime in Niger risks becoming a new front for the Russian war machine and an accelerator for the expansion of the Kremlin’s influence in the Sahel. Niger is the world’s seventh-largest producer of uranium. Seizing part of the mineral wealth that can be reinvested in the war effort in Ukraine is likely to become a strategic ambition for the Russians.
Now that President Bazoum, who was one of the last allies of Paris and Washington in the region, has been removed from power, if the putschists manage to consolidate control over the next several weeks, it will be difficult for the Americans and French to maintain a presence in Niger. In a bid to distinguish themselves from their predecessors, the putschists have alreadydenouncedseveral military agreements signed with France and announced their intention toterminate the functionsof Niger’s ambassadors to France, the United States, Nigeria, and Togo. None of this augurs well for the fight against regional terrorism or the spread of freedom and democracy as a whole in the Sahel.

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: BRICS Countries Seek Financial De-risking Amidst Shifting Geopolitical Landscape,"In the midst ofescalating U.S. interest ratehikes and the concurrent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, BRICS countries find themselves increasingly susceptible to the resultant repercussions. As a response, these nations are amplifying their efforts to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. This drive has been particularly accentuated due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, compounded by Western-imposed financialsanctionsagainst Russia. These circumstances have intensified the push among BRICS countries to establish autonomous financial systems, thereby mitigating potential risks associated with “dollar sanctions.”
The entwining of a nation’s currency with the U.S. dollar demands meticulous alignment with American monetary policy and substantial financial investments tomaintainexchange rate stability. This commitment becomes especially taxing when substantial trade volume is involved, leading to exorbitant costs in dollar-denominated remittances. The adoption of local currencies, however, offers the advantage of diminished transaction expenses, lowered susceptibility to currency fluctuations, and reduced exposure to vast U.S. dollar holdings within foreign exchange reserves. In light of these dynamics, the proposal to introduce a shared currency within the BRICS consortium has gained significant traction.
Reports had earlier surfaced about the BRICS countries deliberating the potential adoption of a new “Common Currency.” Notably distinct from the Eurozone’s endeavour to replace individual national currencies with a single unit, the BRICS’ “Common Currency” envisages coexistence with the member nations’ existing local currencies.
The prospect of a “Common Currency” within the BRICS bloc has aroused considerable concern in Western circles. This concept is perceived as a strategic instrument aimed at challenging the dominance of the West-led, rule-based international order. Despite reassurances from figures such as Sukarno, whoassertedthat de-dollarization isn’t an explicit goal for the BRICS, and Lula, whoemphasisedthe currency’s role in fostering intra-BRICS trade rather than undermining national currencies or boycotting the U.S. dollar, it is undeniable that the introduction of a new global reserve currency by the BRICS would inevitably undermine the preeminent status of the U.S. dollar.
However, the much-anticipated “Common Currency” announcement at the South Africa Summit’s final BRICS declaration remained unfulfilled. This absence underscores the significant challenges that the BRICS countries continue to grapple with. Foremost among these is the requirement for substantial economic integration as a precursor to establishing a shared currency. This integration is essential to establishing unhindered free trade, a feat that demands a remarkable degree of economic freedom. In this regard, the BRICS member states still have considerable ground to cover before achieving the necessary level of economic convergence.","September 08, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-new-normal-la-nouvelle-normalite-%e6%96%b0%e5%b8%b8%e6%85%8b-brics-countries-seek-financial-de-risking-amidst-shifting-geopolitical-landscape/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,NewsRoom
Bolivia’s Thriving Lithium Sector Bolsters BRICS Membership Aspirations,"On August 1st, the Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the Andean country’s participation in the 15th BRICS Summit upon South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s invitation. President Luis Arce’s presence at one of the major multilateral meetings was counted on to present Bolivia’s Economic, Social, Community, and Productive Model, according toa social media postby Bolivia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rogelio Mayta. Mayta also reported that on June 12, President Arce manifested Bolivia’s desire to join BRICS, and his participation at the 15th Summit was seen as a crucial step for the country’s integration into the economic bloc.
Luis Arce took over the Bolivian presidency in 2020, as the country was facing an unprecedented health crisis in the form of COVID-19 and political unrest that had been brewing since former President Evo Morales had been ousted and replaced by Jeanine Áñez. The task that lay ahead of his first presidential term was daunting, yet on August 5th, 2023, as President Arce addressed Bolivians in the diaspora in commemoration of 198 years of independence, there seemed to be significant cause for optimism. In his speech, the President announced, “The various measures adopted by our Government have allowed our Plurinational State of Bolivia to achieve a cumulative inflation rate of just 0.8 percent as of June in this administration, the lowest in South America.” Additionally, in the same speech, President Arce highlighted programs such asBono Contra el Hambreand SIBOLIVIA credit, all of which have been crucial to the aforementioned model.
Since Evo Morales’ ascension to the presidency in 2006, Bolivia has centered its industrialization objectives around the abundance of lithium deposits in the country’s expansive salt flats. Indeed, Morales sought to completely nationalize the lithium production process, allowing for limited input from foreign entities, if any at all. Upon his forced resignation after widespread protests in 2019, Morales described his ousting as a “lithium coup”, accusing the United States of orchestrating the events to maintain its stronghold on lithium production in the country and discourage Bolivia from seeking alternative partnerships. However, underwhelming production has seen the government turn to other countries to ramp up the numbers to compete with neighboring Chile and Argentina. President Arce stated that Bolivia would begin exporting electric batteries in 2025, and in order to bring this goal to fruition, partnerships with the two BRICS powerhouses would be crucial.
So why is Bolivia turning towards BRICS now?
Bolivia has been jostling for space in the global economic order for some time now, seeking to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with other countries. The country has been actively working to build regional partnerships and has a longstanding desire to become a full member of Mercosur. Currently, it holds the status of an associate state. However, Bolivia’s application for full membership facedobstaclesin 2015 when Brazil’s right-leaning Congress posed a significant challenge to the process. It’s important to note that Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay had already approved Bolivia’s full accession at that time.However, the status quo changed, as President Lula da Silva now finds himself at the helm of Mercosur, albeit on a temporary basis. In an onlinearticle, he has been quoted as saying, “It is urgent that Bolivia becomes a full member of Mercosur,” which could signal positive developments for La Paz. Mercosur membership would allow Bolivia to fully participate in the decision-making processes of the bloc and enjoy reduced trade tariffs with other members, privileges it would not have otherwise enjoyed as an associate state.
Bolivia is also eyeing the lucrative BRICS membership due to recent developments in the previously mentioned lithium industry. In July 2023, President Arce stated that Bolivia had 23 million tons in lithium resources, a 2 million ton increase from the figures provided by theU.S Geological Survey. However, Bolivia’s production has failed to match these figures, an issue that the Bolivian government is keen to reverse. In the face of the transition to clean energy, lithium has seen an unprecedented surge in demand due to its use in electric car batteries, even being referred to as ‘white gold’, and President Arce has turned to the mineral to catalyze Bolivia’s industrialization process. The President announced apartnershipbetween Bolivia’s lithium development parastatal, Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB), and Russian firm Uranium One Group and China’s Citic Guoan Group, in a deal worth $1.4 billion. Given the crucial role that Chinese and Russian companies are expected to play in Bolivia’s lithium production, it is quite befitting that President Arce would turn to BRICS for furtherinvestment opportunities. Additionally, the fact thatBRICS countries contribute 31.5% of the global GDP, which is a larger share than that of rival bloc G7 at 30%, has made BRICS membership all the more coveted in international economic circles, as more than 40 other countries have inquired about membership. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Bolivia will be looking to partake in the resulting benefits from BRICS’ expanding economic purview.
Bolivia’s BRICS membership would also perfectly align with theBolivianizacionprocess that has taken root in the country.Bolivianizacionrefers to the process of bringing key industries, resources, or sectors under the control and ownership of the Bolivian government or state, with one of the key pillars being reducing the economy’s dependence on the American dollar, instead giving priority to the national currency, the Boliviano. China has been leading the de-dollarisation charge of the global economy, accusing the U.S. of weaponizing its currency in political affairs, while promoting the yuan as a medium of exchange for international transactions in its stead. In the same vein, Brazilian President Lula has also openly called for local currency settlements. Bolivia is one of the many countries that have grown weary of the U.S. dollar’s hegemony and will get behind the initiative of BRICS countries to topple the dollar as the benchmark currency.
Looking toward the future
As has been established, Bolivia envisages a future with a booming lithium production industry and rid of dependence on the American dollar. With the ascension to full Mercosur membership status looking even more certain, BRICS membership seems to be the next, logical step for the South American nation, as it seeks to strategically position itself in an emergent global political order. Bolivia’s political and economic ambitions would immensely benefit from joining this exclusive club that seems to be growing from strength to strength.
Bolivia has clearly charted a roadmap for its future and with an abundance of natural resources and positive macroeconomic indicators, the country’s potential cannot be underestimated.

[REPORT] Table for Two?: Italy and Other Upper-Middle Powers in Modern Global Affairs,"French President Emmanuel Macron embracing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris during Franco-German dinner which excluded Italy.

This February, the world felt fatigue as the War in Ukraine entered its second year (Gressel, 2023). Those in the immediate neighborhood of Ukraine have felt the economic ramifications of the conflict, while states in other regions have felt the brunt of the war’s impact on global food security (Welsh, 2023). In the midst of this somber anniversary, the continued unity of the West regarding the allocation of aid to Ukraine has not only proved indispensable to the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty, but also it is inseparable to the calculus that will dictate the length of the war (Gould-Davies, 2023). In the midst of this, an event as habitual and mundane to most seemed to have sewn division among the preeminent donor states to Ukraine.
The event in question is regarding a dinner held by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Élysée Palace in Paris (Reuters, 2023). While this may seem routine as Zelenskyy has and continues to meet with foreign dignitaries to garner support for the cause of Ukraine, there was the notable absence of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni whose predecessor had more cordial relations with his counterparts in Paris and Berlin through his contributions to a formal EU response to Russia’s attempted annexation of Eastern Ukrainian territory (Reuters, 2023b). Prior to dinner, the expected agenda of the meeting between Zelenskyy and the Franco-German delegation was to be on the subject of providing fighter jets to Ukraine in order to hedge against a Russian spring offensive (Caulcutt, 2023). While the defense of Ukraine seems like the logical foremost priority for Macron and Scholz, the details behind the meeting in Paris provide a deeper understanding as to the motivations to host the Ukrainian president.
Prior to the dinner with Zelenskyy, it was reported that Macron and his wife had different plans for the day that dinner in question was to take place (Caulcutt, 2023b). The decision to invite Zelenskyy had apparently come after Macron saw his address to the British parliament which occurred during the Ukrainian president’s official state visit to meet King Charles III as well as British prime minister Rishi Sunak (Gallardo, 2023). During the brief time between the end of Zelenskyy’s engagements in the United Kingdom and the dinner in question, Macron had hoped to plan an arrangement with the Ukrainian leader to a monument that was militarily and symbolically important to France so that they could provide him with honors near the anniversary of Russia’s invasion. This would not come to fruition in the manner which he had hoped due to scheduling differences between Zelenskyy’s camp and that of Macron’s.

The French president would ultimately provide his Ukrainian counterpart with honors and moreover, German chancellor Olaf Scholz also attended on short notice to also accompany the two European leaders. Taking these sentiments of the French into account when they were planning this seemingly impromptu meeting with Zelenskyy, the theme of symbolism becomes apparent. The event was an excellent opportunity for both Macron and Scholz to appear as strong European leaders through the political capital that meeting with the Ukrainian president provided to the English prior to the dinner in Paris. However, the disparity between symbolism and providing concrete material support were made clear when Macron did not immediately furnish the maximalist demands of Zelenskyy (France 24, 2023b).
Such a meeting may seem inconsequential to most observers, but this was not the case for Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni. Among her more prominent grievances for placing domestic considerations ahead of matters of European security. More telling was the response from Macron on the issue who declared that France and Germany have a special role in the matter given their previous history in trying to broker peace between the two warring states (Barigazzi, 2023). Although it is too early to judge the impact of this sudden engagement between three European leaders on current events, one may deduce certain realities that may be at play affecting continental policy. The first being that the self-imposed special role of France and Germany may extend beyond the current situation in Ukraine. Secondly, as with any modern republican  government, domestic politics are certainly taken into account by those in the position of governing.

This is especially true of parliamentary democracies in which chief executives must constantly perform diligently as well as being astute in managing coalitions to keep their mandate. Granted, when these underlying conditions are added to present external and internal political stimuli to the most important European states, it is more than likely that domestic considerations are taken within the decision-making calculus of both Macron and Scholz. In addition to this, any unnecessary strains on European unity will undoubtedly come at an inopportune time to the Ukrainian war effort as its plans to retake Kherson and other Russian occupied cities partially hinges on organizing the logistics of the lethal aid acquired from across a diverse array of Western partners (Preussen, 2023).

To further understand the policy decisions made by the French president and the German chancellor, it is critical to look at the circumstances of how they came to power as well as the challenges that they face. French president Emmanuel Macron faced a challenge as an incumbent from populist candidate Marine Le Pen during the 2022 French presidential election. Any result of the contest for the ability to govern from Paris would be consequential as the victor would influence how France decides everything from the extent of its participation in multilateral institutions to fiscal policy (Matthijs, 2022). The election was one that was not one that was handed to Macron as no candidate acquired a clear majority in the first round. As a result, the leading candidates had to clearly define their position on issues to differentiate themselves within the runoff.
Among the most consequential of these policy preferences that were pertinent to the current situation in Ukraine was the subject of French foreign policy. France has long been ambivalent towards the North Atlantic despite being one of the founding members of the organization. Among the first instances of a falling-out between France and NATO occurred in 1966 when Charles de Gaulle expressed his desire to withdraw his country from the alliance’s integrated military command until 2009 under Nicolas Sarkozy (Moran, 2008). One of the more recent disagreements on the matter of foreign affairs that occurred between France and its Western partners was over its disapproval of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States (Balfour, 2023). The connecting thread between these two events that occurred in different centuries is the French foreign policy tradition for autonomy in their strategic decision-making. Both Macron and Le Pen had fundamental disagreements on this issue but the framework in which they view how French foreign policy should be conducted is the degree of autonomy.
Le Pen’s stance on NATO mirrors that of de Gaulle as she hoped to withdraw France from NATO’s integrated command (Weber and Prochwicz-Jazowska, 2022). Macron viewed the issue as not of whether France should pull out of the institution’s integrated command, but as an aspiration of regional sovereignty (Moyer, 2022). Having said that, when France speaks of strategic autonomy for Europe, France knows that it cannot in theory escape its obligations as a signatory party of NATO. Paris might be of the opinion that due to the almost improbable chance of Article 5 being invoked in a modern setting, it is the armed forces equivalent to its nuclear stockpile which has a strong deterrence, but has limited practical use due to a number of external factors such as Russia perceiving the nuclear shield of the United States as the main deterrent for the alliance (Schumann, 2020).

Therefore, a more practical move in the eyes of Macron would be for Europe as a whole to develop their defense capabilities through French leadership to effectively deter malicious actors on its periphery. Strategic reforms are currently underway within the French armed forces to help with this objective from Paris (Dodson, 2023). Whether France could provide the effective direction necessary to achieve this policy is to be seen given the number of ongoing geopolitical developments in France’s immediate neighborhood. Within the realm of Europe, a prime example of this question being played out was a souring of Franco-Polish relations when Macron made comments seen as discrediting towards the unity and thus ultimately the effectiveness of the deterrence projected by the alliance as a whole (Baranowski, Quencez, and Techau 2020). In an age of an emerging multipolar order, the strength of America’s commitments abroad are brought into question by geopolitical observers. Although the U.S. has contingents of its armed forces stationed in the European theater, the bulk of its deterrence against malign actors within Europe has relied upon its nuclear arsenal.
As a founding member of NATO as well as an important actor within the EU, the word of France carries weight into the calculus of malign actors to upend European security architecture. For the Russians, a disunited transatlantic alliance would provide the pathway  Moreover, Macron’s diplomatic engagement with the Russian Federation prior to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine had proved a source of contention for states on NATO’s Eastern flank whose security primarily relies upon said projection (Caulcutt, 2022). The Russians in any attempt to disrupt the post-war order in Europe, would incur a response from other prominent European powers through yielding aid to Russia’s adversaries in order to salvage the prior balance of power (Rumer and Sokolsky, 2022). The window for Russia to achieve their policy objectives before the involvement of other powers largely depended upon a swift capture of Kyiv that is reminiscent of the war plans made by Austria-Hungary against Serbia over a century ago (Armstrong, 1927). Not doing so would allow for the Ukrainian armed forces to be sustained by lethal aid from abroad and thus a protracted conflict would be bound to occur against Russia’s favor. Outside of Europe, Macron faced the same issue of smaller states being affected by the sentiments and policy preferences of larger powers in the Indo-Pacific. On a visit to Beijing, Macron downplayed the importance of Taiwan’s continued ability to govern its own affairs due to his belief that Europe shouldn’t be involved in matters concerning superpowers (The Economist, 2023).
Within a short span of time, the Chinese diplomat to Paris made a comment that seemed to bring into question the legitimacy of ex-Soviet states, which is of particular concern to Europe since the Baltic states are members of critical European institutions (Zimmermann, 2023). Although the Chinese diplomat walked back his statement, contradictions still lie within the heart of the conduct of foreign affairs under Macron. One of the primary instigators of the Russo-Ukrainian War has been the line of thought that places greater importance upon the aims of larger powers than the fundamental existence as well as the sovereignty of smaller nations. Perhaps the most blatant contradiction of Macron’s aims are to pursue unilateral policy preference through the instrument of centrally multilateral institutions.

Though Macron’s comment over Taiwan has been framed as a diplomatic blunder adding to a string of misfires, especially in the Indo-Pacific, there may be something larger at play within the international system (Julienne, 2023). The exact change could be the extent to which states that are not superpowers can meaningfully engage in diplomacy with their near hegemonic counterparts without multilateral organizations with a strong consensus. While not the primary guarantor of security in East Asia, France has a nuclear arsenal and the equipment to forwardly position their stockpile should in a drastic event the need to do so (Vincent, 2022). Yet, it has not changed the minds of either the Russian federation or China on matters which they see as fundamental to their interests. This newfound era of great-power competition may have broken the monotony of solely covering American foreign policy, but superpowers, especially the policymakers within are very attentive to how they are perceived by academia and in the media.
Although the political economy of contemporary Europe was developed in a unipolar moment, the institutions which allowed for a common monetary policy were the multilateral institutions established in an era of great power competition (Masters, 2023). It is understandable for European policymakers to throw around the idea of pursuing a more pragmatic foreign policy in a more competitive global environment, especially in the shadow of the European debt crisis (Dadush, 2010). However, doing so could possibly compromise the long held values of the EU in the midst of enlargement of important European organizations and slow the momentum of the reinvigoration within these organizations brought on by the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Lavikainen, Särkkä, and Pesu 2023). In the worst case of the pursuit of such a policy, the rules-based international order from which the region has greatly benefitted, may be harmed in the long-term as they would acquiesce to norms that are in opposition to ones that are Fnecessary to its function (Scott, 2020).
On the domestic front, the most pressing internal issue for Macron has been a grassroots protest movement surrounding unpopular pension reforms within France (France 24, 2023a). Popular movements from the French public to express their discontent with their discontent in matters of policy such as these are not new to Paris, but have been an integral thread to modern France’s political development since its tradition away from monarchical rule. As one of the most notable French leaders since not only François Mitterrand but also those who wore an imperial crown within France, his “reign” has not been without incident (de Weck, 2022). One of the most notable incidents to occur under his tenure as the French president was the Yellow Vest protests that erupted five years ago (Cigainero, 2018). The yellow vest protests started as a result of discontent with the economic conditions within the country (Dodman, 2022). What has made the present pension reforms so controversial within French society was that Macron implemented his rarely used constitutional powers bypassing parliament (RFI, 2023). When viewing his approach to issues foreign and domestic, one can assume that if Macron had the bureaucratic authority to push forth what he sees as the direction of Europe, he would do so over the objections of smaller states with less of a say within the EU.

Though Macron may have his attention directed toward the medium of what Europe can provide French interests, his German counterpart is concerned with the integrity of the medium as well as domestic issues within the Federal Republic of Germany. Moreover, while Macron may be likened to For those unfamiliar with the German language, there are abstract concepts that are expressed within the language that are often not expressed in others, as any language has. These words have had a profound impact on several fields such as psychology and philosophy (Leary, 1980). One such concept derived from German Idealism that is not only relevant to philosophy, but to developments in global affairs is the word ‘Weltanschauung,’ meaning a worldview (Naugle, 1998). The Russian invasion of Ukraine challenged the historically pacifist worldview of Germany and provided the motivation for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to announce a ‘Zeitenwende,’ roughly meaning a watershed moment (Tausendfreund, 2022).
Such a fundamental shift in posture surrounding the country’s foreign policy has sparked concern both within Germany and externally provided the past of the country. In contrast to his French counterpart whose significance has been the result of his electoral success in line with French politicians of note, Scholz is significant due to presiding over Germany during a time of great change in its policy posture. Though his mind may be preoccupied with the legacy of the previous chancellor, his tenure bears resemblance to Helmut Kohl whose time in office was marked by him being thrust upon a historic event without having prior knowledge of what they would face as chancellor (Stelzenmüller, 2017). The noun is like the Weltanschauung, something that is all encompassing of not only the external material conditions surrounding the state one finds themselves in, but also how and why they may respond to these conditions.
As with any philosophical concept, worldviews are open to interpretation by individuals and those within the halls of power who have the ability to mold a neutral concept into tangible practice. Although the field of German behavioral sciences no longer has the influence it once had, nefarious actors have interpreted concepts from the field to their own ends (Yablon, 2003). Furthermore, the ecosystem for concepts from this field to emulate into other spheres of civic life still exists within the country and such concepts remain significant in their potential to have influence.
Therefore, Scholz wanted to explicitly define what Germany would pursue under the profound changes occurring not only within Europe but the international system as a whole (Tallis 2023). The policy changes that the German chancellor has made under this new framework span everything from foreign affairs to energy security (Leoni, Ryan, and Weber 2023). The progress made to ensure these changes are made concrete have been mixed, with Germany having the most success in energy security. German security policy has attempted to meet the newfound challenges it faces by pledging to meet the quota set by NATO for defense spending, but has not outlined a course of action to enlarge their overall defense budget (Fuhrhop, 2023). In addition, there has been a lack of a cohesive doctrine surrounding several key areas of interest to Europe such as how Germany would approach great-power competition. The specter of the ‘Zeitenwende’ has also expanded beyond Germany, namely in how great powers such as China have changed considerably in recent years as Xi Jinping has consolidated his power (McGregor, 2018).
These changes have not gone unnoticed as German Foreign Minister Baerbock described her visit to the East Asian power as ‘shocking’ (Deutsche Welle, 2023). There also may be eroding rules of engagement between the three foremost powers with Russia using NATO enlargement as a pretense for their invasion of Ukraine and China describing its defense policy as ‘defensive in nature,’ but within the same policy it describes it will construct infrastructure to secure its controversial territorial claims (Pifer, 2022). These states are likely to use a slow implementation of a mix of diplomacy and operations other than war against one another until flashpoints inevitably arise (Siebens and Lucas, 2022). Regardless of the debate surrounding NATO expansion even though the admission process is multilateral, other great powers are pursuing unilateral action in a multipolar environment. Furthermore, while European leaders have an aversion to the emerging competition in the Indo-Pacific, as one of the most important economic blocs globally they have the potential to lessen the intensity of unilateral action by the world’s superpowers.
Even though Scholz hoped to explicitly define what this new age would mean for German policy, the inadequacies present in achieving their policy preferences leave space for others to interpret outside of the context of security. This however, is not unique to Germany as many other NATO members face hurdles toward meeting the level of military spending that they have publicly committed to (Fonfria and González-Regueral, 2023). While this is understandable provided economic conditions surrounding Europe, the states that have the ability to make the necessary level of funding to project out deterrence will have a greater voice in European affairs for they will have a greater degree of political independence. This imbalance among NATO members and the continued gulf in defense spending will fail to prevent actions against European interests unless they can produce the methods for a cohesion among the diverse array of the region’s armed forces (Chihaia, 2023).

Due to inheriting a Germany that is a leader in European affairs, many dimensions of domestic policy have been viewed through a lens that views its ability to maintain the ability of Germany to continue in its position. To accomplish this, Scholz needed a policy framework from which he could secure German leadership. Early in his chancellorship, he had sought to use the political and economic decisions of his predecessor as a foundation for his proposed continuation of Germany’s policy posture (Gehrke, 2021). However, the Russo-Ukrainian War had altered the whole adoption of his predecessor’s policies because the environment of which they originally stood no longer existed or made sense for them to continue. Among the first of these policies to go was the previously implemented energy regime that sought to bring Germans affordable gas and to bring Russia closer to the European Union in hopes that Russia’s norms would be more in line with Europe (Stelzenmüller, 2022).
With Russia’s weaponization of German dependence on their gas, Scholz sought to secure different suppliers of liquefied natural gas from states such as the United Arab Emirates (Braun, 2023). The hopes of Russia in this action was to force Europe into accepting their policy objectives in Ukraine without resistance as resistance against Russia would coincide with a steep economic price. Worryingly, Russia’s alleged actions of destroying the Kakhovka dam may not only be a continuation of their weaponization of energy but potentially a glimpse of what environmental warfare could look like in the 21st century (Mitchell, 2023) . Tactics in this realm adversely affect civilians and have little legal precedent regarding its prosecution. One more issue that could hinder Germany’s ability to be a leader within Europe is the continued financial health of the region. With the precedent set during the Greek debt crisis, Germany is seen as one of the fiscal pillars of which the EU leans on (Council on Foreign Relations, n.d.).
If intervention in the economic affairs of Greece serves as a precedent, Germany will try to avoid a similar situation in the near future with other EU states. This issue contains many dimensions for Berlin as it pertains to its foreign policy. A financial crisis in the same vein of the Eurozone Crisis, would not only upend the ability of EU states to aid Ukraine and sow division among eurozone participants who still have a vivid memory of the issues brought by austerity (Steinberg and Tamames, 2022). In a domestic context, German citizens could once again be apprehensive about footing the bill for the European project and become more eurosceptic in voting (Rathbun, Powers, and Anders 2019). Although the current focus of the EU is directed toward whether to provide Ukraine a security guarantee to Ukraine, they must remember that the event which spiraled into the current conflict stemmed from a desire on the Ukrainians to one day be considered for closer ties to Europe (Toygür and Bergmann, 2023). Considering this, it is a very real possibility that the future behavior of Ukraine and the union’s frontier will depend on the effort they put in the integration of Ukraine into the European project. Moreover, with America supporting defense increases in countries with formerly pacifist postures such as Germany and Japan, European states will not only have to navigate a world of multipolar competition, but also to reign in formerly aggressive regional powers within their neighborhood (Giltner, 2023).

Before Meloni entered office, there were concerns from the European Union and from what a potential Meloni tenure as prime minister would mean in terms of policy. One of the most immediate concerns held by some was that Italy could go down a path of illiberal democracy like other states governed by far-right parties within Europe (Bastasin, 2022). Other such fears of a Meloni-lead Italy were a worry that more far-right parties would make electoral gains across Europe and be soft on Russia in the backdrop of the Russo-Ukrainian War (Dessì and Ntousas, 2022). Further adding to the uncertainty of Brussels toward Meloni was that she was following the administration of someone who made a declaration to do whatever it would take to save the Euro at one of the European Union’s most pivotal moments (Lachman, 2021).
Due to a disconnect between Brussels and Meloni, Rome has pursued a foreign policy that is often misunderstood by the EU but is clearly fulfilling the policies set out by Meloni. European worries over Italian domestic policy can be over something as simple as protecting the native language of Italy (Reuters, 2023c). This policy could be easily misconstrued as an action against the plurality of multilateral institutions such as the EU and the use of multiple official languages in these types of organizations as far back as the foundation of the League of Nations. At the same time, Italy was at the heart of some of the worst rates of Covid-19 casualties among its older population on the continent and promoting one’s language over another is something that French have been doing since 1994 (French Ministry of Culture, n.d.).

Furthermore, the issue of European unity in the face of a war in Europe that could have been a disconnect over policy between Italy and the EU has not come to a breaking point. This has not been easy for Meloni as she faced comments that could have been seen as sympathetic to the Russians from Matteo Salvini and the late Silvio Berlusconi (Roberts, 2022). In addition, she has also taken a tough stance on China by signaling that she may leave the Belt and Road Initiative (Tocci, 2023). Perhaps the issue that Meloni has pursued with the most vigor has been the issue of migration. This has been a long sore issue between Italy and its peers as spats between the two have resulted in canceled trips on the part of Italy to discuss migration policy (Leali, 2023). In the backdrop of this era of sour relations, the United Kingdom and France hammered out a deal in order to tackle cross-channel migration (Le Monde with, A. F. P. 2023). Such sidelining of Italian interests while more influential European states accomplish their policy directives can be traced as far back as the 1915 Treaty of London where promises were not kept to Italy in the aftermath of the Great War (Albrecht-Carrié, 1939). It would not be until late June would there be a thaw in Italo-French relations for them to resume cooperation surrounding European migration (Corbet and Charlton, 2023).
Beyond the issue of migration, Italy has sought to extend its influence beyond Europe. This can be seen in the diplomatic initiatives it has undertaken in the Mediterranean and the Middle East where they have sought to not only secure new sources of energy but to foster long standing ties (Sassi, 2023). Middle powers such as Italy and its peers have also made efforts to be more visible in the Indo-Pacific as geopolitical rivalry has increased in that region (Crabtree, 2023). While there have been recent attempts to define middle powers by others, one could make the argument that nations like Italy that are making diplomatic and security initiatives in multiple regions beyond its borders belong to a class above what are considered middle powers but not great powers (Moeini et al., 2022). Understanding this exact dynamic can help Europe better understand Italian actions and can provide a path for greater cooperation in other realms.
Meloni has many challenges ahead of her such as navigating her coalition beyond the death of Berlusconi (Zalewski, 2023). Though her tenure as Italian prime minister has been an anomaly among her peers on the far-right, the European Union should keep a watchful eye on Italy. There can be a wide range of reasons for her rather tame policy decisions in comparison to her more illiberal counterparts such as the magnitude of funding that the country has received from the EU (Loguercio, 2023). However, what is important is that Meloni seeks to cooperate with the rest of Europe as opposed to not doing so. Although a wide range of topics were discussed from German philosophy to the individuals who shape Europe today, the predicament which Europe finds itself in today is best summed up by a quote from a Spanish philosopher. Jose Ortega y Gasset once stated, “Civilization is nothing else but the attempt to reduce force to being the last resort” (Ortega y Gasset, n.d.). Choosing not to cooperate with Italy and other states within Europe with one another will result directly in the erosion in their ability to reduce force as a matter of last resort.

(REPORT) Italy and the BRI: in the Shadow of Sino-American Competition and Balancing National Interest,"Italy’s exit from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seems to be inescapable.  The government in Rome seems now poised to not renew the BRI Memorandum of Understanding (MoU); however, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her executive have yet to find a way out of the deal without displeasing or antagonizing China. Meloni’s primary goal is to defend Italy’s national interests, and while exiting the BRI would ensure it, the risk of retaliation from China is currently too big of a threat, which puts the government on a difficult path.
News of Rome’s willingness to possibly withdraw from the BRI surfaced in early May (Albanese, 2023). Rome’s calculations should not be surprising. While enticing at the time of its signing, the BRI has not brought great dividends. The former Conte Government signed a MoU in March 2019, making Italy the first G7 country to become a partner in China’s BRI. In addition to the main MoU between the two nations, twenty-nine other agreements (ten commercial and nineteen institutional in character) were also inked. The MoU is valid for four years and contains a clause of automatic renewal in March 2024 if Italy does not notify China of its intention to withdraw three months prior. The MoU, however, is not a legally binding contract but simply an agreement outlining a framework for cooperation with mostly political implications for the two parties. The BRI is part of China’s strategy aimed at establishing a stable strategic space that is conducive to the long-term development of China’s economic and politico-military influence and power. In the words of David Sacks, “China has had a fair amount of success in redrawing trade maps around the world” (McBride et al., 2023) and Beijing’s focus on Italy is aimed at expanding Chinese clout in Europe.
Against this backdrop, the Italian government finds itself at a crossroads, dictated in large part by national interests but also by the growing Sino-American competition. In stark contrast to 2019, when the MoU was signed, the Biden administration has been soliciting partners (Brazinsky, 2023)and allies across the globe to reevaluate their ties to China, going beyond pure economic interests and instead emphasizing security aspects. A refusal to renew the MoU would align with the political trend seen in Italy since the Draghi government – successor to Conte’s – and with Meloni’s well-known position on the issue. During Meloni’s campaign, the current PM went as far as categorizing the MoU a mistake (Italy’s PM, 2022), complementing her clear transatlantic focus.
However, the fact that there has been no official decision yet shows how delicate the situation is for the Italian government. This conundrum is both deeply woven into and simultaneously a symptom of the worsening Sino-American competition. There are risks inherent to this conundrum, regardless of the path the government chooses, given potential repercussions from Beijing or more pressure from Western allies. Italy’s struggle is a prime example of the push for decoupling (Posen, 2023) and friend-shoring, currently being rebranded as de-risking (Ardense, 2023), especially on the technological and trade fronts. As such, Italy’s hedging strategy towards Washington and Beijing is being questioned (Lohman, 2022) by other Western powers, and will have to come to terms with the current geopolitical global reality.
For Italy, China represents an important trade partner. As of 2022, China sits in second place and tenth in Italian imports (Italy Imports, n.d.) and exports (Italy Exports, n.d.), respectively. However, since the trade spike in February 2023, the highest ever recorded in terms of bilateral trade, exports to China have been falling, nesting at circa 1.281 USD bn in April 2023 (Italy Total Exports, n.d.). Similarly, imports have also been witnessing a gradual downward tendency since 2022, reaching 4.272 USD bn in April 2023 (Italy Total Imports, n.d.). Along a similar orientation, China’s outbound investment in 2022 dropped 22% compared to 2021, reaching a total sum of 7.9 billion USD (Kratz et al., 2023). More broadly, according to data from the Rhodium Group, Chinese FDI in Italy experienced a significant decrease from US$650 million in 2019 to US$20 million in 2020 and further to US$33 million in 2021 (Xie, 2023).
Despite this downward course, Italy remains a geostrategic point of entry (Contessi, 2019) for Chinese goods to make it into the European market. This has become more evident, especially after Chinese state-owned COSCO Shipping’s acquisition (Georgiopulous, 2016) of the Piraeus port in Greece. From the Aegean Sea, Chinese goods enter the Mediterranean and then onto the Adriatic or the Tyrrhenian Seas as the obligatory routes to connect maritime and inland trade routes in Europe (Page, 2014). From Italy, thanks to existing infrastructure, Chinese goods can easily enter the Austrian, Swiss, German, Hungarian, and Balkan markets.
In 2017, as part of the EU-China Connectivity Platform, the port of Trieste was included in the Trihub project, aimed at bettering the rail connections of the port and resulting in direct trains between Trieste and Venice. Within this context, the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) planned to construct the station of Trieste Servola (Ghiretti, 2020) along with a deep water quay in the port of Venice (Bottazzo, 2019). Similarly, cooperation in the port of Ravenna in 2018, where China Merchant Group invested 10 million euros (New Silk Road, 2018) with the aim of making the city the European hub of naval engineering and Oil & Gas. Not limiting its focus to the Adriatic, China also invested in Italy’s west coast, given its close proximity to the French and Iberian Peninsula markets. In 2016, COSCO Shipping and Qingdao Port bought 49.9% of the Vado Ligure container terminal (Ghiretti, 2021). The BRI framework represents both an extension as well as an organic progression of pre-existing bilateral relations, consolidating them under a unified platform. Since its inception, Italian exports to China have experienced significant growth, surpassing previous levels with a remarkable 42% increase between 2019 and 2021. The bilateral trade volume reached nearly $78 billion in 2022. However, it should be noted that the MoU has not resulted in a deeper integration in comparison with other EU countries. While there has been an overall increase in interaction between the two nations, the trade balance remains heavily skewed in China’s favor. Italian exports to China have grown at a less substantial rate than anticipated, rising from $13 billion in 2019 to $16.4 billion in 2022. On the other hand, Chinese exports to Italy have witnessed a significant surge, escalating from $31.7 billion in 2019 to $57.5 billion in 2022. Consequently, China stands as Italy’s second-largest supplier, having captured an 8.2% market share. However, Italy remains a secondary trading partner for China, ranking 22nd in terms of customers and 24th in terms of suppliers globally (Fatiguso, 2021).
Despite the seeming linearity in bilateral relations and Italy following general European interest and the prospect of getting closer to the fastest-growing market on the planet, Rome’s decision to join the BRI raised concerns among Western allies, particularly the United States and certain European partners (NSC 45 Archived, 2019; Ching, 2019). The main motivation behind Italy’s participation in the BRI was the extravagant commercial promises made by China, which, albeit never fully specified, were presumably supposed to cater to Rome’s economic and investment needs while also furthering Beijing’s interests. While the MoU was an opportunity to strengthen economic ties and integration for Italy, China saw it as a strategic decision that could have implications for Italy’s geopolitical positioning and its relations with the United States. By endorsing the BRI, Italy significantly bolstered President Xi Jinping’s influence and the initiative itself. Consequently, Rome was perceived as the weakest European link (Roberts, 2020) in the power struggle with China. Despite the reputational damage and political costs incurred, Italy’s BRI membership did not disrupt its existing alliances with the U.S. and other European nations. However, after two years, the new government under Mario Draghi still chose to distance itself from China and instead shifted towards a more Atlanticist and European-oriented foreign policy.
Currently, maintaining this trend, Italy’s cooling relationship with China has led Giorgia Meloni to adopt a harsher stance towards Beijing and align more with Washington’s interests. Meloni has, for instance, been vocal in her support for Taiwan  and has underscored how the BRI economic returns have been falling short (Ai et al., 2023). Meloni’s government has therefore realized how the traditional Italian hedging strategy towards the U.S. and China needs to be refocused. Meloni’s Atlanticist credentials (Marrone, 2022) and inclinations play a crucial role in Italy’s decision. However, making the choice is proving harder than expected for the Italian government, which has to deal with multiple factors affecting its national interest.
First, the geostrategic shift caused by the Ukraine War puts Italy in a difficult position. With NATO’s refocus on its Northeastern front, Italy is being forced to reappraise its strategic approach toward its immediate geographic sphere of interest, the broader Mediterranean, as underscored in a press release from the Council of Ministers (Comunicato Stampa, 2023). Additionally, NATO’s growing attention on the Indo-Pacific and the perception of China as a major challenge to its interests and security would clash with a potential renewal of the BRI MoU. It is safe to assume that the Italian government understands that NATO unity is necessary to maintain a credible deterrence posture and ensure the collective defense and security of its members. This perspective is particularly relevant in the case of Italy now that its southern front will see less NATO involvement in the foreseeable future. Pushing Italy’s national agenda within the NATO framework could have adverse consequences. Italy’s mismatch with NATO’s priorities would result in self-marginalization, which, in turn, would prompt a chain reaction wherein Italy’s voice and weight in influencing the direction of the alliance would gradually reduce.
Second, there is a growing necessity within the EU and its members to attempt to reach a common stance toward China that somewhat aligns with Washington while also balancing a desire to engage with China on trade and investment, resisting its economic coercion. However, Italy’s renewal of the BRI MoU would risk sending a mixed signal to both Washington and its EU partners, undermining unity in the EU’s approach to China as well as the Union’s negotiating power. Beijing is likely to attempt to drive a wedge between the EU and the U.S. and prevent Europe from following Washington, particularly regarding measures like export controls of key technologies. Unsurprisingly, Chinese officials seem to have launched a charm offensive, pivoting to the economic turnout that the BRI brought to Italy since 2019. Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, met with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani in February this year, expressing Beijing’s interest in strengthening bilateral relations based on the already solid track record. Similarly, China’s Ambassador Jia Guide (Fatiguso, 2023), in an interview with an Italian newspaper, underscored the importance of the MoU and its value in terms of maintaining positive commercial exchanges. However, despite the lack of integration outlined in the above section, should Italy decide not to renew the BRI MoU, it will likely miss out on potential trade opportunities. One specific concern is related to Italian ports along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas. It should be recognized that railway services, due to their comparatively higher costs, are unlikely to account for a significant proportion of total import and export flows. Therefore, the focus on expanding port infrastructure becomes all the more crucial.  Investments in new port facilities, though relatively less novel compared to railway developments, has the potential to bring about significant changes. It is worth noting here that the expansion of the Port of Piraeus has already heightened the Mediterranean Sea’s significance as a pivotal trade hub for China. Consequently, Italy faces a substantial challenge as its ports could potentially face displacement because of the Piraeus port’s capacity, particularly if the latter is connected to the heart of Europe through railway networks. As a result, goods might bypass Italian ports altogether, bypassing the need for transportation via Italian railways.
Third, the Meloni government has to deal with the priorities and perspectives of the three different parties making up the government coalition when it comes to relations with Beijing. Meloni, as previously noted, has been very vocal and perhaps even harsh towards China and the BRI. Forza Italia’s representatives fall in line with Meloni and her party. Notably, Senator Stefania Craxi (Craxi, 2023), a member of Forza Italia and chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, has expressed her intention to present a resolution in said committee, aiming to ensure the Parliament’s comprehensive engagement and to assess the situation realistically. Senator Craxi has highlighted that the MoU holds implications that extend well beyond the realm of commerce, emphasizing that Italy’s trade with China lags behind that of other EU nations, despite being the sole Western European country to have signed an MoU. According to the senator, the decision to sign the MoU was an unfortunate mistake that has had negative consequences for Italy. Similarly, during an interview with II Messaggero, Antonio Tajani, the Italian Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, discussed Italy’s reconsideration of its participation in the BRI (Bechis, 2023). This is taking place within the broader context of Western countries reevaluating their stances on Beijing, in light of China’s increasing assertiveness and its unfair market practices, which are perceived as long-term strategic threats. Tajani stressed that China is regarded as a competitor and that, while Italy aims to maintain positive relations, it is crucial that all parties adhere to the same set of rules. He expressed opposition to practices such as social and environmental dumping, unfair competition, and the extraction of knowledge without a commitment to long-term investment. Giancarlo Giorgetti, Italy’s Economy Minister, echoed similar sentiments during the G7 Finance meeting, emphasizing the importance of economic security in relation to the BRI. Giorgetti highlighted the connection between economic security and the green- and energy transitions, as a significant proportion of critical raw materials originate from countries influenced by or having strong ties with China. He underscored that this aspect makes economic security a central concern. On the other hand, Matteo Salvini, leader of the League – in second place in the coalition – has been very ambiguous. Salvini, during a video conference at the Adriatic Sea Summit, declared to have his own ideas about the BRI, that of engaging in 360-degree trade (Folli, 2023). In other parts of the party, opinions are more unequivocal. Massimiliano Fedriga, President of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region and a notable member of the League, emphasized that the current international context necessitates different decision-making. Ultimately, the League, including its leader, Matteo Salvini, as he himself has acknowledged, will need to cooperate and uphold unity within the government. Overall, while there seems to be a general alignment regarding the BRI and the MoU, the way to achieve decoupling from China is not clearly set and agreed upon within the government, given that the stress over the need for “pragmatism and serious reflection” has yet to be clearly defined.
Lastly, Italy is actively seeking closer bilateral relations with Taiwan, as demonstrated by Gian Marco Centinaio, Vice President of the Italian Senate, visiting Taipei (Yeh, 2023) and meeting with government and parliamentary officials, including President Tsai Ing-wen. Centinaio expressed strong support for Taiwan, recognizing it as an important stronghold of democracy deserving of backing. Echoing these concerns, Foreign Minister Tajani emphasized the importance of maintaining the status quo in the Indo-Pacific region and preventing Taiwan from becoming a second Ukraine.
Rome and Taipei are discussing strengthening bilateral ties. This includes plans to open a Taipei representative office in Milan in addition to the existing one in Rome. Furthermore, the establishment of a direct flight route between Milan and Taipei, along with the commitment of the Italian Navy in the Indo-Pacific region, are key measures to foster closer cooperation.
Italian officials from the Ministry of Enterprise, led by Adolfo Urso, also visited Taiwan to explore potential collaborations in semiconductor production and exports (Albanese, 2023). Discussions involved exploring opportunities for cooperation with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and there is merit to a perspective where Italy may be considering not renewing the BRI MoU with China in exchange for bolstering semiconductor ties with Taiwan. Italy’s focus on Taiwan and its semiconductor industry stems from both domestic needs and international strategic goals. The sector holds particular significance for Italy’s automotive industry, and there is a broader EU and U.S. agenda to reduce dependence on external supply chains. Additionally, Italy’s participation in partnerships supporting emerging technologies adds to the appeal of the semiconductor sector, given the rapid pace of technological innovation and competition.
The geopolitical implications of a potential chip deal with Taiwan are complex. Such a deal could gain Italy the approval of the G7 and the EU, as it would be seen as a positive step towards diversifying away from a reliance on China. However, it would likely also put a strain on Italy’s relationship with China, as well as China’s interest in preserving its global influence and all BRI engagements. China’s rapid economic growth and global influence have enabled it to exert pressure on countries and international organizations to align with its “One China” policy. Engaging with Taiwan in a manner that China views as enabling the erosion of its perceived territorial integrity can result in diplomatic consequences, strained relations, and economic repercussions, dictated by the need to maintain its global influence and, in this specific instance, BRI engagements.
Meloni and her government find themselves in a particularly delicate position. Regardless of which decision they make, Italy will have to navigate potential economic and political repercussions. Meloni herself has to demonstrate that her Atlanticist and Europeanist rhetoric will be followed by action. Currently, given the mounting pressure under intensified Sino-American rivalry, Italy’s Western partners have influenced its choices, somewhat limiting them.
There is a compelling argument to be made in favor of truncating the MoU. The grand promises of economic development, investment and exports, and access to the Chinese market have not been realized and did not bring the economic growth the Italian government was hoping for. While it is undeniable that the COVID-19 pandemic had a non-negligible impact on bilateral trade, the China decoupling trend, accompanied by Italy’s need to focus on spurring domestic growth, makes renewing the MoU a gamble which risks increasing Rome’s public debt, already the second highest in the eurozone. Secondly, not renewing the MoU would help Italy gain a better standing with its traditional allies in the G7 and the EU, and potentially shaping the future of EU-China relations. In the spirit of a unitary approach towards China, Italy’s abandonment of the BRI could prompt other European nations to drop their own BRI cooperations altogether or at the very least, reduce them. As such, while exiting the BRI would represent a diplomatic setback vis-á-vis China, there would be limited economic fallout but more long-term assurances on the critical supply chains and security for Italy.
Presently, it appears likely that Italy will abandon the BRI. However, that decision is not as clear-cut and still awaits Parliamentary deliberation and officialization. Italy needs a calculated plan to engage in de-risking practices if this is indeed the government’s objective. This plan would need to entail having a clear vision of both the possible short- and long-term gains to be made and the repercussions that could be suffered. As such, Italy seems poised to maintain its hedging stance towards Beijing and Washington, probably pursuing alternatives to the MoU itself, in order to reassure G7 and EU allies while simultaneously maintaining cooperation with China. Dropping the MoU represents a gamble that Italy might not be able to afford in the short term, both politically and economically. On the purely economic front, in the words of Wang Huyao, “the Italian economy is going nowhere and joining the Belt and Road Initiative earlier than others is a great opportunity… Italy has many economic problems, Europe is in crisis, and the BRI is the only major global investment plan.” (Santelli, 2019). On the political front, the aforementioned Jia Guide was quite clear as he stated that “China attaches great importance to the partnership with Italy,” and that all of the achievements in bilateral trade and investments achieved since 2019 are “inseparable from the MoU, which is not a legally binding agreement but reflects the political will of the two parties to strengthen mutual concrete cooperation” (Fatiguso, 2023). Additionally, over-reliance on the U.S. economic and security fronts is being debated. On the Taiwan front, caution is advised since a deal on semiconductors with Taipei would upset Beijing. If done with careful consideration, Italy would approach such a deal while in consultation with Beijing as well, reassuring it of Rome’s support for the “one-China” policy. At the same time, Italy would be able to defend its national interest further by ensuring long-term participation in projects aimed at developing critical technologies and safeguarding Rome from supply chain disruptions.
As such, in the spirit of guarding and pursuing national interests, pragmatism dictates that Italy maintains its hedging strategy with both Washington and Beijing. Maintaining a solid relationship with the U.S. is paramount to catering to Italy’s security concerns. Chinese involvement in the Mediterranean is fraught with risks, and adding another player to the fray would complicate the already fragile situation regarding Italy’s immediate neighborhood while forcing Rome to push back against Chinese assertiveness. Italy might use its de-risking and decoupling efforts as leverage in dealing with Washington and even Brussels – NATO and the EU. First, realizing that the long-term focus of the U.S. and NATO by extension, will be China and the Indo-Pacific, Italy will have to approach the securitization of the broader Mediterranean not through multilateral fora alone anymore but through bilateral or ad-hoc deals, within the EU framework of policy priorities relying on limited support from both the U.S. and NATO. Additionally, from an economic perspective, standing within the Western camp, beyond security supply chains for critical materials in the long term, would allow Italy to work towards healing its dysfunctional economy. Both COVID-19 and the Ukraine War resulted in a slowdown for the Italian economy, bringing the country’s public debt to above 150 per cent of GDP.  While Italy managed to avoid economic scarring and eventually made a full recovery from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine triggered a surge in energy prices, and the prospect of monetary policy tightening caused government bond yields to rise sharply. As Meloni remarked, referring to the impact of sanctions against Russia on the Italian economy, within the Western alliance, there are those who pay more, those who pay less, and those who gain. Hence de-risking with China could be used as leverage by the government with the objective of convincing the U.S. and other EU states to agree to the compensation fund Meloni herself has been pushing for in order to redistribute burdens equally and in case economic relations with China fall through.
Italy cannot yet afford to substitute China within its rooster of trade partners. However, while Italy is the only G7 country to have signed a BRI MoU, its economic relations with China are not the strongest within the panoply of Western and European powers. As such, as Meloni remarked, “it is possible to have good relations with Beijing, also in important domains, without them necessarily being part of an overall strategic plan.” (Sorgi, 2023). The major issue that the government will have to deal with will be convincing Beijing of this deal. Given China’s charm offensive across Europe advocating the separation of political issues from economic ones, as underscored by Liu Jianchao during his visit to Rome at the end of June (Senior China, 2023).  Beijing has been adamant regarding the importance it attaches to the BRI. The Italian government is, however, poised to respond in kind, signaling a firm commitment to truncate the MoU and instead solidify the U.S.-Italy alliance. Meloni’s discussion with Biden in July 2023 has solidified this perspective, showing Rome’s willingness to cool relations with Beijing. Following these developments, Foreign Minister Tajani’s September visit to China was de facto the initial diplomatic means to inform China of Italy’s choice to leave the BRI and an attempt to dampen repercussions. From the perspective of managing the exit effectively, it would not be surprising to see the eventuality reported by Giulia Pompili on II Foglio come to fruition. The Italian Foreign Ministry, which has yet to confirm this possibility, has reportedly been working on an alternative document to the MoU (Pompili, 2023). Alternatively, as it has been hinted to by Meloni during her meeting with Li Qiang on the sides of the G20, the BRI and the subsequent exit will be the foundation upon which future Italy-China relations will be based, in concomitance with the comprehensive strategic partnership signed between Beijing and Rome in 2004.  These visits and the alternative means to ensure the maintenance of a functioning relationship might serve as means to keep China from losing face and avoiding tensions. Sergio Mattarella’s visit to Beijing, scheduled for January 2024, can be seen as part of this process of slowly drifting away from China’s orbit while still attempting to offer Beijing a modicum of respect by maintaining a functioning relationship that does not revolve around the BRI, given the Initiative’s now incredibly charged renown. This could reduce political and economic fallouts with China to the minimum, help maintain a degree of cooperation and continue exploring and exploiting the potential of bilateral cooperation between Beijing and Rome.

Security Watch – BRICS: symptom of an emerging multipolar world ?,"The BRIC concept was firstlaunchedin 2001 by Jim O’Neill. The Goldman Sachs economist predicted that four emerging countries – Brazil, Russia, China and India – would replace the world’s six largest economies (the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) by 2050. The idea behind this analysis was that G7 countries’ageing populationsover the coming decades would lead to much more moderate economic growth over time. Giventhe size of their populations and workforce, these emerging countries would be likely to produce a much higher rate of productivity and growth than advanced economies.
These states have subsequently joined forces and coordinated their efforts to propose an alternative to the existing architecture of international organisations that emerged from the Bretton Woods agreements. On the side-lines of the United Nations General Assembly in 2006, Russia, China, Brazil and India formed aCooperation and Exchange Group. Together with South Africa since 2010, the five BRICS countries now account for almost aquarterof the world’s wealth. Collectively, the BRICS countries have a population of3.24 billionand combined national incomes of$26 billion.
China, the world’s second largest economy, is the BRICS’ principal banker. Without its economic leadership and financial guarantees, the BRICS would have no real organisational shape. BRICS-led financial institutions notably include the New Development Bank and the BRICS Reserve Fund. Six countries from Africa, the Middle East and Latin America are expected to join the organisation as new members next year, which is anticipated to strengthen the financial capabilities of the BRICS institutions – investments having beenlimitedfollowing the international sanctions imposed on Russia. With effect from January 2024, the BRICS-plus-six will account for more than30% of global GDP. The planned accession of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two of the world’s largest exporters of oil and gas, is expected to give the grouprelevance in the geopolitics of the global oil market.
Other Middle Eastern countries, in addition to Saudi Arabia, have distinguished themselves by their eagerness to apply the financial dictates of the BRICS, particularly in terms of “de-dollarisation“, even before applying for membership. On 14 May, the authorities in BaghdadbannedIraqis from trading in US dollars. The move is all the more surprising given that, since the American invasion of the country in March 2003, the Iraqi monetary system has been based on a fixed exchange rate between the Iraqi dinar and the US dollar. The significant slowdown in dollar deliveries to Iraq over recent months, aimed at combatingillicit transfers of dollarsfrom Iraq to Syria and Iran (which are subject to US sanctions), is alleged to be behind this decision. As a result, the Iraqi dinar has lost value, creating a particularly damaging financial situation for the Iraqi population.
The war in Ukraine has seen the international system take a further step towards a more multipolar and multicultural world. It has confirmed the desire of the rising powers of the international system to develop strategies of differentiation from the West. Since the Russian aggression of 24 February 2022, India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) have shown their determination to keep theirdistance, or equidistance, from the two belligerents, Moscow and Kyiv, as well as from the latter’s Western allies. Despite the fact that Russia has violated the essential principles of the United Nations Charter, the IBSA have multiplied their signs of defiance: rejection of Western sanctions, calls for a ceasefire in current positions even though Moscow currently controls a fifth of Ukrainian territory, and purchases of Russian oil and gas.
While Brazil, India and South Africa refuse to align themselves with Western positions, China has embarked on a much broader challenge to become the uncontested power of the international system. A few weeks before the Kremlin decided to launch its aggression against Ukraine, Xi Jinping signed asixteen-page joint declarationwith Vladimir Putin on the side-lines of the Beijing Olympics aimed at overthrowing the liberal international order. Since then, Beijing has continued to verbally defy the rules-based system in a bellicose manner. This year, the Chinese President submitted a new foreign policy doctrine to the National People’s Congress, breaking with China’s previous strategy and summed up by the expression “Dare to fight“. This new doctrine reflects China’s new, assertive strategy on the international stage and contrasts with its traditional tone of caution and discretion. According toXi Jinping, the world has entered a “new era”, full of turbulence and challenges that the old system of global governance, too elitist and dependent on American financial institutions, is unable to manage. This is why Beijing is presentingalternativesto the existing models, in terms of economic development and regional and global security.
But a watershed moment may loom which could have an impact on BRICS cohesion. This shake-up is likely to occur between India and China. New Delhi does not want to leave Beijing free to reconfigure the BRICS as it pleases and assert itself as the leader of the South. India still remembers thestrategic defeatit incurred at the hands of China on the Himalayan plain in 1962, enabling Beijing to control a large part of Ladakh, which it renamed “Aksai Chin”. The effects of this defeat are still being felt today, asdeadly clashesoccurred in Ladakh’s Galwan valley in 2020, costing the lives of twenty Indian soldiers and four Chinese. Over the past three years, the two armies have considerably fortified their positions, with more than60,000 soldiersstationed on either side of the Line of Control along with a large amount of infrastructure, including the construction by the Chinese of at least four new villages in Arunachal Pradesh, over which Beijingclaims sovereignty. A dozen sites in Arunachal Pradesh – towns, rivers and mountains – have been renamed in Chinese and Tibetan. Politically, negotiations are blocked by Beijing’s military intransigence, giving often rise totense exchangesbetween the two delegations.
Anticipate over the short to medium term Sino-Indian relations to remain at odds. India wants existing institutions to be reformed so that the developing world is better represented in them; its involvement in the BRICS is part of this perspective. China, for its part, notably aims to dethrone the US dollar in order to escape the extraterritoriality of US law, and to replace the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank with the New Development Bank and the BRICS Reserve Fund in the economic development of the countries of the Global South. These two institutions require no political reciprocation on the part of the recipient governments.
The BRICS expansion project has also exposed the points of disagreement between Beijing and New Delhi. The question of enlargement is a critical point to the Chinese because they see in it the possibility of opening up the organisation to other countries and creating a counterweight to the pro-Western institutions that exist today. The recent move to enlarge the organisation is therefore a real victory for the Chinese President, who was its most ardent supporter. As far back as March 2017, his Minister for External Relations, Wang Yi, had been a vocaladvocateof Xi Jinping’s proposal to expand the BRICS organisation to include other major developing economies, under the name “BRICS-Plus”. India did not want the BRICS to take anoverly anti-Western turn: the future membership of Venezuela and Iran in January 2024, both subject to US sanctions, testifies China’s desire to make the group a platform against the US-led international liberal order.
The growing heterogeneity of interests between the two largest BRICS economies could therefore diminish the group’s ability to take concrete action and become a real success in defending the Global South. It will be interesting to see how this fragmentation of interests will affect the cohesion and effectiveness of the BRICS as an organisation over the medium and long term.

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Absence from G20 Summit Raises Questions About U.S.-China Relations,"The recently concluded 18th G20 summit made headlines not only for its global economic discussions but also for the conspicuousabsenceof Chinese President Xi Jinping. This marked President Xi’s first absence from the G20 since 2012, when the summit was held in Los Cabos, Mexico.
The absence of President Xi was particularly notable as last year’sG20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, saw a significant breakthrough in U.S.-China relations when President Joe Biden engaged in face-to-face talks with President Xi, heralded as a promising step towards reestablishing dialogue between the two major powers. Anticipation had been building in the lead-up to this year’s summit that the two leaders might meet again, possibly leading to a “Xi-Biden Summit” in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in the United States.
However, President Xi’s absence has cast doubt on the prospects of such a meeting, leaving observers wondering about China’s motivations for this decision.
China’s Perspective on U.S.-China Relations
One key factor behind President Xi’s absence could be China’s perception of U.S.-China relations. Although the “four no’s and one no intention” consensus was reached during their previous meeting, China has grown increasingly sceptical of the United States’ commitment to these principles. Despite statements from U.S. officials indicating a desire to maintain normal economic and trade relations and communicate with China, recent actions such as approving arms sales to Taiwan, providing military financing to Taiwan, and involvement in issues related to Tibet and the South China Sea have left China feeling uncertain about the U.S. approach. Beijing believes that the Biden administration’s China strategy is marked by a contradictory mix of “competition” and “management and control of competition,” undermining trust in the usefulness of a “Xi-Biden Summit.”
China’s Perspective on the G20 Summit
Another significant factor in President Xi’s absence from the G20 summit is China’s perception of the event itself. China views the G20 as a platform dominated by a few countries whereby genuine global economic cooperation is lacking. Instead, participants tend to focus on their individual interests, with minimal consensus achieved. This perception has led more developing countries to question the effectiveness of international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have not adequately addressed their development needs. In this context, China appears to be prioritising the BRICS grouping as a mechanism for expanding its influence within the Global South, which aligns better with its interests compared to the West-centred G20.
APEC Meeting Controversy
Additionally, President Xi’s decision not to attend the APEC meeting in San Francisco in November can be attributed to a dispute between the United States and China regarding the participation of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR, John Lee Ka-chiu. The Biden administration’s refusal to allow Lee to attend due tosanctionshas led to strong condemnation from China. Beijing asserts that the host country of APEC has a responsibility to allow all member representatives to participate, and the U.S. sanctions on Chinese personnel, including Lee, constitute a violation of international norms and APEC rules. This dispute has further strained U.S.-China relations, raising questions about the future of bilateral cooperation.
As President Xi’s absence from these international gatherings continues to raise eyebrows, the world watches with keen interest to see how these developments will impact the complex relationship between China and the United States.","September 30, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-new-normal-la-nouvelle-normalite-%e6%96%b0%e5%b8%b8%e6%85%8b-chinese-president-xi-jinpings-absence-from-g20-summit-raises-questions-about-u-s-china-relations/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,NewsRoom
Unpacking Haiti’s Crisis: UN Military Mission Dilemma,"In the past year, discussions have intensified within the United Nations regarding the possibility of deploying a UN military mission to the Caribbean island of Haiti. The country is currently facing a profound humanitarian crisis exacerbated by political instability, following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse on July 7, 2021. In particular, the purpose of a military intervention under the auspices of the United Nations would be to support Haitian law enforcement in their struggle against powerful local gangs that control extensive areas of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and critical infrastructure essential to the island’s economy. However, past military failures and Haitian opposition to foreign intervention may render such a scenario unlikely.
Haiti’s Plea for International Aid Amid Escalating Crisis
In early October 2022, Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henryemphasizedthe urgent need for military assistance from the international community in the Caribbean nation. His plea was supported by compelling reasons, reflecting the pressing need to restore security and stability in the country. This urgency was further exacerbated by the blockade of its main supply port by a coalition of gangs, resulting in a paralysis of commercial activities and essential services at that time. The request from the de facto government was subsequently endorsed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. During this time, Guterres referred to a “specialized armed force” capable of supporting the Haitian National Police in liberating and protecting the country’s essential infrastructure.
Meanwhile, during the first six months of 2023, the situation in Haiti has not improved significantly. Criminal groups haveexpanded their controlto nearly the entire metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, a worrisome expansion compared to December 2022 when criminal groups controlled 60% of the area. This, along with other alarming figures regarding internal security in the country, has recently prompted Antonio Guterres toreiterate, during a visit to Haiti in early July, the need for a specialized armed force authorized by the United Nations Security Council.
Challenges to International Intervention in Haiti’s Crisis
As of now, however, an agreement at the United Nations headquarters has not yet been reached. The United States, which in October 2022 drafted a United Nations Security Council resolution encouraging “the immediate deployment of a multinational rapid-action force” is currently reevaluating its strategy. The Biden administration has expressed reluctance to lead such a multinational force from the outset,hopinginstead that Canada would take the lead, given the strong diplomatic ties between the two Francophone countries. However, the Canadian Prime Minister has publicly expressed reservations about military intervention in Haiti, stating that such an operation “hasn’t worked to create long-term stability for Haiti” in the past. The lack of willingness among countries to risk their military contingents in a delicate urban warfare scenario where the enemy can easily blend in with the civilian population is undoubtedly one of the reasons why an agreement has not yet been reached.
At the same time, amid violent protests that have rocked several cities in Haiti, it is evident that a significant portion of the local population strongly opposes the hypothetical United Nations military intervention. Themassive proteststhat occurred during October 2022, were primarily a vehement opposition to Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s request for foreign military assistance to address the gang crisis in the country. Demonstrators not only called for Henry’s immediate resignation but also expressed strong dissent regarding any foreign involvement in Haiti’s internal affairs, as evidenced by the fact that the protests alsotargetedthe Canadian Embassy in Port-au-Prince.
This resistance to external intervention has its roots in the nation’s historical experiences. Previous foreign interventions on the island, especially the United Nations peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH, have left a legacy of distrust and dissatisfaction among the Haitian population. The people of Haiti seem determined to chart their own path to a political solution to the crisis, with a priority being the removal of the unpopular and, by many accounts, illegitimate government led by Ariel Henry. Henry assumed the role of interim prime minister with the support of the international community following the assassination of Jovenel Moïse.
The current government’s unpopularity largely proceed from the prolonged postponement of legislative elections, which haven’t occurred in the country since 2016. Despite this, Prime Minister Henry governs by decree and has announced his intention to stay in power until presidential elections take place. In this sense, the current government continues to be legitimized by the international community, whojustifythis support on the grounds that Ariel Henry was chosen as prime minister of Haiti by President Jovenel Moïse days before Moïse was assassinated. Nevertheless, the unpopularity of the current government would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the effectiveness of any external military intervention on the island.
Exploring Regional Cooperation for Haiti’s Way Forward
Haiti, a nation facing a complex scenario of political instability, economic crisis, and natural disasters, finds itself at a crucial juncture in its history. Confronted with this multifaceted crisis, there are several options to consider, each challenging the notion that a United Nations military mission can entirely resolve the multitude of issues plaguing the country.
In this regard, it is essential to emphasize the importance of regional cooperation, particularly through organizations like the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). CARICOM has been actively engaged in seeking peaceful solutions to the crisis in Haiti, advocating for dialogue and diplomacy over military intervention. This is demonstrated by ameetingheld in Haiti last July, where the CARICOM Eminent Persons Group (EPG), political members of the current Haitian government, and civil society came together. This provided an opportunity to build greater trust among the parties, a crucial element for embarking on a long-term dialogue process capable of addressing sensitive issues such as the formulation of a new executive and power-sharing. Regional solidarity and diplomacy can offer a more nuancedand culturally sensitive approach to addressing Haiti’s challenges.
Addressing security concerns in Haiti is undoubtedly crucial, but the idea that a United Nations military mission alone can solve all the problems is overly simplistic. As mentioned, a multifaceted security approach should first involve the creation, facilitated through regional dialogue, of a consensus-based transitional government with shared executive power. Only then can an effective reform of local law enforcement, disarmament of criminal gangs, and the strengthening of the police be pursued to ensure lasting security. It’s only at this later stage that a specialized international force could be deployed to facilitate such strengthening.
The crisis in Haiti demands a holistic approach, in which diplomatic efforts and regional cooperation take precedence over military intervention. Only through a combination of these approaches can Haiti hope to achieve lasting peace, stability, and prosperity.
What role do you think economic sanctions could play in pressuring the Haitian government and opposition to come together and form a government of national unity? Are sanctions an effective tool in addressing the Haitiancrisis?
Given Haiti’s complex history, culture, and geographical challenges, do you believe it’s realistic to expect the country to achieve stability without substantial and sustained international assistance?
Building upon the idea of a long-term, capable U.N. presence in Haiti, how can the international community ensure that the mission remains flexible and responsive to the evolving circumstances and needs of the Haitian people over time?

Berlusconi’s Populist Modus Operandi Will Live On,"In June this year, Silvio Berlusconi, the four-time Prime Minister of Italy and businessman, passed away. However, his political legacy continues to live on through his brand of populism and hisForza Italiapolitical party. As a politician, Berlusconi came to dominate the political scene at a time when the old socialist and communist inclinations deteriorated following the fall of the Berlin Wall and soon after the Soviet Union.
The political model Berlusconi ushered in is one most notably replicated during the premiership of Boris Johnson in the UK,a figure who openly admired the Italian leader; inHungary with Viktor Orban; and in the United States under the infamous leadership ofDonald Trump, a figure that like Berlusconi had accumulated a vast personal fortune prior to entering politics.
An article from June of this yeardescribes the commonalities of Berlusconi, Johnson, and Trump as “opportunistic, hard-right populist-nationalist politics, spiced with braggadocio and sickly charm, to dazzle, woo and bamboozle voters”. Berlusconi’s model managed to merge together entertainment with politics. He mastered the former by association with the media empire which led to his vast fortune. Following a successful career in construction, Berlusconi entered the world of media by setting up the cable television company, TeleMilano, Italy’s first private TV channel exclusively for the apartments built by his construction firm.
Two years after founding TeleMilano, the success of the company allowed Berlusconi to form his first media group, Mediaset. If his private cable TV company provided the foundations of Berlusconi’s media success,then Mediaset was the construction that made it happen. The media group, which soon became a single national network in effect, proved to be the first serious challenge to the monopolistic grip of the state-owned Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI). At the time, RAI was the only media organisation permitted to have a national network. But through a loophole in the national legislation, Berlusconi out-manoeuvred a ban and created the first private national network by purchasing local television stations,although running the same program on each one.
As consumerism and commercialisation came to fruition in Italian society, Berlusconi’s media business model took on these fresh developments whilst moving away from the traditional cinematic focus on local Italian produce to imported films from the US, creating fresh demand. As such, Berlusconi’s televised content, described as “catchier, funnier, and flashier” than previous Italian television, helped to create a new Italian culture.
However, Berlusconi’s questionable business conduct eventually caught up with him, andfrom this came his initial incentive to enter politics. Faced with legal challenges that could have led to jail time, Berlusconi sought political office in an attempt to change legislation in his favour. Alongside this, Berlusconi’s rise to power also came at a time of political crisis in Italy with the Mani Pulite, or clean hands, in 1992, which saw the demise of the post-war and post-fascist First Republic. From this crisis came Berlusconi’s justification for entering politics.
The Mani Pulite was a nationwide investigation into political corruption which resulted in the arrests of numerous politicians and industrial leaders, including the 45th Prime Minister of Italy, Bettino Craxi, a personal friend of Berlusconi. Due to the deep and widespread impact of Mani Pulite, all four parties within the 1992 coalition, known as the Pentapartito, disappeared at various points.
The Pentapartito included the Italian Socialist Party, the Democratic Christian Party, The Italian Democratic Socialist Party, and the Italian Liberal Party. The Democratic Party of the Left, the post-communist evolution of the Italian Communist Party, was one of the only surviving national parties and was widely expected to win the 1994 general election. It was this expectation that Berlusconi justified his 1993 political entrance andthe creation of the first Forza Italia, stating that only could prevent a communist takeover of Italywhilst boosting Italy’s economy with US-style free market economic policies.
Following his political entrance, Berlusconi obtained a loyal political following within Forza Italia across the nation and in the 1994 general election, obtained 43% of the popular vote and entered a coalition with Lega Nord. From this Berlusconi became Prime Minister for the first time, but would go on to lose in 1996, before re-entering in 2001 and serving a full term as Prime Minister to 2006, and finally serving from 2008 to 2011,a term in which he survived 53 confidence votes. Alongside this, Berlusconi served as a member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2001, and between 2019 and 2022.
Throughout his political career, Berlusconi’s ability to merge entertainment and politics became one of his key strategies in maintaining support, as well asselling his political image through the skilful use of mass media, a strategy learnt from his media empire. In a style later replicated across the globe, Berlusconi utilised commercial advertising to produce emotive political campaigning, whilst using jokes as part of his image and in political debates, akin to Boris Johnson. Once in power, Berlusconi amplified his critical stance against the state by targeting institutions, such as utilising his previous legal troubles which led him to enter politics amongst other claims of corruption and tax fraud in arguing that such claimsare examples of a legal conspiracy against not only him but the freedom of Italy. Akin to Donald Trump.
These factors accumulate to define what critics call Berlusconismo, and this is arguably the ultimate legacy of Berlusconi. It is also one which won him vocal fans across the continent, including a young Boris Johnson when he was editor at The Spectator and yet to become a Conservative Member of Parliament. In 2003,Johnson visited Berlusconiin Italy to conduct an interview for a profile piece in the Spectator. In assessing whether the Italian Prime Minister was politically a “good thing”, Johnson’s answer was an “unambiguous yes”. His praise went on to include Berlusconi’s humorous character, stating that it is hard not to be charmed by a man who makes jokes about the EU, whilst his style contains something “heroic” and “hilariously imperial” within it.
Two years after writing the Berlusconi article, Johnson announced his candidacy as a Conservative for the Uxbridge parliamentary seat in west London. He had lied to The Spectator, with whom he took on the role of Editor on the understanding he would not enter politics. Such opportunism is arguably a key moment in whatsome critics call the Berlusconifying of the UK.
Johnson, as well as Trump, further demonstrates the absorption of Berlusconismo by making national political parties into personal parties.Where Berlusconi relied on his personality and the use of mass media to win votes, such politicians would later follow suit. Berlusconi’s use of stunts to create spectacles and push the personalisation of politics further created inspiration, from Johnson’s bulldozer to Trump’s infamous and numerous Twitter performances.
Whilst such politicians may longer be in positions of power, it is arguably the long-term effects they create that are their true impacts, as opposed to ensuring effective political rule. With both the UK and the US facing general elections in 2024, the impact of Johnson in the UK has unquestionably stained the reputation of the ruling Conservative Party, whilst Trump, in true Berlusconi style, is pushing for a second term amidst considerable legal troubles.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s periphery: Lampedusa Becomes Ground Zero In Migrant Crisis,"Within 24 hours,8500 migrantsreached the island of Lampedusa by taking199 boats. In a week,11,560 peoplearrived in Lampedusa.Online, this arrival has been characterized as an invasion due to the number of migrants arriving without permission is larger than the island’s permanent population. In 2021, the population of Lampedusa was just under6500. Lampedusa is the closest point of Italy to Africa, only110 kilometersfrom Tunisia.
President of the European Commission,Ursula Von Der Leyenvisited Lampedusa to reassure Italian prime Minister Giorgia meloni that the European Union would support Italy. This would include the transfer of asylum seekers voluntarily to other EU member states. Whether European Union member states will willingly help out however is yet to be seen. Several member states have already appeared to be taking a stance against accepting any more migrants from Italy.
Italy’s first female Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni included stoppingillegal immigrationas one of her top priorities when she campaigned in the last election. Making a campaign promise however is very different from actually following through and delivering results. Meloni while campaigning mentioned usingnaval blockadesnumerous times in order to stop ships from arriving yet did not do so, angering Italians which is obvious from their comments on posts on Meloni’s profile on X. Meloni’s party, Fratelli d’Italia received34,2 percentof the vote from the islands of Lampedusa and Linosa, the highest percentage of any political party. Besides frequently being an arrival point of illegal immigration, Residents of Lampedusa will watch Meloni closely due to having trusted her to lead the nation. So far127,000 peoplehave illegally arrived in Italy since January 1st, double the number of migrants during the same time frame in 2022. For those who have valid asylum claims, arriving in this matter would then not be classified as illegal but it has yet to be seen how valid this is for those who have arrived this year.
People have attempted to claim that Meloni has changed her position on immigration due to looking for425,000immigrants from non-EU nations to fill specific jobs. These critics however ignore the clear difference between immigration of workers with permission and the skills necessary for open jobs and people attempting to enter Italy without permission. Part of this may be due to attempts to paint everyone arriving illegally as asylum seekers, despite asylum status requiring specific conditions in order to be granted. The desire for more economic opportunities is not an acceptable motive for someone to be granted asylum. An example is immigrants from Kyrgyzstan being granted visas to work in the island region of Sardegna in order to help with horse breeding and goat and sheep cheese production.
Franceand Germany have both made it clear that migrants that arrived on Lampedusa will not be accepted in either nation.Pope Francisis expected to make comments on France refusing to be more welcoming, yet this is easier said than done given the EU member state’s struggles the past few years. Similar to nations around the world, France has struggled economically due to lock downs attempting to stop the spread of Covid-19, and inflation that resulted from the pandemic along with the invasion of Ukraine which saw EU nations scrambling to find alternative energy sources other than Russia.
Germany on the other hand made it clear it wouldnot accept more migrants, despite originally agreeing to previously. When France and Germany refuse to help with receiving migrants, resentment grows in Southern EU member states who continue to be burdened by illegal immigration. This is because Italy was nothonoring its obligationto register all immigrants that arrive there, as required by the Dublin procedure. This allows migrants to be returned to the EU member state of arrival later on if the member state the migrants traveled to desire to do so. As Italy correctly has pointed out however, this unjustly burdens border member states, who tend to be less economically developed than nations such as Germany.
Apart from the migration crisis, Italy has been struggling with other issues that have been weighing heavily on the nation for years. The government still needs to continue to work to reduce thenational debt, improve economic conditions for citizens which has sent thefertility ratein a death spiral and an increase once again inemigration, and finally also address theregional economic inequalitythat continues to persist. Every euro Italy must spend on processing asylum applications and deporting those who do not have the right to remain in Italy or the European Union is a euro deprived from helping Italian citizens. Hours spent by Italian politicians on curbing illegal immigration is also time that these politicians will never get back in an attempt to solve the aforementioned important domestic issues.
Wealthier nations in the European Union need to step up and do their part in responding to the migration crisis. The European Union also needs to do more to support member states with processing new arrivals and deporting migrants who do not qualify for asylum. While it is understandable many people may desire to immigrate to the European Union for more economic opportunities, the European Union and national governments need to prioritize their own citizens. If they do not, no other government will. Poverty continues to be a challenge throughout the bloc and these citizens cannot be ignored for those who chose to attempt to immigrate to the European Union in an illegal manner.

Analyzing The New Delhi G20 Summit: How India Emerged Victorious,"The Group of 20 Summit, since its beginning in 1999, has set the onus for global leaders to unite on economic, health, and political challenges plaguing the international stage. For its 18th rendition, the G20 Summit was held in New Delhi, led by India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and attended by 19 countries and the EU. On its agenda this year, the summit included the topics of food and energy security, climate change, economic aid to developing countries, and the socioeconomic influences of the war in Ukraine.
From September 9th to the 10th, and joined by an extensive list of global leaders, the 2023 G20 Summit covered the vast array of topics it set out to discuss and ultimately, ended with a joint communique – the New Delhi Declaration. Gathering under the theme, “One Earth, One Family, and One Future, championing the Sanskrit phrase for “the world is one family” the 2023 G20 Summit aimed to sculpt a pathway of unity and cooperation for the foreseeable future.
One of the crucial results of the Summit was the common consent to embrace further technological innovations for developing nations. Throughout Modi’s Presidency, the focus on digital public infrastructure (or DPI), has been imperative to the states’ development. Controlled by the government and utilized to deliver both public and private services to society as needed, India found great strength in this system throughout the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, which aided in vaccine rollout and cash transfers. The delegates of the G20 Summit, intrigued by this novel development, began to open conversations on its effects, particularly, how DPI use in nations with less than satisfactory levels of infrastructure can guarantee economic relevancy.
This also translated to technological solutions for combatting climate change. Ultimately, while the dialogue surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has always been approached with caution, the importance of creating DPI and AI that is inclusive and respectful to all forms of human rights protections was highlighted. As a result, negotiations with New Delhi to begin further advancement of the digital sector through mechanisms of designated and effective governance for ‘good and for all,’ took place amongst eight nations.
Within the same vein of progressive delegation, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudia Arabia, shared a handshake with President Joe Biden of the United States, to issue their announcement of a new project: to create a shipping corridor that stretches from India to the Middle East and Europe. While there are no concrete plans as of late, the idea is to set up rail and port links between the nations, as a form of advancing new trade pathways for further economic cooperation. Formulated as a plan to offset or counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the corridor aims to include several Middle Eastern nations, linking the European Union, as a way to not only increase trade but further develop avenues for both, digital integration and the provision of crucial energy resources.
Prime Minister Modi’s aim for the event was not only, to display his leadership, but conduct a summit that brought the nation’s initiatives together. However, the absence of a couple of crucial players posed inquiries about the geopolitical implications of the 2023 Summit. Both, Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, were missing in attendance.
While Putin could not afford to attend for the risk of being arrested upon leaving Russia, Xi Jinping’s absence was the first in a summit since its beginning in 2008. Understood as an intentional move, analysts have discussed the reasoning for this play, believed to be well-awaited after growing tensions between India and China over a border dispute. Some have viewed this as an “intentional snub,” while others have focused on how this lack of display can work in India’s favor, boosting Modi’s reputation and ultimately, placing India in the lead on the Global South. This gap, however, also created room for Modi to announce in his opening speech, the inauguration of the African Union to the Group of 20.
The African Union, a member delegation that connects the 55 states of the continent, led by the chair, Azali Assoumani, has taken an official seat as a permanent member of the G20. Showing onlookers Modi’s ability to further bring world leaders together, this move simultaneously gives a voice to the entire African bloc on some of the most pressing issues on the geopolitical scale. Representing a continent bountiful in resources for battling climate change and spacious in free trade, the AU’s addition to the G20 not only, provides a necessary power to an entire continent that has otherwise been on the outskirts of conversation, but continues to bridge the gap between East and West, North and South. The move from Modi to officially appoint the African Union on this scale is seen as a positive, and ultimately imperative move, for collective action to tackle the issues plaguing the globe.
The final outcome of the summit, resounded in a joint communique touching upon the war in Ukraine. In stark opposition to the statement made in last year’s Bali Declaration, the 2023 joint declaration issued by the G20 nations softened their stance with regard to the Russia-Ukraine war. The joint communique backed Ukraine, calling for respect of  “territorial integrity and sovereignty” and stating that “the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.” By emphasizing the suffering of the Ukrainian people, it was agreed by all parties that territory cannot be seized by force, ultimately condemning the actions of war occurring in Ukraine. However, there was a distinct avoidance of placing direct criticism on Russian aggression.  The turn of phrase and the concentration towards intolerable acts of war instead, evidently evaded placing responsibility on Russia. This toned-down language resulted in a less than enthusiastic reproach by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, stating it was “nothing to be proud of.”
Despite this, other diplomats considered it to be a successful outcome, as it secured political agreement from otherwise, opposing groups. Having anticipated Russian disproval of any public incrimination or denouncement, the declaration reflected support for a comprehensive peace and received positive response and agreement by all nations. Considered a massive feat and having demonstrated Modi’s capacity for inclusive leadership, the harmonious joint statement on Ukraine signified an achievement for India. Nevertheless, such a weakening stance on Russia’s actions additionally sheds light on the changing stance within Western media and politics, as countries appear to be shifting focus and sentiment, begging the question of where the West may stand in a continued role within the controversy.
As the Summit came to a close after two long days, Narendra Modi appeared to establish his rightful spot on the international stage, and the “Global South” emerged with a win. With the most comprehensive agenda outcome to date, the 2023 summit placed India as a leading power in providing solutions to global challenges, established the Global South at the focal center of global governance, and ultimately restored a certain amount of faith in the processes of multilateralism.
In having all twenty members, including Russia, agree on a statement in reference to the war in Ukraine, as well as various interests to grow and revamp progressive projects on climate change as well as energy and trade policy, the 2023 G20 Summit has ultimately been viewed as a success. As the conference ended with agreements made and projects proposed, passing the baton onward to Brazil for the following year, the international community at large will take note of the changes to come, awaiting the 2024 G20 Summit.

(Analysis) Fascism for the Third Millennium in Latin America,"Desperados Division, Rock Fascista, and Fascism for the Third Millennium
In November of 2022 aFascist Rock Concertin Mexico City, The Empire Strikes Back, publicly demonstrated the growing re-emergence of trans-Atlantic links with Fascism in Latin America. Attendance, in the grand scheme of things, was relatively low, allegedly several hundred, but it represented a critical point of contact between the established Italian and Spanish Nationalist Rock scenes and the burgeoning Mexican Nationalist Rock genre. As per social media, this was only the most recent of multiple Fascist Rock shows, which included some of the most widely known Italian and Spanish acts such asBronson. The emergence of this connection demonstrates that culturally and politically, the Latin American Nationalist Scene is undergoing a significant evolution. The Empire Strikes Back concert demonstrates this shift in Mexico and Latin America towards Fascist Rock as a stand-in for youth culture and away from the traditional clerical associations of Latin American Fascism. To better understand this evolution, it is necessary to briefly examine the history of Fascist Rock, Fascism since the Second World War, and Fascism in Latin America.
Following World War II, in both Europe and Latin America, political struggle was transposed onto the cultural field. Nationalist music and youth culture were utilized to provide unifying slogans, ideas, and function in the place of more traditional means of political organizing such as political parties. In Europe, this is best exemplified byCamp Hobbitin Italy which served as one of the most clearly observable points of ideological development and dissemination across the Neofascist milieu. Today, Fascist Rock has been influential in the Italian and Spanish Far Right, serving as abridgebetween older generations of militants andyoung dissidents. It has helped communicate multiple changes in orientation and style that have reflected broader political changes. Fascist Rock arose in the 1980s asRock Against Communismin the UK and in countries such as Italy, Spain, and Latin America hardcore or alternative groups such asZetazeroalfa– a major inspiration and point of reference forCasapound Italiarose to prominence in the early 2000s.
As Casapound has expanded its reach in Italy and its brand/image internationally, its “Fascism for the Third Millennium” has inspired similar groups and organizations such as Hogar Social, Cossack House, and other contemporary Fascist organizations across the world. While Fascism for the Third Millennium has an overt dimension, it is helpful to think of it as a style both of action and aesthetics that help to differentiate Casapound and other Fascist groups from more traditional organizations or parties. Rupe Tarpea the label behind, Zetazeroalfa, has evolved in time with Neofascist ideology and promoted Bronson which serves as a link between multiple groups, genres, and tendencies within the Neofascist milieu. It is no coincidence that Bronson played the “Tequila Sunrise” show in Mexico City in 2022, demonstrating the growing nexus between Fascism for the Third Millennium and Latin America and serving as the ambassador of Fascism for the Third Millennium. Tequila Sunrise was another show organized by Desperados Division which also organized The Empire Strikes Back though it seemingly has not been covered publicly.
Before delving into the present, it is important to briefly establish the long and often obscure history of Fascism in Southern Europe and Latin America. After the capitulation of the Axis Powers, Fascists for the moment suffered from absolute ideological disorientation. In Germany, the total defeat and subsequent partition into zones of occupation ensured that those committed Fascists who remained did so without overtly expressing their ideals. In Italy, where the defeat was not as total as Nazi Germany, the surviving Fascist veterans and ideologues were in a radically changed world but relatively united as a political force. This unity was eroded slightly by the emergence of the post-war Italian parties – the Christian Democrats (DC), Communists (PCI), and Socialists (PSI). Surviving Fascists entered all of the above, with some repubblichini (adherents to the Repubblica Sociale Italiano) entering the PCI and PSI in a political evolution similar to some Nazi veterans in East Germany entering the National Democratic Party of Germany. Some young Fascists continued the armed struggle for Fascism immediately byforming organizations[ITALIAN ONLY]such as Legione Nera or the journal “Imperium”,  but themajorityof RSI veterans coalesced around the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI) which came to be the fourth party of Italy.  While there would remain a vibrant current of revolutionary thought and action on both the Right and Left, the extra-parliamentary extremes would always remain relatively marginal despite some sensationalarmed actions.
Elsewhere in Europe, Fascism survived in more clandestine environments and underwent drastic ideological mutations. Francis Parker Yockey, an American Lawyer at the Nuremberg trials, founded the Fascist International. Yockey himself authoredImperiuma text that serves as a critical reference point for some elements of the English-speaking Far Right. He can be considered the father of a current of thought which combined traditional Nazism with non-National Socialist thinkers. While at the time this was limited to Spengler who already had some following from among the milieu surrounding the NSDAP, over time this syncretic current would expand to include bodies of work such as Hindu mythology or esotericism. Germanic Fascism in ideological disarray is matched by Italian Neofascism assimilating the thought ofJulius Evolaas a central component largely motivated by successive youth movements within the Neofascist milieu.
The defeat of the Axis powers in Europe in some ways freed Fascism from its two necessary reference points the Kingdom of Italy and the German Reich. While there were many Philo-Fascist organizations in Latin America from the 1920s-1945, it was only after the end of the Second World War that the first major original thinker associated with contemporary Neofascism arose from the region,Miguel Serrano. Serrano was a distinguished poet, diplomat, and student of esotericism, with a secondary dimension of being the key proponent of Esoteric Hitlerism. This nebulous belief system is partially elaborated through his textNos, the Book of Resurrectionas well as through the  Hindu-Nazism ofSavitri Deviin the Lighting and the Sun. Both posit Hitler as a quasi-divine or mystical manifestation of the will and outline, in line with some tendencies within the thought of Julius Evola, a cosmic struggle between the Solar/Uranian Masculine and Warlike Race with the Lunar/Telluric Race.
Because of its marginal position in relation to national politics, Neofascism in Italy and Esoteric Hitlerism were able to delve into subjects such as the Solar versus Lunar Cosmic Conflict, Traditionalism, andfantasy literature. In Latin America in the immediate post-war era, parties and individuals influenced by or who supported Fascism had a fundamentally different ideological trajectory both as a result of the regional context and the roots of regional “Fascist” thought.
Fascism in Latin America – A helpful word?
Unlike Europe, Latin America had a distinctly Catholic current of thought due to the influence of French reactionary thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre and Charles Maurras which minimized the influence of both German National Socialism and Italian Fascism. This is most observable in Argentina and Nacionalismo which saw successive iterations of reactionary catholic intellectuals develop centers and vehicles of ideological struggle such as the journal Cabildo before finally achieving a share of national power with the Junta established in1976.
Across the region in Brazil and in Mexico, similar struggles took place between the secular and religious – specifically the catholic revolutionary right. TheGold Shirtsfor instance, were always a minor player compared with the larger milieu surrounding the Cristeros and post-Cristero Catholic nationalists; Brazilian Integralism, which enjoyed the largest degree of membership and public influence across the region, also conceptualized itself as a fundamentally spiritual manifestation. In Argentina throughout the 20th century, as a result of the influence of the Catholic – Reactionary intellectuals affiliated with Argentine Nacionalismo enjoyed a relationship with the state that was limited to cultural influence and some ministerial positions. Nacionalista figures with a relatively modern example of Father Julio Meinvielle and conceptualized the rule of the Junta as the restoration of the catholic order, demonstrating the centrality of Catholicism in comparison with the Romanticist/Volkish National Socialism and the Statist Fascism.
Because of these difficulties and the position of “Fascist” movements in Latin America as largely reactionary and lacking the revolutionary impetus of the PNF or NSDAP, it is inappropriate to talk of a genuinely Latin AmericanFascismunless we accept that Fascism has come to signify far more than the body of ideas animating theMarch on Rome in 1922. Fascism in the current discourse can be viewed as a nebulous but interconnected milieu composed of a variety of radical ideologies and groups that have common themes of rejecting liberalism and materialism. This allows us to examine Fascism, Neofascism, National Socialism, Falangism, and others as manifestations of the same weltanschauung as related concepts despite potential political conflicts or inconsistencies. Accepting Fascism as a loose term that defines a broad worldview instead of a discrete ideology and system allows us to discuss Latin American Fascism as well as meaningfully engage with the categorization on the part of a multitude of actors of various post-war and contemporary regimes as Fascistic. In the absence of this adjustment, we would be limited to discussing some minor political parties with limited influence and flirting with theUr-Fascismof Umberto Ecco which, while potentially a useful starting point, lacks the specificity to help us.
Latin America does not neatly fit into the categories of right – left. Many movements can be classified as “Fascist” or “Fascist inspired” only in that they espouse a worldview that refutes elements of either liberal or socialist modernity. Common examples often include the figure of Juan Peron and Argentina but some of the military governments of the 1970s-1980s, the Cuban Revolution, Bolivarianism, and Colombian Paramilitarism, all could be understood as simultaneously Fascist/Fascist Inspired or Socialist/Socialist Inspired depending on which facet an observer examined. The ideological eccentricities of the latter half of the 20th century, the necessity to define ideologies and regimes in relation to the two principal world powers, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has led to a loose definition of Fascist or Socialist that often overlapped in the so-called “third world”. This was further complicated by the Sino-Soviet split, with the People’s Republic of China defining regimes allied with the USSR as “Hitlerite” and the United States recognizing movements such as the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot as legitimate authorities. The BolivianSocialistFalangeprovides a perfect symbolic example of the contradictions within revolutionary movements and difficulties in the region, demonstrating that the paradigm of right and left is not necessarily a helpful lens in Latin America.
As an arena of great power competition, Latin America has also had multiple Fascist or para-Fascist organizations such as the Alianza Anticomunista de Argentina (AAA) with established links to international Fascist organizations or non-fascist intelligence services. A prime example of this relationship is the career ofStefano della Chiaiewho was active in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and across Latin America as an organizer, militant, and allegedly terrorist. Serving multiple causes with Neofascist ambitions, influences, or supporters. Della Chiaie demonstrates the embryonic connections between Nationalist organizations as mediated by networks of individuals. This further complicates not only what or who constitutes a Fascist but also what or who constitutes a Latin American Fascist. Categories that seek to divide movements and tendencies into clearly demarcated Fascist – Anti-Fascist, Communist – Capitalist, etc. lack the specificity to assist in our search for the nebulous Latin American Fascism in order to establish exactly what is motivating the growth of a modern and youth-centric Fascist milieu in Mexico City as evidenced by the emergence of Fascist Rock.
Fascism in Latin America Today
In the public mind, Fascism ison the riseand represents a profoundthreatto the rules-based international order. However, Fascism is not demonstrably surging to seize state power in Europe, North America, or Latin America, despite the election of several Right-Wing candidates. The emergence of Mexican Fascist Rock as a genre with links to the thriving scenes in Italy and Spain does however highlight that cultural Fascism in Latin America may be growing into a new and more dynamic form. While there is no evidence of a viable political vehicle for Fascist ideas, ongoing regional conflicts may provide fertile soil for the development of new Fascist political projects. Previous Fascist movements in Latin America have been defined negatively, by conceptualizing success in preventing the victory of their ideological adversaries (Communists). Fascist Rock and the beginning of a development of regionally significant ideas or points of reference within the Fascist milieu may signify a transition to a more active and totalizing concept of victory.
Attendance of a few hundred at a  Fascist Rock concert does not demonstrate the birth and inexorable rise of Mexican or Latin American Fascism, but it does signify that contrary to some observers’ assertions, Fascism is not dead nor is it fossilized into archaic forms. Accepting that Fascism today resembles the Fascism of 1922 only in an abstract sense, it is possible to observe conditions today across Latin America that may provide fertile ground for the crystallization of new revolutionary politics. In general, The Empire Strikes Back, Tequila Sunrise, and other Fascist Rock shows signify not only is Fascism reestablishing previous trans-Atlantic connections with Italian and Spanish organizations but that there is a growing youth element within the “Fascist milieu”. Fascism in Latin America and across the modern world may resemble the totalitarianism of the 20th century only in weltanschauung, but this should not lead to it being discounted as a cheap imitation. Fascism for the Third Millennium demonstrates the staying power of the Third Way Ideology and concerts such as the Empire Strikes Back demonstrate that there remain successful efforts to appeal to the “springtime of beauty”.

A Changing Political Landscape: The Growth of the Far-Right in Europe,"European politics is becoming increasingly fragmented and polarised with far-right parties advancing throughout the continent. Italy has a far-right government; far-right parties in France and Spain are gaining traction, and traditional right-leaning conservatives are edging further right in the United Kingdom. This move away from centrist politics is a trend which has grown in recent years across Europe as different crises have developed.
There was a time when far-right parties in government were frowned upon by the European community. Austria, for instance, suffered severe backlash in the late nineties when the far-right Freedom Party entered into a coalition with Austria’s conservative People’s Party. Measures were imposed,diplomatic visits were cancelled, and the EU implemented sanctions. However, in the past decade, the far-right isbecoming normalized across democratic Europe.
Crisescan be attributed to changes in political ideologies. The global financial crisis of 2008, the migration crisis, the pandemic and subsequent lock-downs, and the war in Ukraine are all attributed to the steady rise of far-right populism throughout Europe. These recurrent crises highlight a consistent failure of current leaders to meet demands ofprotection; protection against war, economic crashes, andimmigration. This failure pushes individuals towards parties that offer different and extreme methods of protection. Such as expanding military power and cracking-down on so-called illegal migration. Here, far-right parties gain the opportunity to position themselves as champions of strength and safeguarding, offering new hard-line politics on immigration, economics, and nationalism.
Looking across Western Europe, many right-winged politicians in Italy, France, Spain, and the UK follow a similarrhetoric. Severe (ethno)-nationalism and a return to traditional values are often at the forefront of these far-right parties. Often this nationalism is combined withanti-immigrationand anti-minority politics. In this sense, these far-right parties weaponize culture, spreading mistrust of the mainstream and establishing a war on ‘woke’.
Italy
In 2022, Italy made waves by electing not only their first female Prime Minister but also their most right-winged party sinceWorld War Two. Fratelli d’Italia (FdI), headed by Giorgia Meloni focuses on curtailing immigration, promoting traditional Christian values and protecting Western civilisation through extreme nationalism. But despite becoming one of the most right-winged parties within Europe, the election of FdI to power in Italy was not necessarily a surprise. Populist right-winged parties had been steadily on the rise in Italy since the 1990s, gaining strength and support throughout the party system.
Meloni herself hails from a neo-fascist background, having joined the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement Party – a far-right neo-fascist group – at age 15.As Prime Minister, she has also tightened relationships with other far-right political groups within Europe. She supported and rallied the far-right Vox Party in Spain prior to the July 2023 election, while at home has cut benefits and enacted strict rules onsame-sex parents. As a whole, members of FdI have been accused of using the language of populist platforms, and spreading xenophobic, racist, anti-immigration, and nationalist speech. Regardless, Meloni has morphed into one of Europe’s mostpowerfulleaders.
France
In France, the far-right remains a key player in voting trends. Marine Le Pen’s party National Rally remains thesingle biggestopposition party to Macron’s Renaissance despite losing both the 2017 and 2022 elections. The influence of the far-right National Rally is only growing, with the party improving their performance in the 2022 election, winning41.46%of votes. The National Rally as a party, maintain a strong anti-immigration policy focusing on ensuring strong nationalism. This sentiment has only grown stronger in recent years, with the party pledging to focus on migration policies, the cost of living, and security amid growing public concern surrounding these issues.
The National Rally has not gone without controversy, however. With a majority in the French parliament feeling that the party had maderacist or xenophobiccomments in regard to migration issues. Regardless, based on the trajectory of their performance between the 2017 and 2022 elections, analysts believe thatLe Penhas a high chance of winning power in France in the 2027 elections. If this is the case, with France as one of the most influential powers in the EU, the political landscape of Europe could be drastically altered.
This change is already in motion as more far-right leaders are taking power and growing more popular in public opinion across Europe. This growing popularity kicks off a trend where more traditional centrist parties are shifting further right andallyingwith far-right fringes. This is particularly clear in Macron’s Renaissance Party, which has slowly adopted more far-right policies, particularly on migration and security issues, shifting away from their traditional centrist politics further right.
United Kingdom
Over the thirteen years that the Conservative Party have been in government, each new cabinet has adopted more extremeright-wingedpolicies. The current cabinet under Rishi Sunak has introduced new extreme policies on immigration, net zero, and the war on woke. Sunak, along with Home Secretary Suella Braverman, have attempted to fight the ‘war on woke’ by attacking multiculturalism and minority groups such as LBGTQ+ and migrants. Braverman’s ‘Hurricane of Migrants’ and Sunak’s ‘A Man is a Man and a Woman is a Woman’ speeches given at the party conference in Manchester display populist markers common infar-rightspheres.
The growing far-right within the Conservative Party is in part due to the events of Brexit and the successes of the United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP). Creating a ‘Britain for Britons’ rhetoric with anti-Europe and xenophobic nationalistic sloganeering, Brexit promoted the idea of taking back control from European powers, an idea which was a central policy of UKIP in 2015-2016. In 2015, UKIP was becoming more and more popular, having secured12% of the votein the General Election. With their anti-European and anti-immigration stance, UKIP was successfully stealing Conservative voters. As a result, the Conservatives began adopting more extreme right-winged views to combat losing votes.
As the Conservatives drift further right in their politics, however, they risk losing dedicated voters. An Opinium poll for theObserverfound that out of 900 people who voted Conservative in the 2019 election,34%said they would vote for other parties at the next general election. Whether these voters are seeking to vote for the new right-winged Reform UK Party or more left-leaning parties such as Labour or the Liberal Democrats remains to be seen. However, the loss of confidence in the Conservatives highlights a potential pushback against the normalisation of extreme far-right policies.
Spain
Prior to the July 2023 snap elections, the Spanish Vox Party – led by Santiago Abascal doubled its regional and local vote. As a traditionallyanti-immigration, anti-abortion, and ultra-nationalist far-right group, they became the third largest party in Spain. Striking up acoalitionwith Spain’s centre-right People’s Party (PP), Vox was quickly coming into the fold. Having won15.1% of the votesin 2019, Vox was becoming a serious threat to the future of LGBTQ+ and women’s rights.
By the July 2023 snap elections, however, their upward trend was losing steam. Their regional votes dropped to 12.4%, despite gains in local elections, and their representation plummeted from 52 to33 seatsin the lower house. Vox remains the third-largest party in Spain, however, its losses relegates it tonear-irrelevance. It remains to be seen whether Vox can regain strength in the coming months after the snap election.
Conclusion
The growth of the far-right continues to be an upwards trend in Europe, regardless of any losses in national elections. Outside of the aforementioned four countries, far-right politics is expanding and growing throughout Europe; with Finnish, German, and Austrian far-right parties gaining traction. With this expansion of ultra-nationalism, attacks on minority rights, and anti-immigration sentiments comes the risk of a descent into fascism. As it stand now, far-right politics has infiltrated Europe at a rapid speed. Ten or twenty years ago, the idea of a far-right party almost winning a national election was abhorrent, and now several European countries have far-right governments. It could be that these governments become increasingly fascist, particularly as more crises strike the continent. Or, will far-right politics prove too extreme for European citizens, and result in a continent-wide pushback?

The Forgotten Faces: Chin Refugees in India’s Quandary,"“The Chin People of Burma: Unsafe in Burma, Unprotected in India” is what aHuman Rights Watchreport dated January 2009 states so bluntly. What brought on this unapologetic disposition back in 2009, still continues and pervades the lives of the Chin people seeking asylum in India, even in 2023. From structural xenophobia to the Indian law failing the refugees- the everyday struggles of the Chins are unseen and pushed furthermore to the peripheries.
Post coup Myanmar is seeing extreme assault and violence committed by the Tatmadaw (Myanmarese Military) towards the ethnic Chin communities residing in the impoverished Chin State. Thesewar crimestoward the Chin people stem from continued efforts to persecute the Christian Chins, so as to replace Christianity with Buddhism and coerce the assimilation of all minority ethnic communities into mainstream Myanmarese culture. Leaving no stone unturned, these gross violation of human rights include forced labour, arbitrary arrests, gender based sexual violence, arson, targetting clergy and more.
Furthermore, Chin State is the poorest region in Myanmar, making its residents more vulnerable to military assaults and crimes.Over 80% of the Chin populationlive in poverty and have food insecurity, and given their ethnic marginalization and limited resources, they find themselves at the mercy of the Tatmadaw. These factors significantly influence the decision to seek asylum in neighboring countries, India included.
With core values and ancient principles such as‘Atithi Devo Bhava,’ which embodies the belief that a guest is akin to God, the Indian refugee law, or its lack thereof, opens a controversial and ongoing debate. Despite being home to around74,600 Myanmarese refugees and asylum seekers, India is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, nor its 1967 Protocol. While the most popular speculated reason for India not being a party to the UN Convention is the convention’s Eurocentric Approach, India has furthermore failed to formulate an independent Refugee Policy. Nonetheless, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) works in close tandem with the Central Government of India to offer protection and upliftment services to forcibly displaced people from non-neighbouring countries and Myanmar, and has been operating since 1981.
“Where there is no Law, there is no Freedom”
Underscoring the critical relationship between legal frameworks and how freedom is upheld by them, John Locke’s statement glares at the situation of the refugees in India. With the absence of a Refugee Law, the treatment of refugees is governed by India’s Registration of Foreigners Act of 1939, the Foreigners Act of 1946, and the Foreigners Order of 1948. None of these Acts differentiate between undocumented migrants and refugees. The most fundamental difference between migrants and refugees lies in the fact that refugees are forcibly displaced people, while migrants are not. Hence to subject these two, very distinct sections of people under the same legislations is deplorable.  In 2020, the Indian government made an announcement regarding the possibility for registered refugees to seeklong-term visasalong with work and/or study privileges. Nevertheless, the actual number of long-term visas granted to Chin refugees remains uncertain. Consequently, India lacks an established procedural mechanism to officially safeguard refugees residing within its territory. This deficiency can further be exploited to the benefit of notorious criminals and assailants, especially targeting Chin refugee women. Unfortunately, refugees in India are subject to ad hoc policies that vary significantly based on their nationality and geopolitical stances.
Considering how the Chin refugees share ethnic and kinship ties with the Kuki-Mizo-Zomis in Mizoram and Manipur states of India, this contention transcends not only boundaries, but ethnicities as well. And with the absence of a refugee framework, least ensured is a state of chaos. For instance, back in 2021 the Mizoram State Government of India issued aStandard Operating Procedureregarding facilitation of refugees from Myanmar. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs was quick to reiterate how the State Governments have no powers to grant refugee status to any foreigner. Rising ideological differences between the Mizoram State Government and Central Government on this matter has led totiffsand clashes, which could have possibly been avoided with an explicit refugee framework in place.
With virtually no legal aid and protection particularly articulated for Refugees, the living conditions of the Chin Refugees can be notably challenging. Employment prospects are primarily confined to the informal sector, frequently characterized by low wages, strenuous labor, and safety hazards. Working mostly in factories in West Delhi, the degree of exploitation they face increases furthermore due to language barriers, as hardly10% of these refugees can either speak English or Hindi. Due to their distinct physical, cultural, and linguistic characteristics in comparison to the local population in Delhi, their “otherness” undoubtedly exposes them to the potential risk of mistreatment and harassment by the local communities.
As a breathe a fresh air, in an endeavor to combat the sexual and gender based violence against refugee women and to provide them with a safe, free space- The UNHCR runs aWomen’s Protection Clinic(WPC) in a house down a winding lane in western New Delhi- especially for the refugee women of the Chin community from Myanmar. The WPC was established in 2005 and has been primarily funded by the Australian government for the majority of its existence. More than 1,250 women and girls from the ethnic Chin community in Myanmar have undergone counseling at the clinic, where a policy of absolute confidentiality is upheld. However, the clinic’s primary role is to emphasize areas where protection is lacking.
Since the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is assigned with the duty of looking into the Chin Refugee case, it also provides many refugees with their only form of identification- the UN Card. However, the possession of only a UN Card to seek medical facilities by the Chins, inculcates multiple levels of complexities and hardships, as many healthcare facilities might not accept them. Especially pertaining to the covid-19 Pandemic, India’s vaccination drive only consisted of aiding its own citizens who held one of the 11 mandatory official documents. Hence, refugees with only UN Cards werebarredfrom getting vaccinated. An estimated6 Chin refugeessuccumbed to Covid-19 without any medical care or vaccinations because they lacked documents and monetary resources required for hospitalization.  This indirect denial of vaccines to the Chin Refugees by the Government can be seen as a breach of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution- which safeguards the fundamental right to life and liberty.
While the Chins escape Myanmar due to compromised safety and persecution, the degree of betterment their lives achieve in India is questionable. The UNHCR in India carries out the process of Refugee Status Determination (RSD) for individuals seeking asylum from non neighboring countries and Myanmar, yet even the UNHCR is not permitted by the Indian Government to set up offices in border states, which might have aided in efficiency of the RSD process. It is a fact that India has been applauded globally for itstreatment of the Tibetan Refugees– by enabling Tibetan Refugees to be beneficiaries of Central Government schemes such as MGNREGA and PDS.  However this support is not the same, as can be seen in the case of Rohingya and Chin Refugees. Will India adopting a refugee policy raise concern of security due to its alreadyporous borders? With over a staggering36.4 Millionrefugees globally, it certainly becomes interesting how India’s politics of responding to the refugee crisis pans out not only within India, but also strongly depicts India’s commitment to humanitarian assistance and diplomatic relations with the home countries of these refugees.

“The Global North vs. The Global South” or “Democracy vs. Autocracy”? It’s Time to Put Away the Binary Rhetoric,"The term “Global South” is undergoing a transformation, shifting from its erstwhile abstract political connotation to a dynamic arena characterised by geopolitical rivalries and intense competitions for national influence. This evolving landscape has prompted certain states and coalitions of states to strategically embrace the concept as an integral component of their diplomatic calculus.
The notion of the “Global South” has taken centre stage in numerous high-level multilateral meetings in 2023, commanding considerable attention and deliberation. In early January, India hosted the esteemedVoice of the Global South Summit 2023, a testament to its commitment to fostering a shared platform for the discourse on the concerns, interests, and priorities that profoundly impact developing nations. The summit served as a pivotal forum for the exchange of ideas and the exploration of solutions, uniting these nations in voice and purpose as they addressed their shared concerns and priorities.
In February, the Munich Security Conference convened a dedicated session titled “Recalibrating the Compass: South-North Cooperation,” underscoring the imperative for Western nations to actively pursue engagement with the “Global South.” In May, during theG7 Summitheld in Hiroshima, Japan, earlier this year, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida championed the idea of “free and open international order based on the rule of law” and how it can benefit the “Global South.”
In the gathering ofthe 15th BRICS Leaders’ Summit, convened in the heart of South Africa, a momentous decision was reached on the 24th of August. The decision aimed at bolstering the collective voice of the “Global South”and the BRICS group extended an invitation to several nations. Among these invitees are Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Argentina, each standing as exemplars of strategic importance and shared values.The Western mediawidely believe that this seminal step underscores China’s and Russia’s ambition to reshape the international order and to foster a united front in safeguarding the interests and aspirations on the world stage.
In September, at the concluded G20 Summit in New Delhi, India strategically leveraged its role as the host nation to both curb China’s engagement with the United States and the European Union and foster enhanced ties with countries of the “Global South.” Indian Prime Minister Modi assumed a leadership role during the summit, steering discussions towards a series of pertinent issues concerning the “Global South” and ultimately achieving concrete outcomes aimed at bolstering support for these nations. Notably, one pivotal achievement was the formal inclusion ofthe African Unionas a G20 member, affording it a status akin to that of the European Union. India is also considered a competitor and leader in the “Global South.”
In the contemporary landscape, the growing significance of the geopolitical narrative concerning the “Global South” assumes a pivotal role on the international platform. A pressing inquiry emerges: what catalyst lies behind the abrupt escalation in focus directed towards the “Global South”? Principally, this phenomenon can be attributed to the persistingrivalrybetween the United States and the dynamic interplay involving China and Russia.
Over an extended period, the foreign policy strategists in Washington have maintained the perspective that China’s enduring foreign policy goals encompass a profound reshaping ofthe rules-based international order, ultimately aimed at displacing the United States from its global hegemonic position. Within this context, the “Global South” has emerged as a central focal point in China’s pursuit of this aspiration. Notably, during the 2023 General Assembly leaders’ meeting, China’s Vice President, Han Zheng, articulated a policy statement: “Being the largest developing nation, China naturally aligns itself with the Global South, sharing a common destiny and aspirations with fellow developing countries.”
Western nations, primarily spearheaded by the United States, have historically undervalued the strategic significance held by these nations. The present year’s resurgence in prioritising “Global South” countries can be construed as a concerted endeavour by Western statesmen in foreign policy to rectify their prior “disinterest” and to offset theburgeoning influenceof China and Russia. Within this framework, the European Union has unveiled theGlobal Gateway Initiativeas a counterpoint to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, with the United States displaying keen interest in forging a partnership with India to rival China’s sway in the “Global South.” Evidently, China is leveraging its status as a developing country to foster relationships with countries in the “Global South,” seeking to erode thecontainmentefforts exerted by the United States.
In the context of the Russian-Ukraine war, the perspectives of nations hailing from the Global South have emerged as a significant catalyst, prompting Western nations to recognise the pivotal role played by the “Global South.” Beyond the borders of the United States and Europe, these countries tend to interpret Russia’s involvement in Ukraine as a predominantly regional matter rather than a worldwide crisis. Their ethical values and strategic interests frequently diverge from those prevalent within the Euro-Atlantic sphere. Consequently,a number of themhave refrained from issuing public condemnations against Russia.
Within the milieu of nations situated in the “Global South,” the question arises as to whether they are inclined to align themselves with the narrative of “The Global North vs. The Global South,” as perceived by China and Russia, or if they lean towards the Western perspective of “Democracy vs. Autocracy.” The probable response, one may posit, lies in their discerning reluctance to unequivocally align with either side. As Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong said atthe Nikkei Future of Asia conference, “It’s natural for some countries to be closer to one side or the other, but most countries would prefer not to be forced to choose between the U.S. and China… A more stable, less tense configuration is for the two powers to have overlapping circles of friends.”
Despite the passage of over three decades since the culmination of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, it is evident that certain policymakers continue to find themselves ensnared within the confines of 20th-century paradigms that endorse a zero-sum approach. Against the backdrop of contemporary U.S.-China/Russia relations, the prevailing notion of the “Global South” finds its roots in the enduring commitment of these major powers to a Cold War mindset and a zero-sum approach when assessing and engaging with one another. The Cold War mentality, entrenched within abinary worldview, classifies international actors as neither allies nor adversaries, advocating for the management of major power dynamics through confrontational polarization. Guided by a zero-sum perspective, the United States, China, and Russia not only eschewopportunitiesfor mutually advantageous and collaborative initiatives spanning a spectrum of shared concerns, thus yielding benefits for all three nations and the broader global community, but also resort to arbitrary suppression of each other’s interests.
The great powers must eschew the deployment of binary rhetoric. Through an idealist lens, the abandonment of such rhetoric stands as the inaugural stride towards the fostering of global cooperation and the forestalling of any deterioration ofa new type of Cold War. Approaching the matter from a realist vantage point, it is crucial to recognise that the nomenclature denoting the “Global North” and “Global South” should not be misconstrued as emblematic of monolithic entities; rather, it encompasses a mosaic of nations, each vested with its own unique tapestry of cultural and national interests.
Alongside the overarching backdrop of great power rivalry, non-great power countries oftentimes prioritise immediate concerns, such as economic advancement and access to vital resources. These pragmatic objectives take precedence over considerations pertaining to ideological or strategic alignment. Consequently, their interactions with major powers transpire in a case-specific fashion, contingent upon the tangible benefits they stand to accrue from such engagements.
The utilisation of binary rhetoric unquestionably risks oversimplifying the intricate mosaic that constitutes the international landscape.","November 07, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-global-north-vs-the-global-south-or-democracy-vs-autocracy-its-time-to-put-away-the-binary-rhetoric/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,NewsRoom
Resurgence of the Israeli-Palestine conflict: implications and consequences in a regional balance more precarious than ever,"On October 7, the military groupHamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, launched anattack on Israel.
The offensive by the Palestinian militia, planned in the‘Al-Aqsa flood’ operation, took place on three simultaneous fronts: thousands of rockets were fired from Gaza, while militants invaded Jewish communities around the Strip and attempted landings by sea. About 200 people were supposedlytaken hostage; the latest sources report that two hostages of US nationality, a mother and daughter, have been freed.
In these first two weeks of the conflict, there have been numerous episodes of violence on both sides, which have attracted enormous media attention around the world. Brutal raids by Hamas, such as the one at themusic festivalthat claimed 260 lives, triggered a reaction from Israel, which began abombingon an alreadycompletely besieged Gazaand until recently prevented the entry ofhumanitarian aidfor the civilian population. After two weeks of increasingly intense clashes, with bloody attacks on both sides,4,200 Palestinians were killedand about 13,200 wounded. According to UN sources on statements by Israeli authorities, at least1,400 people in Israelhave been killed and around 5000 injured  since the Hamas attack on October 7.
As a response, the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has declaredstate of war. The attack by Palestinian militiamen had probably been prepared and premeditated for months, if not years.Many theorieshave been put forward on why the Israeli intelligence, that is believed to be the most prepared of all the Middle East, could have overlooked an offensive of such magnitude: could be a technology mismatch that prevented it in tracking their communications, or the help fromregional alliessuch Hezbollah, the Shia cell in Lebanon.
One thing is clear: it was a catastrophic intelligence failure on Israel’s part, which struck a severe blow to the State of Israel’s image of invincibility and is forcing it to re-establish regional deterrence with an iron fist.
This is exactly what Israel’s foreign policy is based on: an enormous military deterrence to impose itself on a precarious regional balance.
The regional sphere is crucial to the evolution of the conflict. The Israeli-Palestinian war has always been an ideological clash in the region, lining up two sharply opposing factions.
Afterthree warsthat had seen it take sides against coalitions of Arab states, Israel had begun to flank its military defence strategy with a diplomatic policy, normalising relations withEgypt in 1979and signing a peace treaty withJordan in 1994. The crowning achievement of Israel’s strategy of progressive de-escalation of relations with its neighborhood were theAbraham Accordsof 2020, which normalized diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and renewed ties with Morocco.
Missing from Israel’s regional diplomatic plot, however, was the crown jewel: Saudi Arabia.
Lately, it seemed that anormalization dealbetween the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Israel was closer than ever. The key of the relation lies in a geometry of different yet complementary interests. The Saudi Crown, represented by the ambitious heir Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is aiming towards anuclear programmeand thus wants both security assurances and a nuclear cooperation from the US, minus the rigorous non-proliferation constraints that often accompanies such agreements. Additionally, a great deal for the Crown would also comprehend security guarantees and access to technologies from USA, as Mohammed Bin Salmanaspiresto transform Saudi Arabia in a hyper-modern country, open to global financial circuits and energetically advanced while also remaining faithful to the vocation of religious leader in the region. If a deal was reached, Saudi Arabia would be keen on establishing diplomatic ties with Israel.
On the other hand, normalization with the Saudis would bring Israel to a whole new level of regional security: that would model anew strategic bipolar frontwith the common goal of containment of Iranian influence in the region.
Regarding the Iranian dossier, Riyadh has an ambiguous stance.Saudi Arabia and Iranare far from being allies, but they have recently restablished relations, bringing together two sides of a seemingly irremediable divide. Rather, it seems that Riyadh aims at playing at multiple tables, setting the relation with Washington onnon-exclusive groundswhile approaching Iran and China for strategic and economic purposes. The recent entry of bothSaudi Arabia and Iran in the BRICSbloc further underlines Riyadh’s intention to keep a courtly but safe distance from Washington.
So while the normalization with Riyadh would be a great diplomatic victory that could grant Israel a new privileged position in the region, there is still one pressing matter.
If not managed properly, the Palestinian issue could be a dealbreaker for this process. Lately there had also been meetings and talks between the Saudi Crown Prince and US President Biden.Last year, the two sides underscored their enduring commitment to a two-state solution, deemed essential to reach a comprehensive peace in the region; but this is a solution thatIsrael does not seem to accept.
Now, after the escalation of the conflict, Saudi Arabia has momentarilyput on holdthe possibility of an agreement with Israel. The new scenario could reshape the regional balance and bring new priorities to the table. The development of the conflict could make it inconvenient for the parties to continue the negotiations, calling for more neutral declarations in the meantime. While it doesn’t appear that Mohammed Bin Salman is planning a full reverse on the matter, it rather seems like the parts are awaiting more adequate and calmer times to discuss. Moreover, the crisis has been the event that pushed the president of Iran and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to hold theirfirst-ever talksafter their rapprochement in April. Both parties diplomatically declared that the priority was to engage with all international and regional parties to halt the ongoing escalation.
Keep your friend close, but your enemies closer: Riyadh does not want to let go of a proficuous approach with Israel, but Iran’s incumbent presence on Hamas’ attack is enough of a reason to keep the relation steady.
In fact, Teheran is the other great actor of the regional game, if not the trueéminence griseoperating behind the scenes.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, openlydenied Iran’s involvementin Hamas’ attack but just as explicitly expressed satisfaction for the strike inflicted on Israel. The foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is committed from the roots to the unsparing protection of the world’s poor and oppressed peoples; this translates inmilitary opposition via proxies to the ‘oppressors’, namely Israel, presented as an illegitimate political entity occupying Muslim lands. In this case, support for the Palestinian cause takes the form of extensive ideological, financial and military assistance to Hamas. Since the Khomeinist Revolution, Tehran is relentlessly expanding its ideological sphere of influence in the region, and the use of proxies such asHezbollah in LebanonandHamas in the Gaza Stripis a fundamental pillar of its strategy. In the increasingly frequent scenario of asymmetric warfare, proxies are extremely volatile entities but with great political, transnational and military effectiveness, acting as a Trojan horse to destabilize the region’s dominant enemy powers.Nevertheless, an escalation on a regional level could become a very serious matter and may not be the desired scenario for the involved powers. Israel’s Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu has warned Hezbollahthat opening a second war front with Israel would mean destructive consequences for the filo-Iranian Shia militia and for Lebanon. For Iran, openly deploying Hezbollah against Israel would mean bringing upon itself a full-scale regional war that could betoo dangerous to handle.
However, there is yet another aspect that should not be overlooked.
The Arab world responded cautiously to the crisis, with governments limiting themselves to mildly condemning the violence and calling for an end to military escalation. However, the Palestinian issue couldn’t be further marginalized and diminished only as asecondary variable in regional dynamics; on the contrary, it is strongly heartfelt by Arab populations and still appeals for pan-islamic solidarity. By looking vertically into the regional aspect of the conflict, the mismatch of intent between the political immobility of the Arab governments  and the popular feeling appears to be evident. After the resurgence of the conflict, the roads of many Arab cities have been filled by thousands of people manifesting in favor of the liberation of Palestine:all across the Middle East, protests eruptedin Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and the West Bank. In Egypt, protestants rallied in Cairo’s iconicTahrir Square, symbolic background of the 2011 Revolutions.
Therefore, the Arab States have to play on two levels. On one hand, political diplomacy prompts them – in most cases – not to take sides too openly against Israel, having realized that the new regional order cannot derogate from Tel Aviv; on the other hand, large and regionally spread protests in the Middle East have already proven to be an aspect to which government should pay particular attention in order to avoid repercussions or delegitimization.
At the international level, the risk of spillover of the conflict was addressed at theCairo summiton Saturday 21 October. Here, some of theworld leaders involvedin this crisis met. The purpose of the meeting was to look into ways to halt an escalation of the conflict into a wider regional war. But the absence of Prime Ministers from USA, UK, e the total absence of representatives from Saudi Arabia, Iran and -significantly- the two parties at war, highly impacted on the possibility of bringing tangible results out of the meeting and producing a joint statement to bring the parties to an agreement on a ceasefire.
But overall, the resurgence of this conflict has left the world wondering what is the role and responsibility of the international community.
While international organizations and global fora -theUN, theEU– have righteously condemned both the barbaric attacks from Hamas and the collective punishment of the Palestinian people operated by Israel, this tragic situation points out the undeniable incapacity of international community and world leaders to anticipate and properly deal with crises of this magnitude, which certainly did not develop in a fortnight. The situation in Gaza was not peaceful before October 7. International Organizations such asHuman Rights WatchandAmnesty Internationalhave been denouncing the criminal acts perpetrated by the State of Israel for years, and the international community was well aware of the dire situation from its very beginning. Yet, they remained silent, did not act on it, or choose to let more cynical interests unfold in the region. Aside from empty declarations of intents, made in international fora stalled by opposing world powers, what we are left to confront with today is a humanitarian tragedy and the failure of international diplomacy.
It seems therefore crucial to rethink the role of the international community as a whole.

(Analysis) DPRK-Russia-China Economic Triangle,"Russia, China, and DPRK Flags. Source:CGTN
Amid Sino-American power competition, there has been a recognizableshift towards bipolarity. Groupings along the fault lines of the Washington and Beijing consensus have been forming. Greateralignment between the Republic of Korea and Japan, thePhilippine’s exit from Belt and Road Initiative(BRI),Italy’s possible exit, and the EU’s de-risking approach vis-à-vis China show one side of the coin. On the other hand, recent developments in trilateral and bilateral relations involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and the Russian Federation signal a significant shift towards greater long-term trilateral economic alignment.
TheDPRK’s gradual easing of border restrictions, first imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in early 2020, has garnered notable attention in recent months. This gradual reopening began with the reception of Chinese and Russian delegations in Pyongyang last July during the commemoration of the70th anniversary of the Armistice Agreement. The implications of this easing of restrictions are especially pertinent for the DPRK’s immediate neighbors and allies, primarily the PRC and Russia.
Notably,Chinese state media reported that the DPRK would reopen its borders to foreign nationals for the first time since the pandemic on September 25th. According to CCTV, Pyongyang authorities would permit foreigners to enter the country following a two-day quarantine period upon arrival. While DPRK state media had not yet officially reported this development, it underscored a fundamental shift in the DPRK’s approach to safeguarding its national interests, with a continued focus on national security and self-sufficiency, albeit with a pragmatic outlook on how to engage its neighbors on its own terms, drawing on the lessons learned from the pandemic.
The initial decision to implement a strict “iron curtain” around North Korea was a rational choice to protect the nation’ssusceptible healthcare systemfrom being overwhelmed. Over time, the rationality behind these decisions warped intoirrational paranoia. However, the leadership in Pyongyang, after rationalizing and taking stock of the mistakes and gains of its policies, appears to have recognized the “advantages” of COVID-19 protection measures. In other words, the DPRK, more separated than ever from the rest of the world by both sanctions and pandemic emergency measures for almost 5 years, is attempting to return to a new stable equilibrium for self-sufficiency, drawing on the lessons from the pandemic to reengage its neighbors on its own terms. As a result, Pyongyang is positioning itself to pursue deeper economic cooperation with both Moscow and Beijing, with a preference for continued limited interaction with the wider international community. Examining the infrastructure developed along the borders with Russia and the PRC during the pandemic, it appears that the DPRK may repurpose much of it to support the advancement of a more sophisticated trade infrastructure with Beijing and Moscow.
The decision to label Russia as the DPRK’s “top priority” is intended to mitigate overdependence on the PRC and counter the U.S. strategy of maximum pressure. There has been a discernible shift in the narrative pre- and post-pandemic within the international community regarding the enforcement of sanctions. The reputational damage ofbypassing sanctionscurrently seems minimal on both the international and bilateral fronts for both Russia and the PRC. However, there is a distinction to be made between Russia’s and the PRC’s positions. While fundamentally behaving in a similar manner, namely vetoing sanctions at the UN and pursuing backdoor deals to bypass sanctions, Beijing does so in a much less overt manner as opposed to Moscow. While Russia has an already tarnished reputation due to the War in Ukraine, the PRC still wants to maintain a semblance of legitimacy and retain its renown as a supporter of multilateral institutions.
The DPRK has devised over the yearsmultiple methods—hard-currency generation, restricted and dual-use technology acquisition, covert transport, and covert finance—to circumvent the wide array of both bilateral and multilateral sanctions it is under and has depended on a very meager list of partners to do so, most notably the PRC and Russia. Particularly given the already strained states of both Sino-American and Russo-American relations, any engagement with the DPRK is unlikely to meaningfully exacerbate the situation further. Additionally, both Russia and the PRC have, throughout the pandemic, made a point of stressing theabsence of nuclear testsand the compounding impacts on the DPRK’s economy and populace from both the lockdowns and sanctions regime. Given the above, the UNSC sanctions imposed on the DPRK since 2006, peaking in pressure in 2017, have been rendered thoroughly ineffective.
All of this comes amid a shift in international attention, with the global focus shifting to crises such as Cross-Strait tensions, the Ukraine War, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. The PRC and Russian re-engagement with the DPRK will thus provide the latter with a larger platform on the international stage, thereby undermining the already crumbling effectiveness of maximum pressure and internationally enforced isolation strategies. This underscores the accuracy of earlier assessments that maximum pressure was aflawed approach.
However, despite the possibility of renewed international focus, the DPRK has realized that the International Community’s strategic attention span is likely to diminish further, regardless of any leverage it gains through these interactions. Consequently, forging closer ties with traditional partners like Russia and the PRC is a long-term strategy aimed at weathering periods of reduced interest from the U.S. and the international community. Therefore, this approach will help the DPRK avoid having to engage with the ROK, irrespective of the administration in power in Seoul, while maintaining North Korea’s focus on military development and amassing more leverage given Washington’s and Seoul’s passive policy approaches.
Deeper economic cooperation with China and Russia will thus prove to be highly advantageous for the DPRK. Despite the unprecedented economic challenges, increased economic interactions will further enhance the DPRK’s self-sufficiency, reducing its reliance on the rest of the international community and allowing Pyongyang to choose the actors it will engage. In such a scenario, the DPRK’s pursuit of self-sufficiency will be partially dependent on the PRC and Russia, as it has always been. While joint economic endeavors would deepen economic interdependency, the DPRK maintains a degree of freedom of choice vis-à-vis the partners it will engage. Additionally, in the current global geopolitical environment, worsening ties between the major world powers put the DPRK in a somewhat privileged position, wherein it is a necessary pawn in this hegemonic competition while maintaining a degree of independence and unassailability due to its nuclear arsenal.
During aconfidential briefingto lawmakers, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service revealed a concerning trend of annualeconomic contractionin the DPRK throughout the years 2020–2022. In response to these difficulties, it appears that the DPRK is taking measures to gradually repair and reinvigorate its beleaguered economy. A significant part of this restorative strategy seems to involve capitalizing on the lessons learned from the pandemic, building upon the earlier revision of trade laws, and implementing measures to assert control while simultaneously expanding trade activities with the PRC and Russia.
As briefly noted in the first few lines of this analysis, this alignment is symptomatic of a return to great power politics and bipolarity. Recognized as a “pacing threat” and identified as asecond polein the international system, China has adapted to this emerging global structure. While Chinese revisionism in the military sphere would be conducted through conflict over Taiwan, the majority of the competition with the United States would unfold in the economic arena. On the other hand, Russia, while not a peer of the U.S., can still be understood as a power with both revisionist aspirations and capabilities, as shown by the protracted conflict in Ukraine and Moscow’s resilience vis-à-vis international sanctions. By strengthening their respective relations with the DPRK and deepening trilateral cooperation, Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang are constructing a long-lasting sphere of influence, injecting a fragmenting impulse into the existing international system.
In recent years, relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have witnessed a remarkable upturn. Both have made commitments to enhance their coordination while sharing their collective dissatisfaction with the U.S., its allies, and the policy of maximum pressure. Overall, trade still lags behind the levels observed before the border closure byroughly 30%, based on figures from Beijing’s General Administration of Customs. However, the PRC’s trade volume with the DPRK has recently seen an uptick, reaching$216.53 million in September and totaling $1.63 billion for the first three quarters of 2023.
The DPRK’s relations with Russia are currently experiencing their most significant upswing since the Cold War era. Notably, on September 13,Kim Jong Un held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which discussions likely revolved around the expansion of North Korean weapons exports to Russia. It has been reported that theDPRK has already delivered a significant number of containers, believed to contain weapons and ammunition, to support Russia during the Ukraine war. TheRUSI reportsthat the DPRK has supplied Russia with ammunition at least five times since August 2023.South Korean authoritieshave also confirmed the dispatch of at least three hundred thousand rounds of artillery ammunition to Russia since August 2023.
Economically, an expanded arms trade relationship with Russia would be a significant boon for the DPRK, beyond merely offloading existing inventory to Russia. Increased arms sales to Russia are a potential and initial catalyst for economic growth through heightened consumption and access to foreign currency to exchange for goods. However, the isolated position of the military industry within the broader economic structure may limit the scope of these gains, rendering this a short-term remedy. In the long term, theeconomic benefits for the DPRK are likely to remain constrained. Once Russia’s involvement in Ukraine subsides or ceases, the demand for North Korean weapons is expected to decline rapidly, mirroring the swift rise. On the other hand, the collaborative trade initiatives undertaken at this juncture aim to instigate broader economic cooperation and provide an initial infusion of funds into the DPRK’s border infrastructure and overland trade networks, particularly those directed towards mining and trade facilitation.
As acknowledged by Kim Jong Un himself, the pandemic pushed the DPRK into very difficult straits. To weather these damages and the International Community’s disinterest, the DPRK has inched closer to the PRC and Russia. Against this backdrop, the DPRK’s current policies seem to be directed at the creation of ventures similar to past inter-Korean attempts at cross-border cooperation.
The DPRK might build upon the lessons learned from the Kaesong Industrial Complex and the Keumgangsan Diamond Mountain Project to establish joint cross-border economic “parks” for tourism and other trade-focused ventures. Thefences, guard posts, patrol roads, and other infrastructurebuilt or upgraded along the border with Russia and the PRC can be repurposed toward these objectives to serve increased cross-border trade activity.
The infrastructure built during COVID-19 for stocking and quarantine purposes is thus a primary indicator for gauging and understanding the scope of trilateral or bilateral cooperation. For instance, theUiju Quarantine Facility, formerly Uiju Airfield, is a complex subdivided into five distinct zones, each of which likely serves as a designated area for loading and unloading cargo. The Uiju compound is already integrated into the road and rail system of northwestern DPRK and China, from Dandong to Sinuiju to Pyongyang and other areas.
The DPRK’s mining sector is another major avenue for future cooperation. The DPRK has sizable deposits of minerals—reportedly circa 200 types—that are distributed all over its territory. UnderUN-imposed sanctions as of 2016, the DPRK is forbidden from selling gold, titanium, vanadium, and rare earth. However, with sanctions enforcement steadily failing, this obstacle might be fading, and the DPRK might be willing to explore all available avenues of economic cooperation.
Worth noting is the discussion that took place on October 19, 2023, betweenRussia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and his DPRK counterpart, Choe Son Hui, in Pyongyang. The two discussed prospects of bilateral collaboration and, most notably, agreed to re-convene in November as part of an intergovernmental commission to discuss “geological exploration and plans to supply energy and other goods.” As far as China is concerned, North Korean exports of minerals, such as tungsten, molybdenum, and compounds of metal and carbon, have seen aremarkable increase since 2022. Already in 2019, there werereports of Chinese interest in investing in North Korea’s mining sector. Specifically, the DPRK would have granted the PRC access to one of its rare earth mines in exchange for investment in solar energy.
Special attention should be paid to the northeastern provinces of the DPRK bordering both Russia and the PRC, primarily Hamnam (South Hamgyong Province). This region is mineral-rich but extremely vulnerable to extreme weather events, with limited and underdeveloped infrastructure for both transport and energy provision. However, the pandemic-induced reorientation of state resources towards domestic projects reversed this trend partially. Thus, given the region’s untapped potential, the mining sector holds a prime position in realizing the DPRK’s objective of post-COVID reconstruction and long-term economic growth. While it remains dangerous to invest in the DPRK, both Chinese and Russian companies have been doing so for decades before the pandemic. The mine complexes in this region—Sangnong, Geomdeok, Musan, Deaheung, and Jeongchon—hold reserves of zinc, lead, magnesite, iron ore, graphite, and rare earth elements (REEs) and offer a substantial source of state revenue for the DPRK.
These minerals play diverse and crucial roles across various sectors in both China and Russia. Zinc, widely used for galvanizing and creating alloys, serves as a cornerstone in the industrial sector, while its oxide finds applications in batteries, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and electrical equipment. Lead, with its applications in construction, cable sheathing, and lead-acid batteries, is a versatile resource essential in industrial and commercial contexts. Military applications of zinc and lead include their use in ammunition and radiation protection. Magnesite, primarily a refractory material, serves the industrial sector well, finding applications in high-temperature settings such as furnace linings and kilns. Additionally, it is utilized in the production of fertilizers and magnesium compounds. Iron ore, an industrial workhorse, is the key ingredient for steel production and is used in construction, infrastructure development, and the manufacturing of machinery. Iron and steel, derived from this resource, are integral to a wide array of consumer goods. Graphite, essential for refractory materials and lubricants, plays a pivotal role in industrial applications. Its military significance extends to aircraft and missile components, highlighting its role in military technologies. Rare earth elements (REEs) are indispensable for the electronics industry, finding application in smartphones, computers, and high-tech devices. Their significance is also prominent in military applications, including missile guidance systems, advanced radar technologies, and the aerospace industry, making REEs a valuable resource across the spectrum.
Therefore, focusing on the existing mining complexes spread throughout this region and building onto the investment and infrastructure established during COVID-19, the DPRK could expand rail and road connections to additional ports and distribution hubs, among others, Nampo Port or the Rason Special Economic Zone. This network, aimed at facilitating cross-border trade, both land and sea-based, would connect known cross-border hubs such as the cities of Hoeryung, Khasan, and Tumen to the aforementioned ports in the DPRK and to both Russia and the PRC, integrating with the Trans-Siberian Railway (Rason) and the port of Vladivostok, to name a few.
DPRK cross-border collaboration with both the PRC and Russia is set to increase over time for both trade and assistance in addressing pressing issues, including food shortages. COVID-19 has given the DPRK the time to establish stronger border controls and better facilities for goods stocking and processing. While tourism, traditional trade avenues, and even arms sales between the three countries are poised to return and continue in order to bring respite to the beleaguered DPRK economy, the mining sector should be a focus of analysis going forward.
South Hamgyong Province holds enormous resources and earning potential for the DPRK. However, it is important to note that nearly all the mines in the region, due to geological configurations, underdevelopment, and mismanagement of resources and infrastructure, face multiple issues. Going forward, the DPRK will need to increase investment in engineering, infrastructure, equipment, and, additionally, energy provision, given the poor state of the country’s grids.
The achievement of these infrastructural changes will require time and copious amounts of investment. Mining is undertaken on long-time horizons; while it might be viable for potential investors to sink capital in these projects now, they might be forced at a later time to let them go due to international pressure or sanctions. However, the current direction of global affairs seems to point to a gradual and unstoppable division along the Washington and Beijing consensi. This entails a further degradation in relations between the two forming blocs of alliances and like-minded partners undermining the sanctions regime and making actions that go against the American-led order a more frequent occurrence.
Currently, time seems to be on the DPRK’s side. On the one hand, the asymmetrical commercial relationship between the DPRK and Russia, wherein the former retains the majority of leverage, given Russia’s damaged reputation and the isolation resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Pyongyang is currently the only supplier that could offer a steady supply of compatible ammunition. On the other hand, the PRC’s support, which will be sustained in the long term given Beijing’s need for an anti-American system of alliances, puts the DPRK in a fairly advantageous position. Investment in infrastructure, therefore, could be achieved through cooperative policies with Russia and the PRC, offering a viable path for addressing the DPRK’s energy needs and further developing its mining sector.
Such a scenario would further entrench the DPRK in its isolationist and autarkic policies. Pyongyang will continue to increase its leverage vis-à-vis Washington and Seoul, not needing to engage in de-escalatory negotiations. The DPRK economy will likely witness short- and medium-term monetary injections thanks to its arms deals with Russia. Additionally, both Moscow and Beijing will continue to support the DPRK within the UN system, vetoing further sanctions and providing aid under the aegis of humanitarian assistance and post-pandemic reconstruction. Therefore, the DPRK will become progressively less inclined to engage with the international community and will gain more leverage when in discussion with International Organizations and NGOs, possibly deeming their involvement in the country as unnecessary.

Colombia’s Revolutionary Anti-Drug Plan: Breakthroughs an Challenges Ahead,"The Colombian government, led by President Gustavo Petro, has recently announced a bold new national drug policy that represents a radical shift in the country’s strategy to address drug trafficking and cultivation. The new plan outlined in the official document, titled “By growing life, we banish drug trafficking,” will be developed over 10 years and, as stated in the document, aims to significantly reduce cocaine production in Colombian territory by 43% by 2026. This would be achieved through agricultural projects promoting the voluntary substitution of coca cultivation with legal alternatives and by targeting the sophisticated drug trafficking networks in Colombia, focusing on production infrastructure, the marketing of production factors, and combating the illegal finances of traffickers.
The importance of effective action by Colombian institutions against drug trafficking and cultivation in the country is more urgent than ever. According to thelatest datareleased by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Colombia continues to have by far the largest number of hectares cultivated with coca, totaling 230,000 in 2022, which represents a dangerous 13% increase compared to the previous year.
Since his election in the summer of 2022, Gustavo Petro has strongly criticized thefailure and irrationalityof the so-called “war on drugs,” going so far as to consider it the root cause of criminal violence and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. However, despite the ambition of this new anti-drug policy, it remains to be seen how it will be implemented and whether it will succeed in reversing the seemingly unstoppable increase in coca cultivation.
Exploring the Nuances of the Strategy’s Two Pillars: ‘Oxygen’ and ‘Asphyxiation’
The strategy is structured around two pillars, “oxygen” and “asphyxiation”.  The primary goal of the first pillar is to put an end to, or at least reduce, the dependency of small coca farmers on the drug economy. As highlighted in the document, simply replacing coca cultivation with legal alternatives is insufficient and has not worked in the past. The idea now is to adopt a multidimensional, long-term approach that ranges from providing economic support to businesses, offering state-purchased land for agrarian reform, to paying for environmental services, so that, for example, members of rural communities “engage in forest conservation”.
The second pillar, “asphyxiation,” aims to decisively target drug trafficking structures and identify the gains derived from the illegal drug market. Unlike previous policies, the current Colombian government seems to be focusing not only on forced eradication but also on its more strategic use, as well as enhancing technical, administrative, and financial means to combat the drug trafficking chain and money laundering. The text makes it clear that there is a commitment to intensify the dismantling of facilities involved in the production of illegal narcotics, with particular attention to those involved in the production of base and hydrochloride cocaine, heroin, and synthetic drugs. Among the new initiatives also the strengthening of the registration, inspection, and control system for metallurgical businesses that supply equipment for the production of illicit substances. Finally, there is a promise to enhance maritime, river, air, and land interdiction through investments in advanced surveillance technologies and increased patrolling and monitoring of critical areas, especially in border zones.
Why the ‘Total Peace’ Plan Matters for the New Anti-Drug Policy
The outcome of this new strategy appears to be closely intertwined with the government’s efforts to implement the so-called “Total Peace” plan. The latter, approved by the Colombian Congress in October 2022, sets the ambitious goal of ending violence in the country by signing peace agreements with as many of the 26 active armed groups in Colombia as possible. This includes some of the oldest and largest guerrilla groups in the country, such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) anddissident groupsfrom the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
Indeed, the official document of the new anti-drug policy recognizes the presence and influence of armed groups and criminal organizations in certain areas of the country as a hindrance to the strategy’s implementation. Specifically, reference is made to the regions of Norte de Santander, Putumayo, Cauca, and Nariño as “hot” areas with concentrations of coca cultivation and the presence of armed groups involved in drug trafficking. These regions are still scenes of violent armed conflicts for territorial expansion. As highlighted in thelatest reportfrom the Fundación Ideas Para la Paz, in the first year of Gustavo Petro’s government, there has been a reactivation of territorial disputes in some areas of Cauca and Putumayo.
At the same time, as mentioned, the “oxygen” pillar aims to ensure that rural communities dependent on illicit economies can make a progressive and sustainable transition to legitimate economies through a process of productive conversion facilitated by close collaboration with social leaders and other community actors. In this regard, ensuring the safety of social leaders and communities that choose to abandon coca cultivation is essential for achieving this goal. However, the134 homicides of social leadersrecorded between January and August 2023 serve as a warning for Colombian authorities and for the plans to combat criminal economies in President Gustavo Petro’s administration.
Concluding Remarks: A Lengthy Journey Ahead
Despite the progress and efforts made in establishing a dialogue with armed and criminal groups, Gustavo Petro’s peace ambitions are currently clashing with a verydifferent realityin which no clear improvements can be seen in the overall internal security of the country, neither in urban nor rural areas. However, as highlighted earlier, this is an essential condition for the implementation and success of the new drug policy. The success of this policy depends on ensuring improved security conditions, especially in the “hot” and strategically significant areas of the country where violence against civilians persists, fueled by clashes between armed groups for control of criminal economies.
Simultaneously, alongside peace talks, there is a need for greater investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education. The Colombian state must be able to demonstrate its strong presence and, therefore, gain more legitimacy in the most vulnerable areas of the country through these investments. This likely requires an economic effort much greater than the one declared by the Colombian government,estimated at around 21 billion pesos(approximately 5 billion dollars) for crop substitution projects alone.
Greater investments will also be needed to provide the necessary technologies to combat drug trafficking, strengthen the capabilities of the armed forces to intercept shipments, and destroy infrastructure dedicated to the production of illicit drugs. However, this goal is challenging to achieve with the current budget constraints in the defense sector, which saw abudget cut of over 800 million dollarsfor 2023.
Lastly, strong political leadership legitimacy would enable Petro to enact comprehensive reforms to ensure the continuity of these ambitious policies in future governments. This is a crucial aspect in the long term because the discontinuity between more liberal and conservative policies is undoubtedly the greatest threat to the efforts made during the four years of governance.
In addition to greater political legitimacy, how can President Petro ensure that his anti-drug policy continues to be implemented effectively and in the long term, avoiding the discontinuities of previous policies, given the political and institutional challenges?
Do you think the European Union (EU) should develop more extensive cooperation projects to support the Colombian government’s peace efforts, particularly in ensuring the safety and well-being of communities affected by the conflict?
How can international organizations play a role in promoting peace and stability in Colombia, given the complex dynamics involving multiple armed groups and ongoing violence?

Election Embers: Milei’s Unconventional Ascent in the Race for Argentina’s Presidency,"On the 19thofNovember 2023, Argentina will head to the polls to definitively choose the successor to Mr. Alberto Fernandez as the President of the country. The country has found itself in turbulent times,with inflation at well over 100% and poverty hovering around the 40% mark. Whoever wins the race to the Casa Rosada faces a significant challenge ahead, with a dissatisfied population growing impatient with politicians who seem incapable of delivering on their promises. Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Mr. Fernandez declared that he would not be seeking reelection, meaning that when the votes are all tallied, Argentina will definitely have a new President.
As expected, the 22nd October Elections narrowed down the race to two candidates:Sergio Massa won around 36% of the vote while Javier Milei garnered around 30% of the vote. The current Minister of Economy, Sergio Massa, was always seen as a strong contender. While he received acclaim for averting a complete economic collapse, he has also faced criticism due to the country’s decreasing foreign reserves.
Indeed, with the discourse on economic issues being at the forefront of the elections, Mr. Massa will certainly feel that he isbest equippedto be at the helm of the Argentine Republic.
However, a vehement dissenter from the previous statement would be Javier Milei, the candidate forLa Libertad Avanza.He’s often drawn comparisons to leaders like Brazil’s Former President Jair Bolsonaro and U.S. Former President Donald Trump, comparisons that he has willingly embraced.
WHO IS JAVIER MILEI?
Mr. Milei has quite an interesting profile, having  studied economics and working in the finance sector up until his election to Argentina’s Congress in 2021. Sporting sideburns and a haircut that would not be out of place in the pin-up poster of a glossy 80s magazine, Mr. Milei playing in Rolling Stone’s cover band in his youth seems rather poetically fitting. In going against the grain and separating himself from Argentina’s traditional political elite, Mr. Milei has found widespread support throughout the country that may very well propel him to victory in October.
Similar to Trump and Bolsonaro,Mr Milei has been described as far-right and ultraconservative, while he has shown an affinity for the term anarcho-capitalism.One would expect that these views would be seen as political anathema in a country where Peronism was dominant for the better part of the 20th Century, yet Milei’svictoryin the August primaries means Argentine voters do not seem to share that thought.
Milei has grabbed headlines for his explosive opinions which perfectly reflects his lack of interest in playing a balancing act in order to appeal to more voters. In this sense, Milei haspromisedto effectively blow up Argentina’s central bank and fully dollarize the economy. This will raise a lot of eyebrows in the international scene considering that Argentina recently acquired BRICS membership, an international cooperation organization that has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the dependency of international trade on the U.S. Dollar.
Furthermore, Milei has also expressedsupport for opinions traditionally aligned with right-wing rhetoricsuch as unrestricted gun ownership and the criminalization of abortion. The candidate has also endorsed the individual right to freely sell organs, in addition to rampant privatization of state companies, pension cuts, and charging for public hospital services. Taking into account the views that Milei has publicly espoused, it is hard to imagine a more ominous outcome for the left in Argentina than a Milei victory.
STRIKING THE IRON WHILE IT’S HOT
Argentina is currently marred in economic crises and there seems to be little cause for optimism. In September 2023,inflation soared to a staggering 124%, reaching its highest point since 1991, resulting in a substantial increase in the cost of living. These exact kinds of economic downturns have been the catalysts of the proliferation of ultra-right-wing ideals that may very well translate at the ballot box. Therefore, Milei draws strong support from the youth population, predominantly men, but his appeal spans various social strata and encompasses lower-income groups as well. This is a voting base that blames the previous regimes for Argentina’s economic ills and sees Milei’s radical outlook as the only logical remedy.
A similar case was observed in the 2018 Elections in Brazil. Jair Bolsonaro rode a wave of anti-PT(Workers Party) sentiment all the way to a decisive victory. Bolsonaro had no problem disparaging the regimes of Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff(who suffered impeachment in 2016), highlighting the corruption scandals that hit the country under their rule. Allegations of rampant misogyny and criticism of his record as Federal Deputy were not enough to derail Bolsonaro’s presidential bid, as he capitalized on the frustration of Brazilians with the former ruling party.
Milei may very well take a page from Bolsonaro’s book,pointing the fingerat Peronism and Kirchnerism, while proffering himself as the only viable solution. It is a strategy that worked wonders in the neighbouring country after all.
Although a first-round victory always seemed to be an unlikely outcome for both candidates, Milei will fancy his chances against Massa in the second round. While Massa’s victory in the first round was unexpectedly crushing, Milei enjoyed a similar performance in the primaries, and as such, will continue his presidential bid undeterred. His firebrand persona, coupled with his provocative remarks, lend themselves well to the current age of social media campaigning during elections, as Milei is more likely to trend online than his opponents, explaining his popularity among young people.
MILEI: A HOPE FOR THE RIGHT IN SOUTH AMERICA?
The left recently wrestled back control of South America, with the victories of the likes of Lula da Silva in Brazil and Gustavo Petro in Colombia, yet victory for Milei would be undoubtedly significant for the right in South America, considering Argentina’s pull in the region. While Massa and the Peronistsexceeded even their own expectationsin the October polls, Milei is still very much in the running.
Javier Milei has successfully positioned himself as an anti-establishment, with his signature line, “Long live liberty dammit!” serving as a rallying call for his supporters. And he will rely on it more than ever as Argentinians head to the ballot in November to choose the next president.
I invite our readers to reflect on the following questions:

A Culture War Won’t Save the Conservatives,"What, if anything, can save the UK’s ruling Conservative Party from certain defeatahead of the next general election? After a series of electoral losses in key constituencies and continuously poor performances in opinion polls, commentators suggest that imminent defeat is all but certain. Observers and politicians from both sides further add that after 13 years in power, the Conservatives are starting to look like an opposition party in waiting. But a struggle for survival can lead to acts of desperation, as exemplified by the Conservatives’adoption of a US-styleso-called ‘culture war’.
On October 19th, The Conservatives, colloquially known as the Tories,lost two local by-electionsboth held on the same day following the resignations of the Conservative Members of Parliament. This comes following the previous loss of two out of three by-elections in July. The constituencies of Tamworth, previously held by Nadine Dorries, and Mid Bedfordshire, which faced a by-election following the resignation of disgraced Chris Pincher, were held with significant majorities by the Tories following the 2019 General Election which saw an important overall majority for the Tories.
In 2019, many constituencies across the country that were previously strongholds of the main opposition, the Labour Party,voted Conservative for the first time. But constituencies returning to Labour or voting against the Conservative Party for the first time in decades, whichleader Sir Keir Starmer describedas “history in the making”, may reflect grander consequences to come for the Tories. The loss of the two constituencies places the ruling party in a difficult position in the context of a general electionexpected to take place next year, although Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader, Rishi Sunak, can call an election anytime between now and January 2025.
Alongside the electoral losses,Labour are ahead of the Conservatives in opinion polls by 20%. What’s more,the Tories also lost the constituenciesof Selby in the north of England and Somerset and Fromerton in the south following by-elections held in July this year, where the party previously held significant majorities following the 2019 general elections. However, the Conservative Party managed to hold on to the Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency made vacant afterBoris Johnson stepped downafter an investigation into the Partygate scandalconcluded he had deliberately misled and lied to the House of Commons.
With pollsters expecting defeats for the ruling party across all three by-elections in July, the Tories received a slim majority in the West London seat after voterstook a protest vote against the expansion of London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone(ULEZ) announced by the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. From the electoral win in Uxbridge, the Sunak administration saw a potential strategic opportunity by focusing on drivers. Sunak then went on to announce a number of moves with car-centric justifications, including plans to delay bans on petrol cars and the scrapping of the northern leg of HS2,the controversial high-speed rail projectwith anew price tag of £57 billion in 2019 prices.
Accompanying the proposals was an announcement that the government intended to roll back on its Net Zero goals,a move that commentators suggest is an attempt to create divisions amongst the electorateby driving a “green wedge” between voters and utilising a ‘culture war’, the schismatic social concept generally associated with the US, to split the support for Labour ahead of the next general election.
Through this approach,the Conservative’s are using social issues, such as trans and gender rights, in an attempt to divide the electorate. In fact, six cabinet members are focusing on such topics in their speeches during this year’s Conservative annual conference. However, some Conservative members spoke out against the culture war approach. Andrew Boff, a Conservative London Assembly member, was ejected from the speech of the then Home Secretary Suella Braverman after shouting “there’s no such thing as gender ideology” after Braverman denounced “gender ideology” as “woke”.
Before being removed as Home Secretaryfor the second time, Conservative MP Suella Braverman was accused of stoking culture war flames in a bid to place herself in a position for leader of the party should the Tories lose the next general election. The Home Secretary had previously caused outrage by claiming that she intended to put into place a law which would prevent charities from selling tents to homeless people.Braverman then took to X, the platform formally known as Twitter, claiming that “people, many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice” and occupying rows of tents.
On the remembrance weekend, London saw a pro-Palestinian march of 800,000 attendants, an event which Braverman repeatedly described as a “hate march”, to which critics and commentators accused Braverman of using populist tactics in pandering to the far-right. In an opinion article published in The Times, Bravermandescribed attendants at the marchas “hate marchers”, “Islamists” and “mobs”.
In the same piece,Braverman criticised the London Metropolitan Police Serviceby claiming that the force had a bias toward left-wing groups, such as the pro-Palestinian marches, versus demonstrations typically associated with the right, the anti-lockdown protestors for example. Braverman’s rhetoric led to Sunak removing her as Home Secretary whilst bringing back former Prime Minister David Cameron as the new Foreign Secretary.
What’s more, Braverman’s popularity in the Conservative Party is concentrated amongst a group known asthe New Conservatives, a populist collection on the right of the party brought in between Brexit and the 2019 election of Boris Johnson. Along with Braverman, the group represents the section of the party most in favour of utilising culture wars.
Whilst culture wars may be a feature of social and political discourse in the US,a recent IPSOS poll shows that such issues are not a priority for the electorate in the UK. According to the poll, voters believe that the Conservative Party is using the notion of a culture war for political purposes. Indeed, more than six in ten respondents agree that the party invents or exaggerates divisions in social attitudes and thatsuch exploitation poses a serious problem. Instead, voters put the National Health Service (NHS) and the economy as the top priorities but feel that the Tories are using culture wars to distract voters from such concerns.
The Tories are further displaying their culture war position ahead of the next general election through networking and events. The Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC), a right-wing international network focused on social and cultural issues,hosted a gathering in Londonwith prominent Conservative MPs in attendance.
The event saw a mixture of Conservative Cabinet ministers, such as Michael Gove and Kemi Badenoch, members of Australia’s Liberal Party and figures from the right of the US Republican party, such as the newly elected House Speaker, Mike Johnson,who defends the electoral fraud claims of former President Donald Trump. Withsome commentators calling it the “anti-woke Davos”, the ARC’s London meeting predominantly discussed socially conservative talking points, such as family values, a critique of ESG-led capitalism and the role of religion. Johnson stated that people ought to improve the world by using “the best of” classical liberalism and the Judeo-Christian tradition.
Meanwhile, such a cultural approach is finding its way into government legislation. On the 7th of November,King Charles III delivered his first speech outlining the Conservative Party mandatebetween now and the next general election. The speech included a total of 21 bills, 15 new and 6 continuations from the previous parliamentary session. Some of the new bills, including a push on oil and gas extraction in the North Sea and a Renters Reform Bill, demonstrate the divisive electoral tactics of the party. Of particular notice was the fact that the Conservatives failed to include a promised ban on LGBTQ+ conversion therapy, a proposal with noticeable opposition from those on the right in the party.
But the extent to which the Tories can push through 21 bills between now and the general election, remains a challenge, especially considering the disillusionment amongst the electorate. With the majority of the voters rejecting the idea of a culture war and instead prioritising matters such as the economy and healthcare, perhaps the Conservatives should attempt damage control before causing a potential electoral wipeout.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Spaniards Take To The Streets,"After anelectionlast summer that did not immediately result in a clear path to a coalition government, current Prime Minister Sanchez faces the wrath of Spaniards angry at him for potentially selling out the nation in order to stay in power. In order to serveanother termin power, Sanchez has promised amnesty to Catalonian political leaders who held an illegal vote for independence. This is a serious matter considering besides the vote, those who participated in violence and assisted the region with its temporary independence claim will be pardoned as well. Hundreds of people who were involved in Catalonia’s attempt at independence will be granted amnesty. In exchange for this amnesty, the Junts and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya will support Sanchez and form a coalition government. On Thursday November 16th, Prime Minister Sanchez has been confirmed for another term. European Commission President Von Der LeyencongratulatedSanchez on another term as she does with the confirmation of every European leader, but many Spaniards will not be celebrating.
Partido Popular won the most support from Spaniards at the polls onJuly 23rd, they were unsuccessful in building a ruling coalition, which is necessary considering the party did not win a high enough percentage of the votes to rule alone. Partido Popular attempted to negotiate with other parties but failed to get enough members of Parliament to back their bid. This has led to current Prime Minister Sanchez’s controversial efforts in order to avoid another election. This has led to him having to offer significant concessions which has resulted in major protests throughout the nation as Spaniards are concerned about the consequences of this amnesty law.
While Prime Minister Sanchez is attempting to rationalize his decision to grant amnesty as a way to unify the nation, his opposition views it much differently. People who attempted to help Catalonia secede from Spain will be excused for their crimes instead of punished. The amnesty law is expected to apply to as many as1,500 people. The law will have to name each individual in order to not be considered a mass pardon, which is illegal in Spain. It is unclear how this will help unify Spain considering that confirmation that Catalonia will not attempt to secede again may not be a condition of the amnesty law. According to recent polls, a majority of Spaniards are opposed to amnesty. The reality is that Spain saw a lot of violence as a result of Catalonia’s attempt to break away from Spain yet now politicians and citizens may not have to serve even a day in prison for their crimes.Alex Ramon, a delivery driver who claims to be innocent and not have lit a trash bin on fire, sees amnesty as moral justice. Obviously he would benefit from likely not having to spend time in prison as a result of the amnesty law but it begs to ask how is it justice to allow Spaniards to break national law through a secession attempt.
Sanchez will also face opposition to passing legislation. While several small parties are supporting him, it already has been clarified that their members in Parliament will not vote in support of each bill Sanchez will put forward. This would result in Sanchez holding onto power, yet unable to move forward with his vision for the nation. As Spain currently has the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, the nation cannot afford to have an unproductive four years until the next election in 2027. This would potentially mean Spain falling behind other European Union member states economically and continued brain drain for Spain. If these four years are unproductive, Sanchez also risks fueling support for the far-right in Spain for the next election and weaken support for PSOE. As it currently stands, it is clear that people in Catalonia who are pro-independence believe amnesty legitimizes their movement. If Sanchez is unable to compromise on legislation with these smaller radical parties, he risks inspiring another sedition attempt in Catalonia if people become convinced once again that Catalonia which has a higher regional GDP per capita than average in Spain would be better economically if it was its own nation. This also ignores the reality that Catalonia would find itself outside of the European Union and having to create its own currency and international trade deals while it tries to renegotiate its way back into the European Union. Each prospective candidate nation must receive unanimous approval, meaning Spain would have to approve Catalonia’s request as well.
As has been witnessed in other nations, yet another politician acted in their self-interest rather than for the good of the people. Prime Minister Sanchez may have received enough votes to remain in power and avoid another election on January 14th, but he should ask himself at what cost. When political tensions are at an all-time high not only in world, but particularly in Spain. While Sanchez will be Prime Minister for another term, he will likely struggle to produce positive results as the parties that make up the coalition have widely different ideas. Time will tell if Sanchez made a decision that is beneficial for Spain, or only himself. Those dreaming of independence in Catalonia are very naïve and do have not thoroughly thought-out what independence would truly mean for the region. While Catalonia is prosperous in Spain, it would struggle outside the European Union, an immediate consequence of secession from Spain.Please Read The Following For More Information:

The End of the Age of Armor,"War is an ever changing science that has been defined by many strategic thinkers forgenerations. At the dawn of the millennium, some wrote of arevolution in military affairs. Other prominent strategists have conceptualized warfare as beingdefinedby a dialectic between the primacy of attack or defense, primacy being facilitated by new technology or method – such as the railway, the machine gun, or the tank. Contemporary students of war may be familiar with doctrinal concepts such asAirland Battle,Deep Operations,Unified Land Operations, etc.
The current conflict in Ukraine has signaled the end of a chapter in military science that began in1916and culminated in the Russian assault uponAvdiivka– that of the armored thrust. Breaking the stalemate on the western front, tanks have been at the forefront of military science and dominated the formulations ofHeinz Guderian,Georgii Isserson, as well as defining the contours of the thought of more contemporary theorists such asJohn Boyd– contributing speed and depth to ground operations. Bakhmut, the failed Spring (Counter) Offensive, and the Russian Division sized assault on Avdiivka demonstrate the primacy of the tank as the principal exploitation force for modern operations is over. This does not mean that the tank will depart from the battlefield, just as cavalry remained a major element of the Second World War despite being overturned as the force of decision in WW1 and the Soviet-Polish War, the tank will remain a useful and dynamic element of military operations – but it has ceased to be the principal force for maneuver as conceptualized in the 20th century.
Bakhmut has multiple layers of significance for the conflict in Ukraine. To Ukraine and supporters, it is a symbol of heroic resistance in the face of insurmountable odds. For Russia and supporters of the Russian Federation, it is the demonstration of the folly of Zelensky – a military disaster for the Ukrainian Ground Forces prolonged for politics and media operations. On the military science dimension, it is a significant victory for the Russian Federation, attriting Ukrainian Units that were no doubt destined for the long-heralded Spring Offensive. Waged with proxy and irregular forces, Bakhmut, while a human tragedy by contemporary standards, was a military victory for the Russian Federation predicated upon tried and true operational principles – a three sided encirclement that was intended to attrit enemy reserves by destroying units as they entered and exited the battlespace.
Here, Ukraine attempted to leverage valuable Tank, IFV, and APC elements to alleviate the partially encircled garrison. The infamoushighway of deathsignifies that no longer, as in 1917, can armor brave the fire of the enemy to provide a vital lifeline or offensive spreadhead. There have been many articles and studies on the enhanced lethality of modern ATGMs, which have proven anathema to modern tanks from Ukraine to Gaza, reducing Leopards, Merkavas, and T-90s alike to burning hulks. Artillery, the longtime primary arm of the Russian military, also claimed many Ukrainian platforms. The decisive element in Bakhmut was the widespread use of loitering munitions and drones as an element of combined arms; drones allow the near real time correction of artillery fire – correction time that in the past could be used by armored forces to maneuver.
These new artillery tactics came fully into being during the Ukranian Spring Offensive. Minefields and flexible artillery to bolster defense is nothing new – it has been the hallmark of defensive operations since the end of the First World War. The Ukrainian Spring Offensive, like the ill-fated German Operation Citadel, spent its armored strength assaulting Russian defenses in depth. Crashing into prepared positions, ultimately losing the strength necessary for further offensive operations. Russian Military Engineering has a long tradition of excellence, founded upon such successes as precisely theKursk salientand other offensivedestroyinginstances such as theBagration Fleches. The Ukrainian assault into the prepared defenses was always going to be difficult, clearing obstacles under fire is a complex and arduous process. With the added variable of drone augmented artillery fire and loitering munitions hunting for targets of opportunity, a significant military problem became markedly more difficult and the attrition suffered by Ukranian units as they entered the disruption zone of the Russian defense was such that further offensive operations were impossible. The maximum offensivedepth achieved(20km) does not push beyond the zone of a Russiandivision sized defense. Drones provided the ability to shift fire or eliminate critical platforms, turning a difficult military problem to a nearly impossible one, ensuring that further offensive (often armored) potential was spent.

Correctly interpreting the failure of the Spring Offensive, Russia has responded with a wide fronted offensive of its own. There are multiple directions, dissipating the remaining armored reserves Ukraine can mobilize, towards directionally different sections of the front. Avdiivka is one of such direction that the Russians have attacked in division sized echelons. The initial northern pincer was conducted doctrinally – that is to say relying on armored maneuver as the primary exploitation force. The scale of losses is surely overblown in the West as it is underreported in Russia, but regardless of degree of inflation or deflation – it is apparent that platforms were lost. While the siege has progressed in a steadily worsening position for the Ukrainian garrison, the critical failure of the early northern pincer to achieve the operational objective of severing lines of communication to the rear has forced the evolution of the battle to be more similar to Bakhmut than Bagration.
The tanks could not capitalize on a heavily attrited enemy due to loitering munitions, ATGMs, and surveillance by drone. Where before Soviet doctrine was predicated on maneuver and speed, contemporary Russian forces have, out of necessity and experimentation, begun the development of a qualitatively new doctrine. The assaults on Mariupol, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka demonstrate the articulation of trends that were inaugurated in former Soviet space by the ill-fated first assault on Grozny. Modern weaponry and the enhanced ability to defeat armor thus provided to infantry and artillery, have consigned the armored thrust as the force of operational decision to the dustbin of history. While the tank will remain a potent and dynamic element in modern warfare, as a result of modern technology, it and the era of combat it defined, has ended. Despite triumphant displays at 73 Easting in 1991, and Thunder Runs through Baghdad in 2003, the age of armor has ended in Ukraine.
Questions:
Does new technology always benefit the defense over the offense?
To what extent is the study of military affairs limited by focusing on World War II as the model of modern conflict?
Is military science and military history separable from political history and science and to what extent is war truly politics by other means?

The Global Fashion Summit: Positioning the Fashion Industry in the Spotlight of the Environmental Crisis,"When faced with the discussion of sustainability, it becomes a common thread to point towards discussions of fossil fuels, recycling, renewable energy, or other similar practices that affect the globe’s ecological, social, or economic health. The first thought or notion regarding sustainability rarely involves ‘fashion.’ However, the fashion industry is responsible for almost10%of the globe’s greenhouse gas emissions and consumes about 215 trillion liters of water a year. With such a drastic impact on the environment and active complicity, oftentimes without awareness, by everyone who shops, buys, and wears clothes, sustainability within the fashion sector has become a topic of dialogue worth raising acknowledgments.
Organizations such as the Global Fashion Agenda, based in Copenhagen, have been established in the hopes of providing concrete change to the industry through policy engagements, impact programs, and collaborative commitments to bring awareness of the fashion industry’s impact on the globe and those implicated in its processes. Ultimately, organizations such as the GFA aim, to achieve net-zero in the fashion industry and champion labor rights and fair wages of those affected, by enacting policy and legislation reform across governments and industries alike. While the GFA hosts a yearly Summit conference in Copenhagen, this year, for the first time, they hosted its Global Fashion Summit in Boston, encompassing the theme “Ambition to Action,” to ‘spearhead the transition to a net-positive fashion industry’ and include North America in the conversation.
The Global Fashion Summit Conference, “Ambition to Action,” held in Boston on September 27th, 2023, mapped out its key themes of policy, retail, and finance while centering the focus on their primary and consistent concerns of better wage systems, respectful and secure work environments, smart material choices, resource stewardship, and circular systems. Inviting leading personnel from brands and retailers across the fashion industry, as well as principal organizations in fashion sustainability and environmental advocacy, the Boston Summit heard from a wide array of speakers – from Jonathan Anderson, Creative Director of Loewe, and Noel Kinder, Chief Sustainability Officer of Nike, to Virginijus Sinkevicius, Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, European Commission, and Rachel Arthur of the United Nations Environment Programme.
With an introductory welcome by Federica Marchionni, the CEO of GFA, and spanning a non-exhaustive panel covering topics and dialogue points from textile legislation and policy regulation to environmental challenges posed by climate change, “Ambition to Action” contextualized the fashion industry’s plague to both environmental and social sustainability, while providing hope and solutions for its betterment.
Textile waste was one of the main issues tackled during this conference. Unbeknownst to most, creating a single kilogram of fabric generates about 23 kilograms of greenhouse gasses. Then, as the garments are purchased by consumers and go on to fulfill their life cycle (being thrown out within the year), such waste not only, creates a hostile environment for the planet, but for the people dealing with the scraps. Called to speak at the conference were members ofThe Or Foundation, a non-profit organization, and public charity working in Ghana to tackle the issue of textile waste in the Kantamanto Market in Accra, where roughly 15 million garments will arrive every week, which not only jeopardizes the environment, but brings danger to young women and girls as they risk their lives to transport them. The organization’s senior community engagement manager, Sammy Oteng, discussed and pushed for the necessity of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations.
Extended Producer Responsibility(EPR) regulations are a guidance mechanism in the process of being discussed at the EU level, which would hold brands financially accountable for their products by following requirements of product, packaging, and labeling designs, as well as sorting and recycling the pieces at the end of its life. In attempts to create a uniform and fundamental environmental policy to place responsibility on the producer, as opposed to the consumer, the European Union is the first to introduce this legislation on such a grand scale, a method supported and called for by the Summit panelists. As the EU awaits to fully implement such a regulation, Oteng expressed a necessity for all brands, regardless of legislation, to begin introducing voluntary EPR initiatives to ensure the real dilemma of textile waste is tackled.
Covering yet another array of legislative and regulatory mechanisms, the conference discussed the European Parliament’s introductory proposal of digital product passports and regulations to end fast fashion. TheDigital Product Passport(DPP) is a tool created and proposed by the European Commission, adding to brand responsibility, in order to make all information on the product transparent and available to the consumer – from its inception, throughout the value chain and its production cycle, up until it reaches recycling.
Similar to an EPR, the DDP would be a digital record to make all necessary information on a product available and in turn, keep brands compliant with EU standards for the environment. As such, Virginijus Sinkevicius, the European commissioner for the environment, oceans, and fisheries, paved this discussion, pressing a concern to address textile waste and framing the necessary conversation around a mandatory need for digital product passports, which brands such as Chloe, H&M, and Coach, have already begun implementing.
Lastly on the regulation agenda, one of the major developments of the discussion was the introduction of the GFA Policy Matrix: Americas. Presented as a means to understand sustainability and social matters policy as it relates to North and South America, the framework is aimed to parallel what is established in the European Union. Emphasizing the main five core values of the GFA (respectful and secure work environments, better wage systems, resource stewardship, smart material choices, and circular systems), this introduction at the Boston Summit brings the American hemisphere into the sustainable quota and establishes an incomprehensive overview for priorities and standards within the fashion industry.
One of the final core introductions of the Summit, came from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in launching theSustainable Fashion Communication Playbook. Initiated in June of 2023, and presented at this year’s Boston Summit, the Playbook is a guide for communicators within the global fashion industry; drawing responsibility away from sole producers and allowing marketers, media influencers, image-makers, storytellers, brand managers, and even consumers to be equipped with the understanding of how to change the fashion narrative for a more positive ecological outcome.
Made up of four crucial columns – handling misinformation, minimizing messages of overconsumption, changing behaviors to more sustainable lifestyles, and reimagining values by enabling consumers with the push to demand action from brands and policymakers – the guide is a support system for communicators navigating the desire of a more sustainable fashion agenda. Making her statement for the Playbook, Rachel Arthur, the UNEP’s lead advocate for sustainable fashion, emphasized the point of overconsumption within the clothing business and finding a way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint. As such, the practical playbook takes advancing steps towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, by giving the communicating figure greater authority to point out unsustainable behaviors.
As fast fashion brands grow and consumerism continues underway, leading organizations such as the Global Fashion Agenda are stressing for brands and producers to take active accountability for their implications in the environmental crises they help cause. By bringing a stronghold figure to the table of tackling climate change, “Ambition to Action” further opened the arena for the fashion industry to take accountability for their environmental abuses and implement mechanisms to reverse the damaging effects. While the GFA hosts its annual Summit in Copenhagen, hosting its first conference in Boston opened dialogue to a wider audience, and involved a new market in the changing fashion landscape. With the climate crisis continuously on the rise and on the radar of the public and policymakers everywhere, it has only proven imperative that an industry that affects the environment at such a grand scale be given immediate attention for necessary improvements.

"(Analysis) Solidarity, Resistance & Liberation: The Afghan Women","While news on this issue has long left the mainstream discourse, the Taliban and their regressive policies for women are still very much in place in Afghanistan. Afghan women today continue to have their autonomy snatched from them, and are still excluded from all political, decision-making platforms. With even the World Economic Forum ranking Afghanistan last of the 146 countries on theGlobal Gender Gap Index 2023, how the gender dynamic plays out in examining the military rule of Taliban becomes critical, where resistance becomes the only means of hope for social justice and gender equality.
From having a Ministry of Women Affairs established in 2001, to not only it being replaced by theMinistry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vicein 2021 but also facing deprivation of the most basic rights, the women of Afghanistan have been the worst affected by the tumultuous ravages of Taliban Rule. The taste of liberation for Afghan Women since 2000 was perhaps the highest during the U.S occupation in Afghanistan with President Bush signing the2001 Afghan Women and Children Relief Act. In 2002, schools opened for girls after many years of forced closure. Women’s political participation was encouraged via grants to NGOs to help women improve the condition of their rights that had been previously violated to the extreme by the Taliban. In 2002, Afghan Women celebrated International Women’s Day with optimism for the future and even the UN Headquarters featured the theme: “Afghan women today: Realities and Opportunities”. But in 2021, all the progress towards women’s rights came tumbling down with the Taliban takeover of the Afghan Government and completewithdrawal of the US Military from Afghanistanin August 2021.
But what did these series of events mean for women? The vile, stringent and oppressive ideals once again reinforced upon women by the Taliban have led the entire world into despair, propelling their position in society back to how it was pre-2001. Afghan women today cannot access education beyond class six, to a gym or a park, or even access healthcare without a male chaperone. Women’s formal political participation has been totally annihilated, as the Talibanreplaced female government officials and civil servants with men.  Nevertheless, to say that the gender dynamics of such intra-state conflicts in third world countries such as Afghanistan are always at the expense of the most marginalized communities, that is women, is an understatement. Women in Afghanistan are today being subjected to what is being called- ‘death in slow motion’ by the Taliban. Hence, it becomes critical to underscore the Taliban’s military regime and its consequences vis-a-vis a feminist lens. A very crucial aspect that feminists have advocated for is that while acknowledging hardships of not only Afghan women but all women stratas in any conflict narrative, we should not turn a blind eye to their resistance and backdoor efforts towards peacebuilding and policymaking.
“If we hide in our houses, they win”.
-Anonymous Afghan woman while giving an interview on International Women’s Day, 2022
The Taliban’s efforts of completely erasing women from political spaces, and now advancing toward their erasure from social spaces doesn’t imply that the Afghan women have simply held back, and are just passive victims as popular narrative might make them out to be. With theUnited Nations Security Council’s resolution 1325on ‘Women, Peace and Security’, the importance of the role women play in conflict prevention, transformation and peacebuilding has been globally emphasized. To recognize that women’s experiences of war and conflict are more diverse than that of men, and how they need to be considered and given space in the rebuilding process, is something that makes an impactful difference. This conversation is left incomplete without discussing theRevolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan (RAWA) which was established in the capital city of Kabul in 1977. Founded byMeena, who was assassinated by the Afghan Intelligence KHAD in 1987, it is one of the first feminist socio-political organizations that advocated for social reform in the suffering political atmosphere of Afghanistan. The root cause of politico-social inequalities faced by Afghan women is the religious fundamentalism propagated by the Taliban, which RAWA has clearly acknowledged. RAWA’s struggle recognized the essentialness of gender-dynamics within conflict transformation, and actively integrated men as partners in their feminist politics. To negotiate the patriarchal structures not only with conservative men but women as well, men associated with RAWA became immensely helpful as they did have more influence to convince the Afghan people.
Over the decades, Afghanistan has been ravaged with imperial forces, civil wars and today, the Taliban again (earlier Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001)- which has severely impacted Afghanistan’s economy. WithAfghanistan’s economy shrinking by 25%since the Taliban takeover in 2021, their further restrictive policies on women’s education, political and economic activities, and other fields, will ensure that Afghanistan’s economic recovery path will not be easy. This economic crisis has also led to a broken health care system, with women being affected the worst. The requirement for women to travel with men means that if no men were available due to circumstances, an Afghan woman can not even access medical facilities. The Taliban forcibly closing school doors for girls beyond sixth grade and not allowing females to access higher education, presses the daunting question of what will become of the next generation of doctors, nurses and midwives. Being a deeply conservative and patriarchal country, the absence of female doctors means that many families would not allow male doctors to tend to their family members. To combat the education crisis, RAWA bravely continues to operate underground, running ‘home-based schools’ and literary courses, with education as one of their prime agendas- however this is no match for university level professional education, and one must mourn at the state of affairs for women in Afghanistan. Another pioneering activist who has been working consistently towards providing education to Afghan girls is Pashtana Durrani. Durrani is the founder of ‘Learn Afghanistan’, a grassroots organization propagating digital literacy campaigns. With formally banning women from even joiningNGOs, the religiously fundamentalist Taliban have made the process of completely erasing women from public spaces quite convenient for themselves, as with no women in political and decision-making spaces, the misogynistic Taliban leaders will quite obviously not combat any opposing women-led views either.
The Taliban have justified their misogynistic policies while hiding behind the shield of Sharia Law, however it became quite ironic when the General Secretary of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation himself condemned the Taliban Government forbanning women from universitiesandnot allowing them to work in NGOsin 2022. It is no surprise that after all prehistoric Taliban policies targeting the women, their cornerstone victory would be complete invisibilization of the Afghan woman. Confining women forcibly not only behind their burqa, but also to the walls of their home, the Taliban attempts to make the Afghan women prisoners in their own country. Therefore, walking without a male member becomes an act of defiance, something which sounds so ordinary to most of us. Setting up feminist political organizations and  civil society groups act as much needed acts of resistance. A popular resistance movement established by the Afghan women from the grassroots is widely known as the ‘Bread, Work, Freedom’, where women fearlessly defend their agency and autonomy. Moreover, women have also utilized virtual spaces to the fullest, with the ‘Together Stronger’ whatsapp group chat being a gleaming example. This group chat is a space for activism, mobilization, gathering solidarity and support towards the Afghan women- and a place to organize their demands. With the Taliban providing no space for formal policy making and peacebuilding to women, resistance and backdoor campaigning became the only way to organize solidarity and plan for the future of women.
The role women play in peace talks is invaluable, with them bringing in their experiences of war and conflict and holding important roles in sustaining peace. Moreover, since women are the worst affected by conflict, they become essential stakeholders in conflict transformation. Countries withextreme gender-gaps in leadership positionshave a much higher possibility of being ravaged by intra-state conflict- to which Afghanistan stands testimony. This is not to simplistically claim that all women are calm and peaceful, whereas all men tend to be violent- as this would be reductive. However,war and the military has been deeply genderedthroughout history, and even the process of soldiering brings with itappeals to masculinitywith slangs such as ‘be a man’, calling out to one’s aggression. Nevertheless, while the debate towards ending the hyper-masculinity of war is different from our focus, one should target towards equalizing the gender structures of peacebuilding and conflict-transformation, to liberate the citizens of Afghanistan. There isno complete reconstruction of Afghan societynor is there credibility of the Taliban government without the emancipation of women. Afghan feminist agencies and individuals today continue resisting the Taliban- fighting for their rights, chanting ‘to not politicize education‘, and fearlessly demanding for reversal of the Afghan women’s invisibilization and elimination from all spaces- be it public or private.

Sudan: Eight Months of Civil War,"Sudan has a long and complex political history, particularly in the 21st century. Following the Darfur genocide in early 2000, Sudan has remained a politically unstable hotpot of civil war, economic crises, and intercommunal violence. In addition, the severe effects ofclimate changeand a growing refugee population from neighboring Ethiopia place Sudan at the crux of political instability. Since April 15th, 2023, the situation has only worsened.
For eight months now, Sudan has been embroiled in a messy and violent civil war between its two military hegemons. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are both competing for ruling power, but in their wake have caused one of the biggest humanitarian crises the world has ever seen. So, how did this civil war come about, and how will it end?
It starts with a military coup in April 2019 which saw Omar al-Bashir ousted as President after almost three decades in power. Bashir resided over Sudan during the horrific events of the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s and was overthrown in a popular uprising, replacing his government with the military-formedTransitional Military Council(TMC). The TMC ruled Sudan for several months until August 2019, when they, along with the Forces for Freedom and Change came together to form a transitional government to lead Sudan for up to 39 months while they prepared the transition from a military to a civilian government.
During this time, the TMC dissolved and was replaced by the Sovereign Council with SAF leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan at its head, and RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (more commonly known as Hemedti) as deputy. For two years, al-Burhan and Hemedti led Sudan together in relative cooperation, initiating a coup together in October 2021 which saw the transitional governmentdissolved, and another military one taking its place.
After the coup, however, tensions began to rise over disagreements on how to integrate the RSF into the Sudanese military. Hemedti initially sought a 10-year integration period to maintain his own influence over the government, however, many army general staff wanted a two-year integration period. This, alongside growing concerns over security, led to an eruption in violence between the RSF and the SAF in April of 2023.
Prior fighting in Sudan is normally contained in more rural areas, particularly in Darfur. However, the eruption of civil war in April was isolated mainly within the capital Khartoum before rapidly spreading throughout the country in the following eight months of fighting.
Both the SAF and the RSF believe they have the right to rule Sudan, with both groups essentially framing themselves as reformists and the harbingers ofcivilian rulein Sudan. However, neither group is cohesive in their beliefs. The RSF – which grew out of the paramilitary Janjaweed, who were responsible for the Darfur genocide – have attempted to rebrand themselves as revolutionaries and great supporters of the democratic process. The SAF, similarly, have rehashed elements of al-Bashir’s Islamist policies within their own army leadership. Both the SAF and the RSF, though, remain the main obstruction to establishing a civilian government in Sudan.
It would be easy to characterize this wave of violence as a simplepower strugglebetween old allies, however, that is not the full story. What we are seeing currently in Sudan may have arisen out of disagreements between the two generals but it has devolved into one of the worst humanitarian crises in history to date.
The Humanitarian Damage
Constant bombardment, intercommunal and ethnic violence against civilians, and dwindling water and food supplies echoes of a time, 20 years prior, when the horrors of the Darfur genocide resulted in the death of 500,000 people. As with most civil wars, civilians are caught up in the middle of it, and Sudan is no different. With fighting initially focused in Khartoum – a prioremblemof a united Sudan – civilians and civilian dwellings have consistently been used as shields by both the SAF and the RSF.
While all of the violence in Sudan has been shocking, the return of fighting to Darfur is a particularly distressing sign withnew reportsof sexual violence, rape, and torture from both the RSF and the SAF.  Women and girls as young as 12 around Khartoum and the country have been abducted and subjected to sexual violence, andAmnesty Internationalreceived reports of women being held in conditions of sexual slavery for several days.
While the SAF has been implicated in cases of rape, sexual assault, and airstrikes in populated areas, the RSF has been accused of re-igniting genocide against non-Arab communities like the Masalit. These genocidal accusations follow a series of significant military victories by the RSF in Darfur. By the end of November 2023, the RSF controlled four out of five Darfur states and had become the de factoruling authorityin the region.
More than 9,000 civilians have been murdered since the start of fighting in April, and7.1 million people have been forced from their homes, resulting in the world’s largest displacement crisis ever. Reports from the village of Ardamata reveal that the RSF launched an ethnically motivated attack against Masalit civilians, resulting in the murder and displacement of the town’s population. Human Rights Watch warns that this is a sign of ethnically targeted killings against the Masalit.
Civilians have been fleeing towardsChadfrom West Darfur which has led to a new wave of ethnic violence towards the Masalit community. Any humanitarian support has been difficult to obtain, with attacks against humanitarian workers in the country. Further humanitarian support coming from Port Sudan has also been inadequate in meeting the needs of the Sudanese civilians, following the closing of all other transportation routes. As the Port is controlled by only one party and following apoor agricultural seasonin the country, there has been no guarantee of vital supplies making their way inland, creating a dire humanitarian situation.
Civilians who have not yet found themselves displaced by the violence are caught between Eastern Sudan, Khartoum, and Darfur, without food, basic security, or basic services. With RSF strongholds in Darfur and SAF bases in Eastern Sudan, many civilians are being pressured to choose sides in the fight. For many, this is leading to fears that Sudan faces a similar fate to Libya. That of tworival powercenters in the country’s east and west.
Peace Talks
While the international response to Sudan has been lacking, there have been some attempts to barter peace between the SAF and the RSF. The African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development have both put forward peace initiatives to little avail.
Egypt has attempted to bring forward demands after thousands of Sudanese civilians fled there.The Cairo Summitplaced forward two demands – for African powers to work towards a ceasefire between the warring military factions, and the focus on creating humanitarian corridors in Sudan.
In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and the United States have put forward their initiatives to work towards peace in Sudan, however, they so far have not been sufficient to create a long-lasting break in hostilities. A second round of peace talks in Jeddah was initiated between 26th October and 7th November, however, both the SAF and the RSF have continued to advance relentlessly. Further, despite both military powers agreeing to establish a humanitarian forum, militias have continued to expel citizens forcibly, and ethnically cleanse areas of Sudan, and are consistently committinginternational crimeswith no sign of de-escalation.
Against the many international crises currently, whether in Ukraine or Gaza, it would be easy for Sudan to fall off the radar, and be almost forgotten. In the face of the flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law that both the SAF and the RSF have shown, it is clear that the international response to the horror in Sudan has failed to understand and address theurgency of the situation.Sudan has quickly become one of the worst humanitarian crises in history, and it is crucial to supply immediate assistance to displaced Sudanese people, however, the international response has failed to rise to the occasion.
Questions:
-Why is Sudan not a prominent issue on the international radar?
-What can the international community do to work towards a ceasefire?
-What can be done to work towards long-lasting peace in Sudan?

The New Normal/La Nouvelle Normalité/新常態: Moody’s Alters China’s Outlook Amid Economic Concerns,"Moody’s, a leading international rating agency, recently released areportsignaling a notable shift in its assessment of China’s financial standing. While the agency maintained China’s sovereign credit rating, it revised the outlook from “stable” to “negative” on December 5. This adjustment came against the backdrop of concerns over economic deceleration, burgeoning local debt, and the exacerbation of financial strains due to the property market downturn.
This move follows Moody’s 2017downgradeof China’s rating from Aa3 to A1, which held a stable outlook at that time. The agency’s decision to revise the outlook now, after nearly six years, reflects a growing pessimism regarding China’s debt risk. Moody’s has slashed its growth forecasts for China’s economy, anticipating a decrease to 4 per cent in 2024 and 2025. Furthermore, the agency expressed a somber outlook on long-term economic growth, projecting an average of 3.8% from 2026 to 2030.
China’s Ministry of Finance swiftlyrespondedto Moody’s decision, expressing disappointment and offering rebuttals to the concerns raised. The Ministry highlighted the stabilization and recovery of the domestic economy in the third quarter, expressing optimism about sustained growth. It also underscored China’s strategies in addressing concealed local debt risks through measures like special refinancing bonds. Moreover, it defended the policy support directed toward the real estate market, downplaying the impact of the property downturn on local finances. The timely and prepared response from the Ministry hints at prior readiness for such a rating outlook adjustment.
However, the aftermath of Moody’s revision rippled through the domestic A-share market, contributing to a sharp decline on the same day. This response reflects investors’ wavering confidence in China’s economic trajectory.
Moody’s downgrade, the first in six years, not only signals concerns about mounting sovereign debt risks but also indicates apprehensions about the long-term outlook for the Chinese economy. While the adjustment may not immediately precipitate defaults among China’s local governments on their public debt, its influence on market expectations could have wider repercussions. Caution is warranted regarding the prolonged perils posed by local debt and the property market, tempering any inclination towards unwarranted optimism or complacency.","December 10, 2023",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/moodys-alters-chinas-outlook-amid-economic-concerns/,Severus Xisheng Wang 王希聖,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The UAE’s Ambivalent Strategy: Between Oil Security And Green Transition,"From November 30 to December 12, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) hosted in Abu Dhabi the 28th edition of the UN-sponsored Conference of the Parties (COP28), the largest global conference on climate change. Following last year’s COP27, held in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, this year’s conference further highlights the peculiar -if not ambiguous- ways in which this region deals with the energy transition.
Officially, the aim of the COPs is to unify the Parties’ efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement: to limit warming well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, and to zero global net carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. However, a rapid and compact transition to renewable sources of energy, in addition to still being a long way off, would be counterproductive for big oil companies, which are instead pushing for a holistic model that includes the continued and sensible use of fossil fuels.The last COP27 had concludedwithout decisive resultsor new commitments on climate change mitigation. In particular, there wasno decisive new measureto ensure that global warming is limited to 1.5°C, and there was no joint declaration in the outcome document to phase out all fossil fuels.
This year’s COP28 thus set off without too many expectations regarding the realization of decisive agreements. Weighing most heavily were the assumed conflicts of interest involving the COP President, Emirati politician Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber. Al Jaber, in fact, is the UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced Technologies. He assumed leadership positions in two pivotal companies within the UAE’s energy sector: on one hand, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the state-owned oil company, and on the other hand Masdar, one of the largest Emirati renewable energy companies, involved ingreen projectsin 40 countries.Regarding the COP, the Emirates thus adopted an ambivalent strategy, presenting themselves as an interested and active stakeholder in the fight against climate change, yet endorsing more cautious positions presented by actors with major oil interests.
The compromise between the demands of actors aiming towards a more forceful implementation of renewables and the interests of big oil companies is clearly visible in the outcome of the negotiations for theGlobal Stocktake, the final document: the Parties finally agreed to a vague “transitioning away,” mitigating what was meant to be a firm call to “phase out” from fossil fuels.Although the agreement in terminology may seem minor, it’s the details contained in prominent statements such as the Global Stocktake that actually express the policies announced by the actors and the stated course of action.According to the declarations, the Parties’ commitment would go towards an energy transition to clean sources and the abatement of emissions; how this is implemented, however, is left to each actor, and the management of the transition becomes, from this perspective, extremely pragmatic.Fossil fuels, constituting80 percent of global energy production, still have a fundamental centrality, and oil companies have every interest in pursuing a transition that contemplates all useful energy sources. Moreover, fossil sources are still the mainstay of global energy security, especially in the aftermath of the global energy crisis triggered by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
While pressure from oil industry stakeholders in the outcome document ensured that an overly strong stance for the elimination of fossil fuels was avoided, this year’s COP did produce some diplomatic successes.First, COP28 opened on the first day with the signing of the agreement that makes operational theLoss and Damage Fund, designed to economically assist developing countries that suffer extensive damage from the adverse effects of extreme climate change. For their part, the UAE announced their commitment tocontribute $100 million to the Fund, inaugurating the funding process.In addition, one of the most significant decisions was the signing of theOil and Gas Decarbonization Charterby 50 companies, representing more than 40 percent of the world’s oil production. By signing the document, major oil and gas producers, including ADNOC, Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil, and Shell, committed to align with net zero emissions targets by 2050 and zero methane emissions by 2030.
The COP28 is the crowning achievement for the UAE in its latest efforts to establish itself as an indispensable player and strategic interlocutor at the regional and international levels. The Emirati leadership has indeed made significant progress in using its wealth to diversify its economy and secure an energy leadership position in the post-fossil fuel era.In particular, the pivot role that Abu Dhabi intends to assume makes use of soft power, projecting its leadership abroad mainly in the trade, energy and technology sectors.Regionally, the UAE can indeed project itself as a pioneer of transition in the Gulf, and energy soft power plays a great role in establishing Emirati leadership in the area. This is a strategy that has already been announced at the national level: in 2017, the Emirates launched theEnergy Strategy 2050, which aims to triple the contribution of renewable energy to 50 percent by 2050, invest up to US$54 billion in the sector by 2030, and reduce the carbon footprint of electricity generation by 70 percent by targeting 44 percent renewables.
At the diplomatic level, Abu Dhabi can actually boast that it was the first country in the region toratify the Paris Accords, making a declared commitment to economy-wide emission reductions and announcing a strategy of zero emissions in 2050.
On the international level, the United Arab Emirates are instead consolidating their economic interests by leveraging the oil sector. The world’s economic and trade pivot is definitely shifting toward the East; evidence of the UAE’s strategic interest in the eastern axis is, at the diplomatic level, itsentry into the BRICS, which is mirrored by a marked increase in bilateral trade with China and Russia. In this perspective, the oil sector is of paramount importance, ensuring the security of trade and presenting the UAE as a reliable partner.According to official statements following thelatest UAE-China meetingregarding new investments in trade, transportation and technology, the UAE is China’s first trading partner in the Arab and GCC countries as of 2021. Conversely, China is the UAE’s third largest global trading partner: the value of non-oil trade between the two countries grew by 18 percent in 2022 compared to the previous year (US$72 billion), and Foreign Direct Investment trade between the two countries amounted to US$12 billion in early 2021.
On the other hand, the rift between Russia and the West in the wake of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict did not shake the relationship between Moscow and Abu Dhabi, which instead reshaped and evolved, bringing benefits to both sides. Indeed,bilateral tradebetween the UAE and Russia reached $9 billion in 2022, increasing by 68 percent from the previous year. Moreover, despite the sanctions imposed by the Western axis on Russia, the UAE has used its neutrality in the political arena to harness all the economic soft power that comes from oil trade: the UAE has emerged as acrucial hubfor the storage and re-export of Russian oil, and has more than tripled oil imports from Russia, reaching a record 60 million barrels in 2022.
In conclusion, the Emirates’ strategy is highly ambivalent, and mirrors a regional reality that is solidly tied to the oil trade but intends to repurpose itself as a global hub for new energy sources for the transition.This year’s COP saw for the first time an international agreement in which signatories declared themselves in favor of transitioning away from fossil fuels. From the Emirati perspective, this is certainly a diplomatic victory that confirms its versatility and credibility in handling high-impact issues such as the energy transition. On one hand, Abu Dhabi’s interests remain firmly tied to the oil sector, which allows the Emirates to present itself internationally as a necessary energy partner for major states such as China and Russia. On the other hand, diplomatic engagement, substantial funding in renewables and sustainable projects confirm the UAE as a pivot actor in the energy transition in the region and beyond.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Greece’s Second Economic Miracle,"Two people pose in Santa outfits in front of the Hellenic Parliament. Source:REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis
Apart from Celebrating Christmas this past Monday, Greece has further reason to celebrate. While it was considered to be the sick man of Europe for the longest time, things are changing for the nation. For the second year in a row, Greece tops the ranking by the Economist which ranks 35 OECD members on economic performance. While unemployment remains higher than all other EU member states besides Spain, unemployment continues to fall. The European Commission expects that Greece’s unemployment rate will finally fall below 10 percent in 2025. In October of this year, Greece finally regained an investment grade ranking from Stand and Poor’s. This is a very important development. Having an investment grade credit ranking makes it cheaper and easier for national governments to borrow money and continue to help the national economy develop. This makes it difficult for nations with weaker economies that typically have a stronger need to borrow money in order to help their economies to develop, yet have less access to funds. This however is no longer the case for Greece.
Similar to other European nations, Greece had a period of economic growth after World War II referred to as its economic miracle. For Greece however, this economic miracle ended with a sharp increase in oil prices. The newly elected democratic government after the Greek dictatorship ended in 1974 caused the national debt to rapidly increase, setting it up for disaster when the value of the economy fell significantly below the value of its debt. The Greek government also lied in order to join the Eurozone before it was economically ready which hurt the economy even further. Despite its troubled economic history, Greece’s economy is clearly entering a second period of strong economic growth which can rightly so be referred to as its second economic miracle. Gone are the days were Greek citizens could only take out600 eurosin cash from ATMs.
Fortunately for Greece, things should get easier due to its new credit rating and as it tackles its national debt. Between 203 and 2020, Greece’s national debt stagnated around 180 percent of its GDP per capita and shot up to 203 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic. This debt to GDP ratio however has come down to 160.9 percent in 2023 and is expected by the European Commission to further decline to 147.9 percent in 2025. Part of its debt that it has had to focus on repaying is loans which helped the nation to function at the height of the economic crisis.
Greece has been tackling its debt very well and has even paid back loans quicker than expected. Last year, Greece paid back the IMF in full two years before expected. Greece has also sent a5.3 billion europayment to Eurozone nations which lent Greece260 billion euros. This payment is for bonds maturing in 2024 and 2025. Greece is optimistic that in 2024 it will be able to send another payment ahead of schedule. This is important for Greece as it helps the nation save interest on these loans. By paying the IMF back two years early, Greece saved 50 million years in interest. This will help Greece be able to focus more on reinvesting in its economy and citizens quicker than expected and help the economy continue to outperform what people thought was possible.
While Greece’s GDP per capita is still significantly lower than other EU member states, strong economic growth is helping close the gap. Currently Greece’s GDP is growing twice as fast as the EU average. The Greek economy is still smaller than it was in2008, yet it is still attractive to investment as the nation has proved that it is committed to smart policy decisions that are helping Greece reach its full potential in the long run. While foreign investors were previously scared off from Greece, Greece accomplishing the near impossible is attracting them back. This is important not only for Greece’s international reputation, but its citizens.
Strong economic growth is important in order for Greeks to continue to find jobs and help lower the unemployment Greece. While Greece’s unemployment rate of9.6 percentin October 2023 is the second highest still in the European Union, it is important to look at how far Greece has come. In 2012, Greece had an unemployment rate of27.5 percent. A 65 percent decrease in unemployment is a significant achievement that should be celebrated. It is also important to acknowledge that the unemployment in the Eurozone is currently 6.5 percent, showing Greece is not far off from the typical EU member state that has adopted the euro currency. Sweden which is considered to have a highly developed economy had an unemployment rate of 8 percent in October of this year.
While Greece has had a very difficult economic period since 2008, the nation has proven itself up for the challenges it has had to overcome. While it is easy to glance at economic indicators and see Greece is still performing worse than other EU member states, it is important to remember that Greece’s economy is indeed improving. Despite having an unemployment rate still higher than most EU member states, one in four Greeks were unemployed just eleven years ago. It is important to analyze a member state’s economy based on historical data besides simply comparing them to other EU member states.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Romania And Bulgaria Partially Join Schengen Area,"Romania and Bulgaria both joined the European Union in 2007 as member states. Since then, they have been impatiently awaiting to join the Schengen area. Romania and Bulgaria will be joining the Schengen area inMarch 2024, with a major catch. Passport controls will only be lifted at sea and air crossings. For the time being, land crossings will still be controlled. For Romania and Bulgaria, there is frustration as both nations have been considered by the European Union to be ready to fully join the Schengen area. The problem is that similar to EU membership, membership to the Schengen area must also be voted on unanimously by member states.
Unfortunately for Bulgaria and Romania, despite being considered prepared to join the Schengen area by the EU, several member states have had their own concerns. Austria is still concerned that allowing both nations to join will lead to a spike in people illegally immigrating to the European Union. The Netherlands has withdrawn its concerns, yet previously, the member stateblockedBulgaria from joining the Schengen area. People attempting to register for asylum are required to register in the nation they arrive in, but this does not always happen. Some people attempt to reach wealthier member states such as Austria, Germany, Sweden etc., in order to take advantage of more generous benefits than those in Southern EU member states such as Greece, Spain, and Italy.
On the European Commission website, apress releasecelebrates both member states partially joining the Schengen area starting in March 2024, as passport controls will no longer occur for those traveling by air or water. However, there is no deadline for when passport controls at land crossings will be eliminated. The statement does highlight that both nations have been prepared to join for years. In fact, the European Commission found both Bulgaria and Romania to have been ready to join the Schengen area as far back as 2011. This contrasts starkly against the Dutch government which pretended Bulgaria was not ready until recently based onfact finding missions. This however is not true. Sadly, the press release does not call out member states that have played a role in stopping either nations from joining. As Bulgarian Prime Minister Denkov pointed out in aspeechto the European Parliament, Russia is trying to divide Europe, which makes integration of the EU even more important. This not only has made traveling more difficult for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens, but also for Schengen area citizens interested in traveling to both nations. This in turn hurts both nations economically and prevents them from economic convergence.
After it becomes clear that Austria is acting out of selfish concerns rather than making valid criticisms about the preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union, a contrast emerges. Poland and Hungary have faced rightful criticism in the past for blocking the EU budget due to consequences for democratic backsliding. However, there isn’t as much public outcry directed at Austria for unfairly penalizing Bulgaria and Romania, thus prolonging their wait to join the Schengen area.
While Austria did not pass controversial judicial reforms as Poland did, it continues to hold EU member states hostage. Bulgaria and Romania are required by law to join the Schengen area, yet Austria is at fault for both nations not joining sooner and now only partially joining. The Netherlands is also culpable for blocking Bulgaria. Both nations should have been criticised publicly for taking advantage of the unanimous vote to allow nations to join the Schengen area, particularly when they were considered to be prepared for over a decade. The European Greens criticised both nations in a blog post. However, over the years, it has been evident from media coverage that this critical view has not been the mainstream approach. This stance of rejecting Bulgaria and Romania’s admission to the Schengen area appears to lack a basis in data.Renew Europealso posted a brief blog post affirming that both nations should be part of the Schengen area. However, the post fails to mention the specific member states that have blocked their entry for years.
Besides benefiting Romania and Bulgaria, Greece would also benefit from the inclusion of both nations in the Schengen area. This is due to the potential increase in goods arriving at Greek ports and then transported by truckers through Bulgaria and Romania to be delivered to other EU nations. However, as land checkpoints have not yet been eliminated, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania will unfortunately not yet benefit from a significant increase in the transportation of goods. As long as land borders are controlled, the same challenges for truckers to transport goods from Greece through Bulgaria and Romania will persist. The three nations announced the desire to connect themselves to one another by building a highway and railway which will be beneficial for the movement of not only goods but also people, yet as the land crossing restrictions remain, traveling this way would not be as quick as it could potentially be.
When considering the period after the migrant crisis in 2016, Greece emerges as an important member of the Schengen area. As Greece was the primary source of migrants back then, there were suggestions that Greece was allegedly not protecting the border but instead allowing migrants to travel through Greece to wealthier member states. The European Union made it clear that a member of the Schengen area can be punished. Greece was sanctioned for not upholding its duties, and the same could happen to Bulgaria and Romania if they are truly not ready.
While EU member states are right to be concerned about how to tackle illegal immigration to the EU, punishing Bulgaria and Romania is not the best solution. Instead the EU member states must continue to work together to stop illegal immigration rather than some member states such as Austria making decisions to protect themselves. Media coverage of this deal unfortunately shows double standards exist in the European Union. When Poland and Hungary are out of line they are rightfully criticised for it. When Austria and the Netherlands unfairly prevent two EU member states from fulfilling a legal obligation, neither nation faces significant backlash.

From COP Host to OPEC+ Entrant: Brazil’s Strategic Diplomatic Dance,"On 30th November, Alexandre Silveira, the Brazilian Minister for Mines and Energy, confirmed thatBrazil had accepted the invitation to join OPEC+, with its membership being effective as of 2024. This was a move that caught many by surprise, both domestically and internationally, given how President Lula da Silva’s government has positioned itself regarding to the climate agenda ever since he assumed power in 2022.
President Lula’s campaign was built on a pledge to “put respect for the environment back at the heart of his action and to restore Brazil to its rightful place on the international stage”. A year into his campaign and Brazil has settled into a respectable role in international diplomacy, both in South America and beyond. The Brazilian government has brokered important commercial deals withSaudi Arabiaand is attempting to brokera deal between the European Union and Mercosur, in addition tosuccessfully campaigning to host the COP 30 event in the city of Belem in 2030. Therefore, in the same vein of a resurfacing protagonist role in international circles, it should come as no surprise that Brasilia would accept an invitation to join one of the most influential intergovernmental organisations. However, it is not as simple as that.
OPEC at a glance
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, is a consortium of major oil-producing nations that work together to coordinate and unify petroleum policies to ensure stable oil markets and secure fair prices for both producers and consumers. Founded in 1960, OPEC’s decision-making has been pivotal in influencing global oil prices and energy dynamics. On the other hand, OPEC+, which Brazil will be joining in 2024, is a coalition of oil-producing nations that collaborate on coordinating oil production policies which include non-OPEC members. In its own right, OPEC+ has become a key player in shaping oil production strategies on a global scale.
Why did Brazil accept the invitation to join OPEC+?
Unexpectedly, Brazil recently accepted an invitation to join the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), despite previous offers during Jair Bolsonaro’s presidency. This decision comes as a surprise considering President Lula’scommitmentto positioning Brazil as a key player in climate change discussions.
The international community may take a skeptical view toward Brazil as the country attempts to lead efforts in protecting the Amazon and place itself at the forefront of the fight against climate change effects, aligning itself with the world’s primary intergovernmental alliance of major oil-producing nations. Even at the surface level, it would seemthe optimism that accompanied President Lula’s election in 2022concerning the previously mentioned themes would be antithetical to OPEC’s goals. Yet, the question persists, why would Brazil choose to align itself with OPEC+ now, and what are the potential implications?
On a fundamental level, there appears to be a quid pro quo arrangement, which is typical in international affairs. Saudi Arabia, one of the leading members of the organization, played a substantial role in Brazil’s membership, having extended multiple invitations to the South American giant on previous occasions, both duringPresident Lula’s previous mandateand that offormer President Jair Bolsonaro’s mandate. The timing of Brazil’s inclusion in OPEC+ aligns with Saudi Arabia’sconfirmationas one of the recent members to join BRICS, further enhancing the influence of this growing intergovernmental organization which already counts established powers such as China in its ranks, as well as emerging powers such as India.
President Lula explained the reason behind the decision to join OPEC+, stating that “ it’s important for us to take part in OPEC+, because we need to convince the countries that produce oil that they need to prepare for the end of fossil fuels”. This statement would be well in line with Brazil’s attempt to position itself as the leader of pushing the green agenda, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, and was made at the recently heldCOP28in Dubai.
The Pros and Cons of Brazil’s Membership
However, President Lula’s statement seems to be in direct contradiction to the plans of Petrobras, a Brazilian multinational energy corporation and one of the largest oil and gas companies in Latin America. Jean-Paul Prates, the corporation’s Chief Executive Officer,reiteratedthat the company would not be subject to any production quotas as a result of Brazil’s status as a non-voting member, and stressed Petrobras’ commitment to its shareholders as a publicly traded company.
Additionally, Petrobras harboursambitious plans for growththrough becoming the third-largest oil-producing company, and Brazil are projected to be the fifth-largest crude oil producing country by 2030. Therefore, it seems that a delicate balancing act lies ahead for future governments in which they will need to maintain Brazil’s commitment to energy transition while transforming itself into a global energy power.
For Brazil, joining OPEC+ presents notable advantages. As a member, Brazil can actively engage in decisions influencing oil production levels, contributing to market stability and optimizing revenue from its oil-dependent economy. OPEC+ membership would grant Brazil access to valuable information on global oil markets, enhancing its ability to make informed decisions and navigate the energy sector effectively.
Moreover, participating in discussions shaping international energy policies positions Brazil as a key player, elevating its political influence in the global energy landscape, which is exactly what President Lula envisioned for the country. However, this is also sure to dent Brazil’s standing among its allies who are also championing the green agenda and sustainable development, namely the European Union. In addition, most OPEC  and OPEC+ countries, such as Libya, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia, are not viewed favorably in the global arena for their human rights records and autocratic governments.
In all, only the test of time will be able to tell whether Brazil made the correct decision in joining OPEC+, and various countries will be keeping an eye as the effects unfold.

Essequibo Escalation: From Historical Dispute to Modern-day Tensions and the Specter of Military Action,"In recent months, a territorial dispute between Venezuela and its neighbor Guyana, which has never been fully resolved, has regained momentum. Despite several attempts at arbitration and bilateral agreements, Venezuela continues to assert sovereignty over the Essequibo region of Guyana, an area of 159,500 km2 that constitutes two-thirds of the entire anglophone country. The controversy, previously of relatively little interest for decades, escalated in May 2015 when the U.S. oil company ExxonMobil discovered significant oil reserves off the coast of Guyana. Seizing the opportunity, Nicolás Maduro the Venezuelan president issued a decree claiming sovereignty over the territorial waters of Guyana, particularly in the Essequibo region. Today, eight years later and with oil agreements already established by Guyana, Nicolás Maduro has intensified his rhetoric on Essequibo by organizing a consultative referendum. This referendum asked voters to support his position on the dispute, reflecting the heightened tension surrounding the longstanding territorial disagreement.
Historical Background of the Essequibo Dispute
The dispute over the Essequibo region officially traces back to the second half of the 19th century, specifically to the year 1841. In that year, the newly independent Venezuelan government contested the territorial boundary delineated by the German geographer and naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk. Schomburgk was commissioned by Britain in 1835 to lead an expedition to define the western border of British Guiana, as the treaty through which Britain acquired British Guiana in 1814 did not establish this border. Subsequently, in 1897, through theWashington Arbitration Treaty, the parties agreed to establish an arbitration tribunal composed of American, British, and Russian representatives.The arbitral awardissued in 1899 by this tribunal effectively validated the Schomburgk Line, extending British control over Essequibo. However, just over sixty years later, in 1962, Venezuela revisited the issue, making adeclarationbefore the Fourth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. Venezuela specifically declared its non-recognition of the provisions issued by the 1899 arbitral award, alleging collusion between British delegates and the Russian judge who rendered the verdict.
This led to an agreement signed in Geneva in 1966 between Venezuela and the United Kingdom, establishing a mechanism for peacefully resolving the dispute. Twelve years later, when the predetermined period for a definitive solution expired, Venezuela refused an extension, triggering a renewed dispute over the Essequibo region. In 1987, Venezuela and the newly formed Co-operative Republic of Guyana attempted to resolve the issue through the United Nations’ good offices mechanism, but concrete results were never achieved.
Following the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela and the rise to power of the revolutionary leader Hugo Chávez in 1999, Venezuela’s stance on Essequibo underwent substantial moderation. This position characterized Chávez’s entire presidential term until his death in 2013. While never formally renouncing claims to Essequibo, Chávez prioritized strengthening ties with regional countries to gain regional influence and counter the United States. It was in this context that relations with Guyana significantly improved, culminating inChávez’s visit to Georgetownin 2004, where he expressed the desire to initiate a new era in relations between the two Caribbean nations.
Building Tensions: Maduro’s Actions Before and After ExxonMobil’s 2015 Oil Discovery
The discovery of significant oil reserves in 2015 undeniably marked a turning point in the bilateral relations between Venezuela and Guyana. However, as early as 2013, with Nicolás Maduro’s rise to power in Venezuela, tensions were already on the horizon. Friction between the two countries substantially increased following Guyana’s initial concessions to various oil companies for offshore exploration. Illustrating the strained relations, in October of the same year, the Venezuelan navyintercepted and escortedan oil vessel operated by a U.S. company towards Venezuelan shores, asserting that the ship was operating illegally in its territorial waters. As mentioned, tensions escalated to a new level in May 2015. Shortly after ExxonMobil announced a“significant oil discovery,”Maduro issued a presidential decree asserting sovereignty over the disputed waters. This prompted the then-Guyanese President David Granger to denounce the matter before theUnited Nations General Assemblyand accuse his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, of intimidating Guyana. Tensions have certainly not subsided in the subsequent years; on the contrary. Ongoing incidents of Venezuelan interceptions of oil company vessels operating in the contested zone, as well as deployments of Venezuelan military near the border, have further exacerbated the situation.
Latest Developments: Controversial Referendum and Military Escalation
The events of the past months represent a dangerous escalation in the long-standing dispute over the control of Essequibo. In particular, the controversial decision by Caracas to organize a consultative referendum on December 3rd, aimed at gauging the sentiments of Venezuelans on key issues related to the territorial dispute, has been highly contentious. According to data provided by Venezuelan authorities, thereferendum was more of a plebiscitein favor of annexation (90%). Shortly after the referendum, Maduro appeared onVenezuelan televisionto present a new official map of Venezuela that incorporates the Essequibo region. Tensions and nationalist rhetoric in both Caribbean countries have sharply increased following the consultative referendum. Not even the CARICOM-facilitatedformal meetingon December 14th in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and Guyanese President Irfaan Ali managed to ease tensions; on the contrary. As a demonstration of this, less than two weeks later, Venezuela ordered over 5,600 military personnel to participate in“defensive” exercisesin response to the arrival of theBritish warship HMS Trentoff the coast of Guyana as part of a series of engagements in the region.
The Unlikely Path to Military Action
The prospect of a Venezuelan military action in Guyana would, according to many analysts, constitute a serious mistake for the Maduro government. It could highlight the weaknesses of the Venezuelan military and provoke global opposition to its territorial claims. This opposition includes not only the international community but also numerous allies of Venezuela, including Brazil, Colombia, and even Cuba. The recent decision by the International Court of Justice in favor of Guyana and thewarningnot to alter the status quo further consolidate the international stance against any aggressive actions by Venezuela. Additionally, China, with substantial investments in the Essequibo region, is motivated to reject any military actions that might affect its economic interests. Economic challenges are equally relevant, as Venezuela is just beginning to recover economically with the lifting of sectoral sanctions by the United States. Globally condemned military action would lead to broader sanctions, undermining recovery efforts, especially in the upcoming electoral period.
In conclusion, although the possibility of military action cannot be entirely ruled out, the evident challenges and severe consequences make it unlikely for Maduro to commit such a strategic mistake, especially considering his resilience through various difficult moments in recent years. Therefore, despite potential tensions and troop movements, it appears that any actual deployment is more of an attempt to gain domestic advantages than a genuine military threat.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Spain Recognizes Kosovo Passports,"Spain took a massive step and changed its mind regardingKosovo passports. Previously being the lone holdout in the Schengen area, Spain will finally recognize Kosovo passports. In 2023, Spain made headlines when it was announced that all Schengen Area nations would allow visa-free travel to holders of a Kosovo passport, except for one. As of January 1st, holders of Kosovo passports have the ability to travel to member states of the Schengen area without a visa, apart from Spain. Spain makes it clear that it still refuses to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Spain is one of five EU member states that still do not recognize Kosovo as an independent nation.
Spain’s decision to not recognize Kosovo as an independent nation is primarily driven by domestic political challenges. If Spain were to recognize Kosovo’s claim to independence from Serbia, it would be difficult for the Spanish government to then simultaneously reject any claim that Catalonia should be independent.
Recently, Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez has taken the unpopular step of constructing a coalition government with a Catalonian party which held an illegal referendum for independence. Sanchez has also agreed to grantamnestyto separatists. This has causedlarge protestsin Spain from political opponents of the prime minister who are displeased that despite winning the most votes, Partido Popular was unsuccessful in forming a ruling coalition. If Sanchez were to go as far as accepting Kosovo as independent from Serbia, it could potentially result in Catalonians calling for independence once again. Spain is careful about itswordingand the European Commission’s website when announcing Spain’s intention of recognizing Kosovo passports phrases it as “Spain recognises, from 1 January 2024, ordinary passports issued by Kosovo. This change does not constitute, by any means, an official recognition of Kosovo as an independent state.”.
Interestingly enough, Spain is not the only EU member state that does not recognize Kosovo as an independent nation from Serbia. Cyprus, Greece, Romania, and Slovakia also refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Each member state has its own motives for not yet recognizing Kosovo as an independent nation. Cyprus refuses to recognize Kosovo out of respect for Serbia’sterritorial integrity. This view stems from its own national border challenges. The island of Cyprus remains split between the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. If Cyprus were to accept Kosovo’s claim that it is a sovereign state, it would be difficult for it to maintain its claim that the Republic of Cyprus is the only official government on the island.
In Slovakia, politicians refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence out of concern what will happen within Slovakia. Part of Kosovo’s argument for independence is that the majority of the population are ethnic Albanians who speak Albanian. In Slovakia, over 500,000 people make up the nation’s Hungarian minority population. There is concern that if Slovakia were to recognize Kosovo’s independence, Hungarian majority areas of Slovakia will demand independence as well.
Similar to Slovakia, Romania is concerned that theethnic Hungarian minoritycould be influenced to seek independence. Romania also cites concerns that recognizing Kosovo could inspire other movements of separatists in the Balkans. The majority of ethnic Hungarians live in the region of Transylvania which is located in the heart of the nation. Having the center of Romania declare independence would have consequences for the rest of the nation. Hungarian Prime Minister Orban has concerned other EU member states by granting ethnic Hungarians in other European nations Hungariancitizenship. Between 2011-2016 alone, an average of 180,000 Europeans per year were granted Hungarian citizenship.
Greece’s situation is a bit different from the others and Kosovo politicians have recognized this as well. While Greece, similar to the other four EU member states previously discussed, does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign nation, Greece maintains a solid economic relationship with Kosovo. For Greece the explanation is a little different. While Greece is not concerned about a region of the country attempting to declare independence if the Greek government recognizes Kosovo, Greece prefers to respect the territorial integrity of nations. When it comes to Georgia, Greece has the same stance and refuses to recognize South Ossetia or Abkhazia as independent nations. This can help explain why Kosovo and Greece have a stronger relationship than the other EU member states discussed, particularly Spain where there is still support for an independent Catalonia. There are allegations that Greece is close to recognizing Kosovo’s independence, yet nothing has been confirmed.
Greece’s delay in recognizing Kosovo as independent may also be due in part to Greece’s relationship with Serbia. Despite being a member of NATO, Greece refused tobombSerbia during the Yugoslav war. As a member of NATO, Greece was required to participate in the military campaign by providing a naval ship to help blockade Serbia. Despite not directly participating in the bombing, the crew of the ship refused on moral grounds. Ritsoudis who led the ship’s crew was expelled from the navy yet still defends his choice. He is seen as a hero in Serbia and his painting is featured in Belgrade. Serbia also offered money to Risoudis afterwards, yet he declined. He found a career as a yacht captain after being dismissed from the Greek Navy.
Unfortunately for Kosovo, it is unlikely that Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain will recognize its claim of independence from Serbia anytime soon as a result of domestic politics. While it is a victory that Kosovars can now travel throughout the Schengen area without a visa, it will likely be a long time before Kosovo will be recognized by all EU member states as an independent nation and able to become a candidate to the EU. This negatively will impact Kosovo which will likely continue to see economic divergence between itself and EU member states. Due to all five EU member states having different reasons for not recognizing Kosovo’s independence, there is no straightforward approach that the Kosovar government can take in order to be recognized as independent by Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain.

THE JANUARY 2024 ERUPTION: DRUG GANGS VS. ARMED FORCES IN ECUADOR,"On 23rd November 2023,  35-year-old Daniel Noboa wassworn inas the new President of Ecuador. Noboa had run a campaign based on boosting employment and reducing the prevalent rate of violence, which had seen thehomicide rate spike from six per 100,000 in 2019 to 25.6 in 2022.But president Noboa was soon to receive his baptism of fire as war between drug gangs and the national armed forces escalated, with tens of citizens losing their lives in the attacks.
THE BREAKOUT OF VIOLENCE
On 9th January, heavily armed gangstersstormedthe TC Television headquarters in Guayaquil during theEl Noticierosegment. The gunmen ordered staff, including presenters, to lie down and threatening to shoot them if they did not comply. The signal was soon cut. This was in response to the wave of at least 30 attacks around Ecuador sparked by the escape of well-known gangster, Jose Adolfo Macias, alias ‘Fito’. Noboa’s administration responded by declaring a state of emergency for a period of 60 days and a curfew. The government described the situation as an“internal armed conflict”, and as such, has mandated a greater role to the Ecuadorian military in stabilizing security in the country.
Onearticle from Al Jazeerastates that authorities reported a disturbing escalation in violence across eight provinces, with at least 23 separate incidents, including the detonation of several car bombs. During these events, gang members incinerated police cars and tragically kidnapped seven police officers. This is in addition to other worrying figures from previous violent incidents, such as460 people being left dead as a result of clashes between inmates since 2021. The situation underscores the urgent need for heightened security measures and coordinated efforts to address the growing threat posed by criminal elements.
WHAT IS THE REASON BEHIND THE VIOLENCE?
Ecuador has seen a surge in drug-related gang violence over the past few years, especially since the outbreak of the COVID pandemic. In 2023,authorities seized a record 220 tonnes of drugs, figure that will not go unnoticed in international circles striving to put an end to the international drug trade. Indeed, over the past few years, Ecuador has become a hub for the international drug trade and authorities are starting to take notice.
Several factors have contributed to the growth of this illicit industry. Firstly, Colombia’s drug production runs along the border with Ecuador. Exploiting the lax security in Ecuadorian ports, particularly in major cities like Guayaquil, drug cartels seek to transport illicit substances to the European and American markets. Moreover, Ecuador’s robust infrastructure streamlines transportation, and its dollarized economy facilitates money laundering. These conditions, favorable to the drug trade, have prompted cartels to vie for control of the region, resulting in a surge of violence that has now extended throughout the country.
PRESIDENT NOBOA’S STANCE
President Noboa has adopted a resolute approach to address the perpetrators, deploying the military to prisons to restore order.Designating 22 gangs as ‘terrorists’, he achieved a remarkable milestone by securing unanimous parliamentary approval for classifying the operation as a military objective. Notably, this achievement is impressive given that President Noboa does not command a majority in Parliament. The decisive actions taken underscore the gravity of the situation and the president’s commitment to combating criminal elements.
In aninterviewwith the BBC, President Noboa stated that “[The drug trade] affects the whole world: the narco-terrorists that operate here have operations in Europe, in the US.” In so doing, Noboa laid the groundwork for accepting help from the international community in dealing with the scourge. Washington offered to send a delegation to Ecuador to assist in stabilising the situation.
The events unfolding in early 2024 have potentially set the tone for President Noboa’s presidential term. Successfully addressing the challenges posed by drug cartels, as demonstrated by his firm actions in deploying the military and obtaining parliamentary support, will undoubtedly be a pivotal factor in evaluating the success of his mandate. Tackling such complex issues underscores the gravity of the situation and emphasises the significant responsibilities accompanying his role as president.

(Analysis) Finland Finds its Footing in NATO,"Finnish President Mauno Koivisto who oversaw the country after the Collapse of the USSR. Source:© Kalle Kultala / Otavamedia
With significant changes within international politics, states must choose their own path forward to best adapt to their new environment. These moments often do not come very often, nor do they pronounce themselves beforehand. For Russia and the Post-Soviet states, the collapse of the former USSR brought very different policy outcomes for the various capitals of the former union. Following Russia’s aggressive actions against its neighbor, there was an avalanche of scholarship investigating where exactly things went wrong.
While there were many such pieces since then, one particular piece has stood out by political scientistStuart Kaufmanwhich was written in 1996. In the article, it documents the choices that Russia could make following the union’s collapse and it details how Russian policymakers could choose a nationalist position which could potentially entail the annexation of Eastern Ukraine among other territories. While this was one of the many positions that could be taken, it is the one which came to pass. Furthermore, the nationalist position is one that Russia took within policy, but contains other positions that it carries in its identity.
The article further details that Russian policy was often a mix of different things, the so-called liberal approach is farther than it has ever been since the late 1990s. This is especially evident with the recent death of Russian opposition leaderAlexei Navalny. With this, Russia will concentrate more on the core components of its illiberal policies and identity.
In contrast to this, Finland pivoted further toward the rest of Europe under the presidency ofMauno Koivisto. This trend continued under the leadership ofSanna Marinwho helped to launch the nation’s bid for NATO ascension. Such developments detail a decision to continue to shape its destiny as it sees fit within its difficult neighborhood. However, the nation must understand the challenges it may face on the road to that objective, especially given recent Russian actions against its interests.
Seismic Shift in Finnish Foreign Policy

Last October in 2023, there were reports of subsea infrastructure that stretched between NATO members Finland and Estonia being damaged by an unknown party within the Baltic Sea. The primary suspects of this sabotage were both that of Russia and China. Both governments denied involvement in the matter. While this may not be news straight off the press or freshly tweeted on X.com, it is important to consider the context of recent developments concerning northeastern Europe along with the challenges that they may face in the near future.
In 2023, Finland became an alliance signatory by having allother membersratify the mechanisms that lead to its entrance into the organization. Finland was not alone in its application to the alliance asSwedenalso wanted to gain entrance into the region’s preeminent security partnership. Sweden’s application to NATO has not been without hurdles as they have faced opposition from bothTurkeyandHungary. Although Finland is now a member within NATO and their Nordic neighbor Sweden is yet to ascend formally, the shared regional history with Russia.
Origins of Finnish Neutrality

In the years leading up to the consequential Winter War, Russian officials such asBoris Yartsevurged Finnish foreign minister Rudolf Holsti and other high ranking Finns to reconsider their neutrality in light of an expansionist Germany. Yartsev also communicated that his government did not intend to wait for a German incursion into the Soviet Union.
The underpinnings of the Winter War would come from a rejection of Soviet Demands by the Finns to cede territory for the defense of Russia against a German invasion. Finnish forces would put up a significant effort against Soviet forces, but were ultimatelydefeatedby the Russians who were numerically advantaged. The result was the annexation of a significant amount of Finnish territory by the Soviets and thecontinuationof Finland as a sovereign state. Relations would further deteriorate as the Finnsjoinedthe German invasion of the USSR to regain territory lost in the Winter War. Post-War relations would be dictated by a policy of credibleneutralitythat would extend into the Cold War. This specific neutrality set by the 1948 treaty between the Finns and Soviets rewarded non-conflict between the great powers and provided Finland a sense of pride in the shrewd navigation of 20th century geopolitics. They put this into practice by choosing not to discuss Russia’s incursions into Central Europe during the Cold War.
Modern Threats from Russia

Since the end of the Cold War, Finland had somewhat retained the policy of neutrality as an official position of their foreign policy, but this did not extend into the realm of economic policy. In the present year it has been nearly30 yearssince Finland has been a part of the European Union. The most seismic event in recent foreign policy memory for the Finns was the Russian invasion of Ukraine which largelyshiftedpublic support in favor of attaining NATO membership. Now that they are in the club so to speak, they must come to understand the sobering view of what will face them in coming years. This threat was clearly communicated by the Russians on theprospectof weapons being moved into Finland and Sweden.
What the Finns Can Expect
While the threat of invasion by Russia is obvious, there have been indications of what sort of threats could follow Finland’s newfound membership. In a non-military context they includehybrid operationsutilizing migrants to sow discord among the states of Northern Europe. Further hybrid operations come in the form ofinterferencein the affairs of democracies through cyber operations that are tailored around Russian strategic culture. To combat these types of threats, the United States hascreateda counterintelligence office aimed at countering disinformation campaigns done by malign actors. This sort of organizational reforms could prove prudent to states on the alliance’s eastern flank.
The staying power of these beliefs can be shown through the examination ofstatementsmade by Boris Yeltsin to former President Bill Clinton in which he asked for Europe to be left to the Russian Federation. Such sentiments which date back to the rule of Peter the Great demonstrate the long-term hurdles faced by Finnish policymakers in the face of Russian notions of regional primacy. Regarding Putin’s invocation of theSecond World Warto justify his invasion of Ukraine, it is clear that this justification can be blanketed to include Finland given its complex history. While Finland’s new status as an alliance signatory, it is unlikely to be invaded, but that does not mean it will be unscathed by Russian efforts to destabilize them. With regard to the military aspects of Finland’s role in NATO, there has been much discussion over the history of past conflicts with Russia.
This scholarship predates Finland’s entrance into the alliance, but it has become more pronounced with the war in Ukraine. While there are some which highlight the potential who point out the potential contribution that Finnish forces can have in the vein of the winter war, there are caveats to be gathered.  Field Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim of Finland in the war was noted to have said they had20 yearsof experience in the tactics of delaying the enemy. The Finns have not had 20 years to prepare and are now prepared for a game of catch up in terms of determining their role in the alliance as well as future strategic culture. Furthermore, the Russians have implemented a strategic culture rooted in decades ofinnovationand continues to display this inUkraine.
A key contribution that Finland has the potential to make is concerning arctic capabilities. This has been something that has beendiscussedby Finnish policymakers. Such a contribution can compliment current Americanshortcomingsin the Arctic domain. However, this is not to be taken into account without Russianaimsin the Arctic. The Russians have moved the region up on their list of priorities as it presents a new economic frontier and place for power projection. Economic considerations are especially attractive to the Kremlin in the wake of the ever expanding sanctions regime placed on their economy. They have completed economic projects in the past such as theBaikal Amur Mainlinerailroad which carried with it military implications.
Finland at a Crossroads
Lastly, Finland will have to deal with matters of intelligence at probably a heightened degree. It was just recently in which aRussian professorwas detained in Estonia on suspicion of spying for Russia. During the Cold War, Berlin was known as acapital of spiesbecause the city was a flashpoint for geopolitics as well as a demarcation between the Free World and the Warsaw Pact. Russia will view the new European landscape as malleable and therefore have a much more broad theater of operations than it did in the Cold War. Finland will have to navigate a far more difficult operating environment due to advancements in drone technology as well as signals technology. Further complicating the matter is that it can face a discontent ethnic Russian population that can be easily pushed into covert activities given the alienation caused by institutionalanti-Russiansentiment.
Finland is now at a crossroads in its destiny as a sovereign state. In the past it pursued a pragmatic foreign policy rooted in neutrality to safeguard its sovereignty in the face of Soviet aggression. While its neighbor has a new name the situation remains remarkably the same. This neutrality served its purpose when the USSR collapsed and Northern European states met this event by ending theTreaty of 1948which long guided its neutral foreign policy. To meet the occasion, Finland must take steps to address the new reality it faces and to not do so would mirror the mistakes made by Peter the Great at Narva in which he attempted to solidify his aims regardless of the advancements that had been made in military affairs. Though it cannot take on Russia alone, Finland must also meet the same determination in Arctic affairs and other domains like intelligence as it had done in its pursuit of neutrality and just as Russia has done in the pursuit of innovation during conflicts.

(Analysis) THE NIGHTMARE OF PROGRESSIVE PERONISM?,"In a historic turn of events on November 19, 2023, Javier Mileiemerged triumphant in Argentina’s presidential election,bringing an end to a four-year era of leftist Peronist governance. The cityscape of Buenos Aires witnessed jubilant scenes as numerous high-class neighborhoods erupted in celebration as the new Libertarian president obtained a crushing victory by an impressive 55% against the incumbent candidate, Sergio Massa.
The defeat of Peronism was the result of four years of a faltering administration. A new political rhetoric was resonating among the voters and came to fruition during Milei’s inaugural speech, in which he aimed to address the simmering anger and frustration within a society worn down by persistent economic crises and instability.With a 211% inflation rate for 2023and40% of the population living in poverty, the notion of dismantling the entire political and economic system began to appear as a rational solution to a populace grappling with an inability to envision any hopeful future.
In such a harrowing context, internal scars were left behind, vividly portrayed by the image of wounded soldiers. In a political entity like the Peronist party, defeat is perceived not merely as a mistake but as a regrettable fault, which automatically  initiates the period of pointing fingers.
At first, the responsibility for shouldering the defeat rested on the former Minister of Economy,Sergio Massa, who had been endorsed by the Vice President, Mrs. Cristina Kirchner,as candidate for the Presidential election.This alliance between Kirchner and Massa aimed not only to secure electoral success but also to diminish the influence of President Alberto Fernandez,whose role in his own government had become by the end of his term almost symbolic.
Nevertheless, the defeat did not mark the end for Kirchnerism.Axel Kicillof, the political protégé of the Vice President, emerged victorious in the election and secured the position of governor for the Buenos Aires province.His triumph solidified the region as a stronghold for leftist and Kirchnerist ideology.
Following Kicillof’s victory in Buenos Aires, members of the Peronist coalition chose to ignore any opportunity for self-evaluation after the defeat in the national elections. However, certain party members, particularly the former Secretary of Commerce, Guillermo Moreno, emerged as vocal critics. The latter is known for his candid and sharp remarks, and was openly critical of Cristina Kirchner’s endorsement of Alberto Fernandez. His critiques started in 2019 in complete solitude, moving towards his most acid declarations in 2023 when he asserted:“Cristina chose the worst; is there anyone worse than Alberto?”
Diverse narratives surround Moreno’s origins.According to the Perfil newspaperhis political activity started as an engaged activist in the National Student Front, a left-leaning faction within the Peronist Party, throughout the seventies. However, in 1972, the front merged with Guardia de Hierro (GH), an emerging Peronist,conservative, and Catholic organization,staunchly opposed to leftist faction Montoneros, whom they denounced as “Marxist infiltrators”.
After the restoration of democracy in 1983, Moreno went on to study Economics at the Argentine University of Enterprise (UADE). Concurrently, he established a hardware business named “Distribuidora América” in the town of San Martín, located in the northern region of Buenos Aires.
Moreno met Néstor Kirchner in 2002, after 2001’s political turmoil and during the Eduardo Duhalde administration. Following Kirchner’s victory in the presidential election in 2003, Moreno was appointed as head of the Secretary of Communications, tasked with regulating telecommunications and postal services in the country. But after three years in the position, he resigned to assume the position of Secretary of Internal Commerce.
Moreno’s time in Commerce Marked a turning point in his political career, it was a period characterized by interventionist policies in the Argentine market as a whole. He became a brutal adversary for the private sector,coercing major businesses to halt repricing in an inflationary process through a coercive strategy.Moreno’s aim was togain the sympathy of the workerswho saw how aggressively he fought against the companies who intended to increase prices.
During his administration, he was also a visible and aggressive adversary of the Clarin media group, aligning himself with the official position of the government. The pinnacle of his confrontational ways occurred in 2010 when Moreno stormed into an executive meeting of Papel Prensa, a corporation specialized in newsprint production, representing the state’s interests within the company. Wearing boxing gloves, he shouted,“Helmet or gloves? I have a helmet and I have gloves. What do you want? There’s a choice between a helmet or gloves because the judge said we have to behave ourselves.”
Moreno’s methodologies left a lasting trauma that lingers to this day among high level businessmen. When Alberto Fernández assumed the presidency in 2019, business leaders expressed concerns regarding the potential replication of a “Moreno” in the Secretary of Internal Commerce. Fernández responded by criticizing the former Secretary:“The last thing I would do is copy measures from Guillermo Moreno; he did a lot of harm to Argentina.”
In the recent election, Argentine politics experienced a notable transformation, symbolizing a broader shift in modern political landscapes. Javier Milei, akin to Guillermo Moreno,initially gained prominence through televised analyses of the economy,characterized by vocal critics of the prevailing status quo and aggressive declarations on the established political order. Recipes such as these involve strong leadership and the advocacy of radical positions which resonate within postmodern societies, seeking to return to a past order in response to the chaos of the post-COVID era.
Moreno has adopted a similar playbook. In the initial days of Javier Milei’s ascendancy, he strategically deployed the slogan of“Starting the Peronist counterrevolution”. His tactics involve pitting the liberal vision embraced by Milei against a backdrop ofconservative nationalismandCatholic ideology.
By acknowledging the disaster of the Peronist administrationand aligning himselfwith the emerging right-wing political sentiment,Moreno successfully obtained the respect of numerousjournalists who lean towards Libertarian ideologies, including figures like Alejandro Fantino.Notably,Moreno adeptly engaged with social media platforms, leveraging viral reels on TikTok and Instagram. This strategy not only helped him disseminate his ideas but also enabled him to connect with the younger generations, in a parallel to the Libertarians’ tactics in 2023.
Simultaneously, Moreno is navigating an internal battle against what he perceives as the co-opting of Peronism by progressive ideals in recent years. According to his perspective, issues such as feminism, LGBTIQ rights, and environmental agendas have emerged as distractions, diverting attention from what “genuine Peronism” deems as the needs of the Argentine people:“The only alternative to Milei’s failure is Peronism. Not progressivism. Not this disgust that has just left. The doctrinaire Peronists, those of the prosperous decade, we are the only solution.”
Axel Kicillof would be the embodiment of these progressive ideals. Additionally, he is conditioned by his role as governor to exhibit some level of responsibility, contrasting with Moreno ‘s display of wild impudence.Such a scenario echoes a similar situation between Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, the governor of Buenos Aires Capital City, and Patricia Bullrich.The latter, now Minister of Security of Javier Milei, secured victory in the 2023 primaries by appealing to the voters with radical and ultra-right rhetoric.Moreno has criticized Kicillof’s prowess as an economist, with the governor having served as the Minister of Economy in Cristina Kirchner’s administration from 2012 to 2015.During his tenure, the government implemented a currency devaluation in 2014,which, according to Moreno, marked the culmination of the “Golden Decade” between 2003 and 2013. As is customary, the former Secretary of Commerce employs straightforward language, offering easily digestible phrases, such as,“(I)n 2001, he was managing a café that ultimately closed due to bankruptcy.”Moreno’s ability to strategically adapt in aligning himself with the shifting political landscape should not come as a surprise given the historical dynamics within Peronism, where internal outsiders have consistently risen to prominence and defeated politically established leaders. History can count numerous examples of such occurrences, such as the emergence of the relativelyunknown Carlos Menem against the powerful governor of Buenos Aires, Antonio Cafiero, as well as theascent of the leftist Nestor Kirchner over the seasoned leader Carlos Menem.
In the realm of postmodern politics, a transformative strategy has emerged, aptly named the “Big Bang approach.” This phenomenon sees politicians adopting populist strategies and radical positions to solidify support from loyal followers, reminiscent of Donald Trump’s pioneering use in 2016. Figures like Javier Milei, Jair Bolsonaro, Giorgia Meloni, and others demonstrate new examples of this political methodology.
It is not casual that X, formerly Twitter, is the social media site that such politicians use to frequently communicate with their radicalized electorate. Notably, the Big Bang approach disrupts and reshapes established systems when opportune conditions arise, resembling the dynamics of a Big Bang. Even Peronism seems to have recognized and embraced this evolving political playbook, marking a significant shift in its recent political communication strategy of “political correctness”.
As Argentina’s political future remains uncertain, the desire for change in society has reached Peronism itself. The new era seems to be guided by the commitment to three foundational principles: God, Fatherland, and Family. This concise encapsulation suggests a return to traditional values and reflects a potential shift towards a more conservative orientation within the evolving landscape of Argentine politics.

UK’s Immigration Pledges Face Reality Check,"On December 4th 2023,James Cleverly announced five future changesas part of a “five-point plan” to reduce net migration in the United Kingdom. Cleverly stated that the package, along with the reduction in student dependants, will result in 300,000 fewer migrants, and are part of the Conservative’s larger pledge of reducing immigration ahead of this year’s general election. According to the House of Commons Library, the five points consist of the following:
These pledges come amidst Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s promise to reduce immigration figures, which as the five-point plan demonstrates includes those seeking legal routes. As Sunak’s tenure as prime minister progresses, illegal immigration has increasingly become a focal point of his political agenda, with particular emphasis on addressing the issue of small boat crossings across the English Channel. In this sense, Sunak has pledged to enact legislation to curb this phenomenon, which is among hisfive key prioritiesfor 2023.
Already deemed a harsh country for itsfamily reunion policies, the UK was placed second from bottom among 56 countries for ease of family reunions in 2020. The proposed legislation is set to affect a wide range of individuals, from those seeking to work in the UK to family members who do not meet the proposed threshold. Both sides of the UK political spectrum reacted with hostility toward the outlined measures.
Experts and political figures warned thatthe five-point immigration plan poses a multitude of risks, such as exacerbating further staff shortages in sectors already deprived of workers, keeping families apart, and damaging the UK’s long-term economic growth prospects. In this regard, Christina McAnea, the General Secretary of the Unison Union, stated that the government “is playing roulette with essential services just to placate its backbenchers and the far right.” McAnea went on to argue that if the government “reformed social care as they have long promised, there wouldn’t be such a shortage of workers.”
Meanwhile, Conservative MPs George Eustice and Steve Brine, the Tory chair of the Health Select Committee, took critical stances against the five-point plan. Eustice stated that the government ought to move away from the skills-based migration policy as it “gives preferential access” to sectors such as banking and law, whilst making it “very difficult to recruit the people we do need” for sectors such as care, food, manufacturing, and tourism. Likewise, Brine, after arguing that adult social care vacancies had fallen to 152,000, asked “who did ministers consult ahead of today’s legal migration announcement?”
But with a general electioncoming this year, which the Tories are widely expected to lose, commentators are doubtful that Cleverly’s five-point plan will come to full fruition, though some measures may last. Whilst Cleverly’s counterpart, Labour MP and Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper,denounced the five-point plan after Cleverly’s speech, Labour has not ruled out overhauling these measures should they achieve their much-expected general election victory. Cooper stated that while net migration “should come down”, the announcement was “an admission of years of Tory failure on both the immigration system and the economy”.
Attempts to Deter
Alongside the proposed measures set out in the five-point plan, at the centre of Sunak’s attempt to reduce immigration is the so-called “Rwanda Scheme”.First introduced in 2022by the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Rwanda Scheme is a proposed partnership between the UK and the east-central African nation which aims to deport asylum seekers for processing and settlement. Ministers who support the scheme state that it would help in deterring would-be immigrants from crossing the English Channel on small boats.
When announced, commentators suggested that the scheme was in close announcement with one of Johnson’s key arguments in advocating for Brexit and, namely the notion of “taking back control” of UK borders. However, questions and doubts surround the reality of enacting the Rwanda Scheme.
Following Johnson’s announcement, Matthew Rycroft, the most senior Home Office civil servant at the Home Office,wrote a letter to the then Home Secretary, Priti Patel,expressing scepticism about the scheme’s potential to provide value for money. Rycroft highlighted that there was a dearth of “sufficient evidence” available to substantiate its efficacy.
Although the UK governmenthas so far paid Rwanda £240m for the scheme, with a further £50m expected during the 2024-25 financial year, no asylum seeker has yet made the journey. Rwandan President Paul Kagameoffered to return the money paid by the UKin the event of no asylum seekers being sent. The first flight to Rwanda was scheduled to depart in June 2022, but was stopped moments before its departure due to a late intervention from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The scheme has come under scrutiny for its potential human rights violations, such as in November 2023,when the UK Supreme Court ruled the scheme to be unlawful“as deporting migrants to Rwanda would breach British and international human rights laws and agreements.”
The declaration of the Rwanda scheme as unlawful prompted Sunak to revise the scheme and negotiate a new treaty with Rwanda. This initiative culminated in the introduction of the new Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, designed to declare Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers. The bill passed the House of Commons but failed in the House of Lordsafter peers voted to delay the new schemeuntil Rwanda improves its asylum procedures.
Endgame Desperation: Conclusion
Amidst such uncertainty, it seems that Sunak and his administration are placing their efforts into political gestures and rhetoric as opposed to ensuring the deliverance of policies. In the context of the Rwanda Scheme, Simon Kuper of the Financial Times states thatthe Prime Minister is placing his remaining political capitalon “an expensive, impractical and illegal scheme to deport asylum-seekers”. Meanwhile, the UK electorate remains divided on the issue. Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, stated that Labour and Conservative supportersdiffer substantially when it comes to migration. “We’ve seen the salience of migration go from about 10% to about 50% among Conservative supporters, but from about 8% to about 10% among Labour supporters” Ford said.
What the five-point plan and the Rwanda Scheme demonstrate are the Conservative’s attempts to appease concerns over migration in light of the upcoming general election. But akin tothe so-called culture war, it is doubtful that both approaches are effective strategies in attempting to boost their electoral prospects amidst dire polling performances. Division remains over the five-point plan and the potential further damage it will cause labouring shortages and the economy, as well as the risk of separating families. At the same time, the Rwanda Scheme, which approaches the second anniversary since its announcement, remains inoperative.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Spanish PM Sanchez Faces Surprising Political Setback,"Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez’s ruling coalition is already showing cracks. An extremely controversial amnesty bill wasnarrowly defeatedin The Spanish parliament, after 179 members voted against it and 171 members voted for it. This came as a surprise as the bill was expected to pass; however, the Junts, a pro-independence party from Catalonia, demanded additional amendments at the last minute before the vote. When the amendments were not added, they voted against the bill. The harsh reality is that even though the legislation has faced criticism over the perception of weakening the unity of Spain, the measure surprisingly lost due to politicians who were expected to support the measure.
Members of parliament argue that the law doesn’t go far enough to protect Carles Puigdemont, an exiled politician from Catalonia, member of the European Parliament and who currently lives in Belgium from punishment for his role in Catalonia’s illegal secession attempt from Spain. Members of PSOE, Prime Minister Sanchez’s political party have made it clear however, that the amnesty law will respect the 1978 Spanish constitution and that the Junts are asking too much through proposed amendments.
This legislation was the key to Prime Minister Sanchez receiving enough votes in order to form a coalition government, despite receiving less votes than Partido Popular in the last parliamentary election in July 2023. If Sanchez fails to create an amnesty bill that will gain enough support in Parliament, he likely risks the coalition government falling apart. As the amnesty bill has faced an immense amount of backlash from the Spanish public, it will be very difficult to create a version that will satisfy politicians who failed to create an independent Catalonian nation. The coalition now must decide how far it is willing to go to protect people who broke national law in an attempt to stay in power, or let the coalition fail and call for new elections.
Prime Minister Sanchez brought this on himself in his quest to hold onto power. First, he chose to hold the election inJulyduring the sweltering summer in an attempt to prevent Partido popular from gaining additional support before the deadline to hold the election which was in December. He however made the decision to move up the election after his party had historic losses in regional elections in May. He risked the lives of his constituents to stay in power and now he is paying the price. There are allegations that elderly voters were passing out while waiting their turn to vote and in Mallorca voting was moved outside due to the temperature being too high inside the polling station. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of Partido Popular wants to make itillegalto hold elections in summer.
The Elusive Dream Of An Independent Catalonia
Besides embracing the difficulty in passing an amnesty law, the Junts must also accept the reality of how difficult it will be to create an independent nation in the future, if ever. Reflecting back on the column from two weeks ago, Spain is not the only nation concerned about maintaining its territorial integrity and preventing a part of the nation from trying to claim independence. This would result in a significant challenge for Catalonia to re-enter the European Union. As all new member states must receive unanimous approval, Catalonia would have to appease Spain, Cyprus, Greece, Romania, and Slovakia for why it should be allowed to enter the EU as a new member state instead of remaining a region of Spain.
Catalonians seeking independence would also face a challenge that Great Britain didn’t have after leaving the European Union, creating a new currency. While Catalonia currently enjoys its status as one of the wealthier regions of Spain, this can quickly deteriorate if it was kicked out of the eurozone. the Catalonian economy benefits from using the same currency while a part of Spain as 22 nations currently use the euro (20 members of the eurozone and Kosovo and Montenegro unilaterally adopted the euro currency). The euro has been able to maintain a relatively stable value, yet Catalonia would have to create a European Central Bank and establish  its own stable currency.
Catalonia’s Unhappiness As Region Of Spain
While Catalonia should not hope for independence anytime soon, there is still logic behind why some Catalonians are not satisfied with its current standing. This, however, is not all a result of Spain. Some Catalonians are unsatisfied with Catalonians not being able to use Catalonian, their native language as a working language within the European Union.
Simultaneously however, Catalonians are not the only linguistic minority impacted by this. The European Union currently has 24 official working languages and each nation has the right to select one. For Catalonia unfortunately, Spain has chosen Spanish, the native tongue for the majority of the nation. Other linguistic minority speakers of languages such as Corsican, Ladino, Turkish, Armenian are also impacted by this. None of the native speakers of these languages can do work in the European Union in these languages.
In 1978, Spain allowed for the creation ofautonomous communitiesin order to devolve some powers from the national government when writing the new constitution. Catalonia, Galicia, and the Basque provinces were classified as historic nationalities and were allowed to gain autonomy through a quick process. The other regions (apart from Andalusia due to large public displays of support of autonomy) had to go through a slower process to argue why they should gain autonomy. This shows that Catalonia has, at times had a privileged position and that remaining within Spain does not equate to absolute oppression.
Conclusion
Prime Minister Sanchez may soon see his fragile coalition government fall apart due to being tasked with the impossible, passing an amnesty law for Catalonian politicians and residents who contributed to the failed attempt at secession. The coalition government was not constructed with a strong foundation so it is no surprise that the coalition may soon fail, or the current coalition tries to go against the 1978 constitution in order to hold onto their power. Catalonia may not be fully happy currently as a region of Spain, yet independence could bring even more challenges the region is not prepared for and lead to economic challenges. Before Catalonians attempt to become independent again, they must be prepared to be free from Spain, yet a poorer nation trapped outside of the European Union.

Ambushing the Environment: The Russo-Ukrainian War,"The discussion of the environmental impact of Russia’s continuous offence against Ukraine may seem small or purely insignificant in the face of severe abuse of human rights, violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), war crimes,the discovery of mass burials, refugee crisis and other extreme transgressions as accused by Ukraine on Russia. Yet, one must not ignore the brewing climate crisis that rains heavily not only on the civilians of Ukraine but also can transcend state boundaries and contribute to the global climate detrimentally. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 began on 24th February 2022 and continues today. Although Ukraine has reclaimed around54%of its territory from Russian Forces, the scars of the war left on Ukraine’s landscape and ecosystems run deep.
It is reported that more than5% of global emissionsare linked to conflict and war, which is testimony to the growing need to emphasise the relationship between security and climate change today. This unrecognised issue is problematic, as it underscores the consequences of landscape fires, water contamination, global food crisis, and the devastating destruction of biodiversity. Emissions in Ukraine caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War explicitly account for around 150 Metric tons of CO2e, which is shockingly equal to the total emissions of a country likeBelgium.  Hence, this war raises the threat of Ukraine being much more susceptible to climate change than in general circumstances.
The scale of Russia’s environmental offences in Ukraine is so vast that Ukraine’s Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources launched a website – ‘EcoZagroza’, translated from ‘ЕкоЗагроза’, to record these environmental crimes committed by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. This application cum website was developed as a part of the European Union-funded project- ‘Apena 2’ and launched in July 2022. This application gives Ukrainians another platform to hold Russia accountable by allowing them to report environmental crimes they have personally witnessed, such as leakage of poisonous substances and burning of military equipment. It also lets them monitor other ecological indexes. The official website of EcoZagroza furthermore states that the blowing up of theKakhovka HPP damin July 2023 has been, at large, the most extreme act of ‘ecocide’ the Russian military has perpetrated. The explosion, which destroyed11 sections out of the 28 sectionsof the dam, had many negative consequences. It flooded many villages, affected Ukraine’s agricultural sector, and had a detrimental impact on the fish resources that will take a minimum of 7-10 years to restore. It also led to the disappearance of aquatic plants from the reservoir. The nature of the explosion and its aftereffects were catastrophic that they have been compared with theChornobyl Disaster of 1986. It is well known that the aftermath of even a single bomb or explosive falling in an area has disastrous consequences- it leaves the fields burning and barren, releases toxins in the air, water and soil, creates craters in the earth and erases life. Hence, one can only imagine the painful extent of environmental assault, as Ukraine has withstood innumerable explosives that have been pounded on them- burning national parks, forests and hazardous sites. Ukrainian authorities have estimated a cost of almost58,376,767,240 USDof environmental damage that has been caused as a consequence of military action since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
While Ukraine is being subjected to a literal ‘toxic’ legacy by the Russian military, the paradox lies in the pro-climate commitments that the Russian authorities claim for Russia. Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, has committed to Russia reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2060. The importance of fostering and expanding ecosystems to provide a solution to the climate crisis is something that Russian authorities have continuously highlighted. Russia has been a flagbearer of ‘green diplomacy’, yet this is quite contradictory with the massacre of the ecosystems that Russia has been executing in Ukraine.
Global emissions cannot be considered without talking about the elephant in the room, that is, military emissions. It has been claimed that if the world’s militaries were clubbed together as a single nation-state, it would almost account for the4th highest GHG emitter globally. While this article emphasises the Russo-Ukrainian war and its environmental degradation aspect, the entire conversation is left incomplete without further mentioning other military interventions and/or wars which have also wrecked havoc on various ecosystems. How wars and military conquests can affect environments is no better illustrated than the tragicHiroshima-Nagasakiatomic bombing of 1945, which resulted in emitting tremendous amounts of radiation into the air, altering the DNA of floras and faunas, and turning the water bodies into hazardous, radioactive contamination.The Israel-Hamas warhas also ensured a catastrophic turn of events for Gaza’s biodiversity and environment, where the emissions generated within the first two months of the war exceed the global annual emissions “for more than 20 of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations.” When talking about the US military intervention in Iraq, the harmful substances found in the air, dust and toxins released from military vehicles and arms have been intensely detrimental to the environment. Today, according to theUnited States Agency for International Development, Iraq ranks as the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change.
The glaring gap in literature recording the climate cost of war, therefore, needs to be emphasised, as it is the first step towards increased awareness in mainstream discourse and plants the realisation that emissions by fighter jets and explosives do not simply disappear in thin air, nor are they minor enough to not be held accountable for. Circling back to Russia’s environmental offence in Ukraine and its extreme impact on local ecosystems, Ukrainian authorities have been pushing hard to throw the limelight on this severe issue and demand Russia to pay for the environmental damage. Perhaps no time has been better than today for aformal, legal instrument to combat ‘ecocide’ to be formed on an international scale that operates and sits alongside genocide. The universal criminalisation of ‘ecocide’ is the need of the hour and a significant stride towards ensuring accountability and responsibility for actions that eradicate the environment and contribute adversely to climate change.","March 06, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/ambushing-the-environment-the-russo-ukrainian-war/,Tanvi Sharma,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Hungary Faces EU Backlash Over Sovereignty Law,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban once again finds himself in the hot seat with the European Union. This time it is over thesovereignty lawthat the Hungarian parliament just passed last December. The purpose of the legislation is to investigate individuals and organizations who allegedly work to undermine the sovereignty of Hungary. The law will create a new authority tasked with monitoring political interference. Foreign financing is banned for political parties and this new legislation will punish it with up to 3 years in prison. There are concerns that the legislation will be used against critics of Viktor Orban and his political party Fidesz, rather than actually protect the government.
Whether Orban agrees or not, as long as the nation wants to remain a member of the European Union, Orban has to abide by European Union legislation. This is where Orban gets himself in trouble. When Hungary passes legislation deemed illegal by the European Union, it faces consequences from the European Union. The European Union will open aninfringement procedureagainst the member state as a result of the sovereignty law depending on how Hungary responds. First, Hungary received a formal notice from the European Commission and hastwo monthsto respond regarding the concerns that the Commission has regarding the sovereignty law. If Hungary fails to take action, the European Commission can send areasoned opinionwhich formally requests the member state to comply with EU legislation. Based on previous history from Hungary, the member state will likely drag its feet to modify the sovereignty law and force the European Union to take further measures.
Concern for this new legislation is partly over the reality that it appears as a mechanism to help keep Fidesz and Prime Minister Orban in power. The majority of Hungarian media is already pro-government and attacks political opposition. While media can approve actions taken by the current national government that are positive, there is international concern that this is not the case and that Hungarian media is now supportive of Fidesz not because it is always acting in the interests of Hungarians but simply for the sake of supporting the party.
Orban’s antics have resulted in 21 billion euros of recovery and cohesion funds being frozen by the European Commission. This delays Hungary from being able to use the funds to help achieve economic convergence with wealthier member states. The money will be released by the European Commission as soon as the EU institution is convinced that Orban has corrected rule-of-law deficiencies in Hungary. Orban tried to insist that the money should be given immediately, yet this demand has fallen on deaf ears. EU funds have helped fuel Hungary’s strong economic growth since it became a member state in 2004, yet risks slowing down economic growth due to delaying the release of funds by not doing what is required in order to receive said funds.
While Viktor Orban and Fidesz have been frequently criticized by the European Union and the media, this does not appear to have impacted Orban nor his party within Hungary. In the2022 parliamentary election, Fidesz won54.1 percentof the vote, 4.8 percent higher than in 2018. Current poll numbers from Politico suggest that support for Fidesz stands at48 percent, which is leaps and bounds ahead of the Democratic Coalition in second place with 14 percent of support from voters.
Besides blowback from democratic backsliding and Orban dragging his feet to address the problem, popularity for Fidesz may further slip due to a scandal with the now former Hungarian President, Katalin Novak. She did what many consider unforgivable, pardon a man found guilty of covering up sexual abuse in a home for children. Novak was in Qatar on an official state visit but returned to Hungary before expected and resigned on national television. Besides Novak, former Justice Minister Judit Varga also resigned from the Hungarian Parliament and announced she would no longer be a member of politics. She was perceived as the future of Fidesz with a promising political future.
This scandal will also make it challenging for Orban and his party to be viewed as the protectors of children. Fidesz has campaigned on protecting children from the LGBTQ activists, yet it appears his own party has failed children in order to pardon someone found guilty of hiding abuse of children. In an attempt to contain damage to his party, Orban sent an amendment to the Hungarian Parliament to remove the ability of the Hungarian President to pardon people convicted of crimes against children. However this may be too little too late for voters, particularly as Fidesz campaigned on protecting children.
Viktor Orban is free to do what he wants if he is willing to take Hungary outside the European Union. As Hungary benefits from its status as a member state however, this is highly unlikely. This means that Viktor Orban must learn how to play by the rules. If not, Hungarians will continue to be penalized economically due to the European Commission withholding funds from Hungary. It will be interesting to see if Fidesz takes a significant hit in the polls due to the scandal involving Former President Katalin Novak and former Justice Minister Judit Varga. Besides politics, Orban must also seriously do what is necessary in order to protect children from sexual abuse. He cannot campaign on protecting children from LGBTQ activists meanwhile allow those convicted of covering up sex abuse cases get pardoned. While forbidding any Hungarian President from ever pardoning someone convicted of crimes against children is a step in the right direction, there is likely far more to be done.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Greece Makes History While Leaving Italy Behind,"Last week Greece madehistoryas the first orthodox Christian nation to legalize gay marriage for same sex couples. This leaves behind Italy as the sole nation in western Europe where same sex couples cannot yet marry. For many living in Orthodox nations however, same sex marriage may seem like a distant dream. This is partly due to half of all Orthodox Christians living in Russia. In Greece, Orthodox Christians are more tolerant than in other Orthodox majority nations where many still believe same sex relationships should not be accepted. Similar to same sex marriage legislation in the other EU member states, this new law in Greece does not require the church to perform ceremonies for same sex marriages. The Greek orthodox church voiced its disapproval for the law, yet Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis made it clear that this was a decision for the nation, not the church. This is drastically different from Italy where the influence of the Catholic Church still maintains a strong grip.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has made it clear she is a Christian woman and puts a strong emphasis ontraditional families, despite never marrying her long-term partner who she currently ended her relationship with due to some controversies. While same sex couples cannot yet marry in Italy, they have had the right to a civil union since June 5th, 2016. Civil unions allow same sex couples to enjoy the majority of benefits granted by the Italian government to marriage couples, yet not all. One of the most notable examples is that same-sex couples cannot jointly adopt children. Italy may soon pass legislation which would criminalize people who seek to have children through surrogates abroad as surrogacy has already been illegal in Italy since 2004. Those found guilty may face a fine of 600.000 euros to a million euros and up to two years in jail. This has drawn criticism as the legislation would consider surrogacy to be a crime similar to human trafficking and pedophilia. This penalty is unnecessarily harsh and would likely bankrupt a couple simply looking to become parents. It is also important to remember that this ban is not just for same sex couples but also for heterosexual couples as well. To be fair, it is important to point out that besides Italy, the majority of EU member states are against surrogacy.
While eastern EU member states are catching up to those in the west, the topic of marriage is one of the noticeable issues where a relatively clear divide still exists. Except for Estonia and now Greece, no other nation that has joined the European Union in 2004 or later has passed legislation permitting same-sex marriage.Cyprus and Montenegrocurrently do not permit same sex marriage yet allow civil unions. It is very possible that these nations will follow Greece’s lead and allow for same sex marriage as well in the near future, due to already allowing civil unions.
Bulgariawill likely remain the last holdout due to a large majority of the population having a negative opinion of same-sex marriage. Its constitution also explicitly prohibits same-sex marriage, which means two thirds of the parliament would need to vote to amend the constitution. As Bulgaria’s parliament has struggled and has had several elections due to coalition governments collapsing, it is very unlikely that the nation will have two thirds of the parliament willing to amend the constitution in order to allow same-sex marriage within Bulgaria. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights found Bulgaria to be in violation of European human rights law for not recognizing same-sex couples, yet the nation appears to not be willing to make any changes in order to not be in violation.
Outside the European Union, Orthodox majority nations such as Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Ukraine, and Montenegro have yet to pass legislation allowing same-sex marriage and are unlikely to do so anytime soon unfortunately. This is particularly disappointing for supporters in Ukraine who fear people drafted or voluntarily joined to fight Putin’s invasion of the nation may potentially die for their nation without being able to marry their spouse or at least enter into a civil union with their significant partner to protect them legally. Russian President Vladimir Putin is well known to be anti-LGBTQ+ rights which means half of the population of the orthodox world will remain without rights for the time being. As his main political opponent, Navalny died in prison recently, it is unlikely that Russia will see a change in political leadership anytime soon.
It is impossible to view the European Union as a monolith due to how different nations can be despite all being member states. As member states have slowly passed legislation allowing for same-sex marriage, it can be expected that slowly the rest of the member states will allow it as well. At the same time, it is unknown how long this can take which for some nations may very well mean decades before same sex marriage is finally adopted. While Greece made history as the first Orthodox Christian nation to allow same-sex marriage, the majority of people living in Orthodox Christians will not have this right anytime soon, particularly those living in Russia. A lot of this will depend on a shift in the attitude in the society of each nation and whether or not voters choose politicians who are willing to pass legislation that allows for same-sex marriage.

When The Besieged Becomes The Besieger: How Destroying Gaza Could Backfire And Jeopardize Israel’s Foreign Relations,"There is a recurring theme in Israeli political, social and cultural architecture: the siege mentality. The constant and irrepressible conviction that you are surrounded by enemies that want to wipe you off from the surface of the Earth. Israel spent the last 50 years working to normalize regional relations and alleviate the innate tension around the birth of the Israeli State. But now, just as Netanyahu’s government is conducting the most aggressive military operation in Gaza, leaving its people no way out of the Strip, the web of regional relations built so laboriously is rapidly deteriorating, and even the most solid allies are showing signs of discontent.
What if the one who was always besieged, finds no relief in besieging its lifelong thorn in the flesh? What if Israel, by destroying Gaza, is now actually turning newly-made partners against itself? How are foreign relations being shaped by this protracted conflict?
1: The Besieged
The question of the birth of the Israeli State is structurally linked with the need to protect itself. Since the very first day of its coming to life, and even before 1948, Israel had to associate its existence with the undeniable awareness that it was not welcome, and that it had to defend itself by all means from the Arab neighbors who did not recognize its legitimacy. This developed in what Israeli scholars have identified assiege mentality: “a central belief that the rest of the world has negative behavioral intentions toward them”. Truth to be told, the early decades after 1947 were indeed marked with continuous and ferocious wars between the newborn State and its Arab neighbors, who carried the banner of the protection of Palestine. It was a matter of life or death.
However, after the ardor of the revolutionary period, when the Palestinian issue started to lose its appeal to Arab governments, the Israeli strategy shifted towards a perhaps elusive, but more effective approach than brazen warfare: politics. The besieged, surrounded on all sides by states that wanted to annihilate it, found in the political tool a lever to negotiate its existence into the hectic space of the levant. Relentlessly, Israel has successfully worked on normalizing relations with states that had previously pledged to destroy it. Eventually, the Arab states laid down their arms, neglecting the ever dramatic Palestinian situation that no one was willing to deal with anymore. Egypt was the first to capitulate. Camp David, 1978; Jordan, 1994; Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, 2020. The web was expanding. More states declared to be interested in this odd but seemingly fruitful partnership. Does the besieged still feel threatened to its very core, or does this intricate net prove useful in covering its back?
2: The Besieger
The attacks of October 7th caught the world by surprise. An organized attack by Hamas, unexpected by Israel itself, triggered a harsh reaction from Netanyahu’s government: a military response of such magnitude and violence that threatens to this day the very existence of Gaza. While thenumberof Israeli victims stopped at 1200, the Palestinian death toll currently is set to pass 30,000, according to theGaza Ministry of Health– two-thirds of them women and children, and it’s constantly rising. Not a single functionalhospitalis left in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s joint ground and air offensive started in Gaza city and pushedfurther and further south, destroying more towns in its path and inexorably crushing civilians between the army’s advance and the closed Egyptian border. But as continuously stated by Israel’sMinistersandpoliticians, both from the current government and former diplomats, Gaza is only a hurdle to deal with in the decisive attempt to eradicate Hamas from its territory.
3: Scorched Earth
On the international level, mediators such as Qatar and Egypt have tried to negotiate a ceasefire and to de-escalate the feverish situation. This worked a first time, butrecent talks-proposing a more ambitious agreement between the parties- might not yield the same result. In the meantime, the Israeli offensive shows no signs of waning in intensity; instead, the decisiveattack on Rafahis looming.
The extreme and uncompromising stance adopted by Netanyahu’s cabinet has begun to make both old and new political partners feel uncomfortable.
Egypthas barred the gates of the Rafah crossing, openly contrastingIsraeli pressureto accept the growing number of Palestinian refugees displaced. The UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi hasseconded Egypt’s stance, declaring that the passage of Palestinian refugees into Egypt would be an exodus that would dramatically leave room for a permanentdisplacement of Palestinians, forced out of their land.
Israel’s pursuit of victory appears to prioritize its goals over potential normalization with Saudi Arabia. Significantly, Netanyahuturned down a planfrom US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which would have seen Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel in return for Netanyahu’s commitment to giving the Palestinians a clear path toward the creation of an independent State.
Last year, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and US President Biden underscored their enduring commitment to a two-state solution, deemed essential to reach a comprehensive peace in the region. The Palestinian issue was encumbering on the relation between the Kingdom and Israel,already on thin icesince October: Saudi Arabia, already at the outset of the conflict, had spoken out for the two-state solution to be reevaluated. Now Riyadh has markedlyreiteratedthat diplomatic relations with Israel won’t be opened unless an independent Palestinian state is recognised on 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
However, the biggest snub for a government that seems to be absolutely unwilling to come to terms with those it designates as “terrorists” comes from its historic ally, precisely the one you really shouldn’t annoy: The United States.
A rift is growing between US President Biden and Netanyahu, as they seem to openly differ on the issue. Bidenwarnedthat the heavy campaign in Gaza might be undermining international support towards Israel and suggested that theoffensive on Rafahshould not be launched without a credible and executable plan ensuring the safety of the more than one million people sheltering there.Blinkenalso was opposed to any reoccupation of Gaza by Israel as well as any reduction in the size of the territory.
On Friday 23, the Netanyahu administration proposed apost-war planfor Gaza. It outlines an indefinite military control over Gaza, while ceding the administration of civilian life to Gazans without links to Hamas, and doesn’t mention the Palestinian Authority. Gaza would be completely demilitarized and its southern border with Egypt would be closed, giving Israel complete control of entry and exit from the enclave. Finally, the creation of a permanent settlement for the Palestinians is completely crossed out, under the pretext that the recognition of aPalestinian Statenow would be “a huge reward to unprecedented terrorism.”
Such a proposal, which admits no concession or recognition to the Palestinian political counterpart, does not help the Israeli situation of increasing isolation and it further alienates it from the international dynamics, that are instead working to de-escalate and reduce the consequences of the conflict on the regional scale.
Widening the range of international fora that see Israel facing charges and accusations, there are cases brought to the jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice(ICJ). One is filed bySouth Africa, that has accused Israel of “conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to genocide, attempted genocide and complicity in genocide”.Another international case, filed even before October 7th, concerns the legal consequences arising fromIsrael’s policies and practicesin Occupied Palestinian Territory.
One thing is clear: for Israel, there seems to be an inseparable overlap between Hamas and Gaza. The destruction of Gaza seems to be necessary to annihilate Hamas, and the group’s defeat can’t come without the demolition of the enclave. The issue of the hostages has even receded into the background, with growing discontent on the part of civil society.
But a front of doubts and concerns have begun to compact against Israel.
It’s doubtful that the risk of jeopardizing carefully nurtured relationships with key players in the Arab ensemble is worth winning the war in Gaza. The possible destruction of long-established diplomatic ties and the alienation from neighbors, attracted through decades of diplomatic engagement, must be weighed against the unshakable resolution to destroy an enemy yet still so elusive. Is scorched earth all around, even against the advice of historic and powerful allies, a strategy worth implementing in order to settle the matter once and for all, and on its own terms? Such an unwavering approach raises questions about the wisdom of potentially undermining both the prospects of a two-state solution, where both Palestine and Israel coexist, and the diplomatic network so tirelessly built, just to address the immediate challenge posed by Hamas in Gaza.
In conclusion, everything seems to come down to a question of balance and priorities: and Netanyahu’s government has made it clear that this conflict is an existential matter. The former besieged is now the besieger, and it doesn’t matter if, at the end of the day, you find yourself surrounded once again.
Talks, negotiations, hostages, and the cautious handling of foreign relations: everything seems to fade against the impellent necessity to go all in. At all costs.

Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Spain Supreme Court Launches Investigation Into Carles Puigdemont,"Spain’s national court has made global headlines by announcing a terrorism investigation into Carles Puigdemont and Rubén Wagensberg. This investigation is regarding protests organized by Catalonian politicians as an orchestrated effort in response to the sentencing of nine politicians for their roles in the referendum for independence of Catalonia. In the protests, access to the airport was blocked which led to over a100 flightshaving to be cancelled along with peopleinjuredin the protests as well.
As one of the targets of the terrorism investigation, Carles Puigdemont responded in a rather arrogant manner by saying “All I’m missing now is to be accused of having a secret account in Panama,”.
With this response, it would be expected that he must clearly be innocent, but this is far from the truth. This makes it more ironic when he also stated, “The Spanish Judicial Matrix has adapted the maxim of bad journalism: Don’t let reality stand in the way of a good indictment.”.
The problem for him however is that the Spanish national government declared his referendum for Catalonian independence to be illegal. The European Commission confirmed this to be true under current Spanish law. This led the European Commission to not get involved when Spain cracked down after Catalonia attempted to unilaterally declare its independence, but instead considered it an internal matter for Spain to resolve itself as a member state.
The main debate over whether or not the infamous referendum for independence of Catalonia in 2017 is based on the first two articles of the Spanish constitution and theSpanish Constitutional Courthas ruled such a referendum to be illegal.  Because of this, the European Commission was not going to get involved. The Commission likely would have taken an active role if Catalonia was legally allowed to hold a referendum on independence, the majority of voters voted in favor of independence, yet the Spanish government still refused to reject the autonomous community’s declaration of independence.
While the referendum was not binding, it is also important to look at the results. While92 percentdid vote for independence, only43 percentof people eligible to vote cast a ballot. This is a very low turnout for a referendum, particularly for a topic as significant as deciding whether or not Catalonia should secede from Spain to become an independent nation, while simultaneously leaving the European Union. As it stands, only 39.9 percent of the population that was eligible to vote in the referendum voted for independence, significantly less than half of voters. It is also important to point out that in 2022,52 percentof Catalans are against independence while only41 percentsupport independence, 8 percentage points lower than in 2017.
Unfortunately for Catalonians interested in independence, it appears that it has become important to ‘win the fight’ just for the sake of being able to declare themselves ‘victorious’, without thinking of the consequences for the region. First and foremost, Catalonia will not be able to join the European Union anytime soon as a member state if it becomes an independent nation from Spain. This could then consequentially have an impact on Catalonia’s economy. While Catalonia is one of the wealthiest autonomous communities of Spain presently, this could change if it were no longer within the European Union. There is currently immense debate about how much Brexit has cost the United Kingdom economy, which may become the reality for Catalonia as an independent nation.
It sometimes appears that people are allured by the potential to be a smaller and wealthier nation, and Catalonia may envision itself as a wealthy nation of only7.9 million people, instead of part of Spain with over 46 million inhabitants. In the European Union, Luxembourg has thehighest GDP per capitain the European Union, the equivalent of257 percentof the EU average GDP per capita. However, this is not what it seems at first. It’s high GDP per capita is partially due to workers who live in the nation, yet do not work there. Their labor contributions are included in Luxembourg’s economy, yet not included in the population of the nation which inflates the GDP per capita. In 2019, over200,000 workerscommuted to work in Luxembourg from France, Germany, and Belgium. This figure represents44 percentof the Luxembourgish workforce, showing the economy is not what it initially appears to be at a glance. It is important for Catalonian politicians to realize that Luxembourg’s economy is unique due to conditions unlikely able to be replicated in Catalonia, particularly if it finds itself outside the European Union.
It is hard to predict the future, yet it is very possible that Carles Puigdemont and Rubén Wagensberg will be found guilty. Carles needs to work on his composure and take the investigation seriously, otherwise the media could start comparing his behavior to that of President Donald Trump’s in various court cases. Both men knew that the referendum was illegal, yet they went ahead with it. As the national government unsurprisingly did not allow Catalonia to become independent after the illegal referendum, chaos ensued and besides the two being investigated, pro-Catalonia politicians in general did very little if anything to encourage citizens to remain calm rather than wreak havoc. Carles needs to eat a large slice of humble pie before making further public remarks towards the investigation and admit what he did was wrong and illegal. It is no secret that Catalonia will not become an EU member state if it becomes independent, yet pro-independence Catalonians ignore the reality in order to believe in an alternate dimension where they can achieve all of their desires.

The Outcome of the EU Parliamentary Elections 2024: The Likelihood of a Far-Right Wave,"As the June date for elections is approaching, analyses are emerging to try to establish the outcome of the most important European Union (EU) election since 2020. This article looks at some of the prominent discourses among academics and the media to forecast how seats might be distributed among the parties. Moreover, it seeks to analyze if the recent success of far-right parties in various national elections might translate into a higher proportion of far-right members of the European Parliament (MEPs).
The decade post the Financial Crisis of 2008 has witnessed a significant radicalization of the global and European electorate, which has resulted in a far-right “wave” that has swept over most of the continent. The growing popularity of anti-establishment and populist political groups has been hard to ignore. They are no longer on the fringes of politics and have taken over some of the most significant public offices, as is the case in Hungary and Serbia, or France and the Netherlands. Unsurprisingly, the upcoming EU elections are set to be a turning point in defining the course of the Union’s future domestic and foreign policy.
However, warnings of the potential growth of the far-right in Europe are nothing new. In this sense, international media have beenissuing warningsabout the far-right’s rise, even during the 2014 EU elections.
So, given the current political landscape, what are the key factors shaping the upcoming 2024 elections?
According to aforecastby the European Council on Foreign Relations, the coalition of populist and radical right MEPs could win their first majority in the European Parliament, following the growing popularity of the far-right in national elections. Cas Mudde, one of the leading scholars on the study of the far-right phenomena,predictsthat this political group will be a big winner this year, “not just in terms of votes but also political power”, as “the upcoming elections are expected to further mainstream far-right ideas and parties and pull the European Parliament further to the right”. As he explains, although referred to as the “European elections”, it is rather a combination of 27 separate national elections with their national campaigns and parties.
The rest of this article will thus look at three member states’ recent electoral track record to try to analyze how this might affect their choice of representatives in the European Parliament.
In Paris, the French President Emmanuel Macron is experiencing a growing problem from the nation’s far-right star, Marine Le Pen. And he has reason for concern, as Le Pen’s Front National (now known as National Rally) has been seeing asurge in pollsfor over a decade.Some leading contendersfor MEP status among the far-right in France include Florian Philippot, a former advisor to Le Pen, Jordan Bardella, and Marion Maréchal, who all share strong anti-immigration and anti-EU sentiments.
According to apollconducted by IFOP Fiducial, the National Rally, now led by Jordan Bardella, has as much as 30% of the vote, compared to 21% currently held by the French President. Macron’scoalition’s responsehas been to emphasize the radicality of the far-right by calling the National Rally a “spokesperson for Moscow”, and comparing the current situation to that leading up to the Second World War.
Meanwhile in Rome, another battle is playing out, where theFratelli d’Italiais expected to emerge as one of the largest delegations in the European Parliament. Fratelli d’Italia, the party of Italy’s current Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has seen a significant surge in popularity after the last national election in 2022, thanks to its focus on national values and anti-immigration policies; “Before anything else, always and everywhere, Italians”.
Furthermore, Meloni is benefitting from the support of Forza Italia, a mainstream party once led by the popular but controversial ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. It is thanks to this endorsement, thatFdI has gained popularityamong the moderate electorate, increasing its chances to enter the European Parliament. Although initially promoting anti-EU policies, Meloni has since toned down her criticism of Brussels and sought to improve ties with the centre-right bloc (EPP), and the Forza Italia.
Further up north in The Netherlands, once one of the most liberal and tolerant EU members, the far-right electorate has beensurging in numbersowing to economic and cultural anxieties. The country has followed its European neighbors, like Hungary and Italy, in giving numerous seats to what are considered radical populists, and asArmida van Rijfrom Chatham House notes, this is a cause for concern.
To understand why, it is sufficient to scratch the surface of these politicians’ messages and proposed policies.Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch populist far-right Freedom Party (PVV), won more seats in parliament at the last national election than any other party. This occurred by pledging to change EU asylum and migration regulations, and even threatening to hold a referendum on “Nexit”, the Dutch version of Brexit, an idea he subsequently dropped. Although he abandoned the aspiration to leave the EU, Wilders has held a consistent anti-immigration and anti-Islamrhetoricsince the foundation of PVV in 2006. Therefore, it is not a stretch to expect he will carry and advocate these values in the European Parliament.
In view of this political landscape, the“sharp right turn”, is likely to significantly alter European-level politics, particularly the environmental decisions, and other foreign policy choices. Moreover,  the far-right will expand their hold on the European Parliament, but analysts are cautious whether this electoral success can translate into meaningful political influence, as the far-right is not favored among other groupings in Brussels.
In conclusion, it is safe to say that the trends we see in the recent national elections are likely to appear in the 2024 European elections, with the right wing Eurosceptic parties gaining ever more seats. Analysts warn that a significant game-changer could emerge if the European Parliament (EP) sees a right-wing majority for the first time. However,  it is up for debate to see how this advantage could affect coalitions with other parties, and subsequently the role of the EU in international politics.

"Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Croatia, Potentially EU’s Latest Political Crisis","After emerging as a stable EU member following the turmoil of the Yugoslav war, Croatia faces the looming threat of another potential political crisis.President Zoran Milanović of Croatia’s SDP (Social Democratic Party) announced that he will run to become Croatia’s next Prime Minister. He also stated that he would only step down from his position as president if he wins the polls. This now makes 2024 a super-election year due to a new parliamentary election, the EU elections, and the presidential elections.
The Croatian Constitutional Court ruled that President Zoran Milanović cannot run for prime minister without stepping down as the nation’s president. If not, Milanović is violating the national constitution.Article 96of the constitution forbids anyone occupying the office of president from partisan activities. This is because the office of the president is nonpartisan. Even though candidates for president run within political parties, the candidate who wins the election must immediately forfeit their party membership.
His hesitancy to resign from his office likely has to do with the recent polls. Currently, the right-wing HDZ (Croatian Democratic Union) is leading with32 percentof voter support meanwhile the left-wing SDP comes in second place with23 percent. With less than a month to go for the election, there would have to be a 9-point shift in support between the parties for the SDP to win. This is unlikely to happen without a significant political scandal. His own decision to try to defy the Constitutional Court may also harm Milanović’s chance of gaining support.
Milanović claims that his decision to run for prime minister is motivated by corruption from the ruling party, HDZ, a center-right party. Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has faced numerous protests by political opposition accusing him of attempting to hide corruption. Milanović alleges that Plenković appointed Ivan Turudić as attorney general because he would sweep incriminating evidence under the carpet rather than do his job. This is possible, considering that Ivan Turudić is connected to multiple people accused of corruption.
In an attempt to appease the political opposition, the ruling HDZ agreed to dissolve Parliament and to allow for early elections. As the party still leads in polls, this move is not surprising as HDZ is expected to win afourthconsecutive term. Under the HDZ, Croatia entered theschengen areaandeurozone, which is expected to help the party in the election. HDZ originally votedagainstdissolving parliament, yet potentially changed its mind after the political opposition vowed to hold major protests. The political opposition voiced concerns that HDZ would attempt to hold elections during the summer when many Croatians go on vacation and would not be home to vote, or in September because the ruling party could boast about how well the economy did during the latest tourist season.
What is concerning about Milanović’s announcement is this would not be the first time a politician in Europe has taken an opportunity to seize more power. While the reverse of Milanović, Turkish President Erdogan was first Turkey’s Prime Minister before assuming his current position. Through constitutional reforms, Erdogan gained more power yet wants to write abrand-new constitutionto settle a judicial dispute. What makes Milanović appear to thirst for power is the fact that rather than step down as president in order to run for prime minister, he refuses to give up his position unless he wins. In addition, it is concerning that President Milanović also stated that the opinion of the Croatian Constitutional Court isirrelevant. This statement directly undermines the Croatian Constitutional Court’s authority and casts doubt whether Milanović respects democracy. Milanović claims to be concerned abut the nation and views the next election as a way to save the nation, yet he himself refuses to respect the Croatian Constitutional Court.
Milanović attempts to frame his unwillingness to give up his position as president as blocking the HDZ from seizing power of every governmental institution, yet it is important what voters think of the situation as well. Since 2016 when Milanović lost the election and was ousted as Prime Minister, HDZ has polled the highest with Croatian voters. While Milanović may not be happy with his place in the nation’s political opposition, a large share of voters appears satisfied with the performance of HDZ. He presents his attempted power grab as ‘national salvation’ to make it seem selfless and for the benefit of Croatians. It will be interesting to see if voters believe it, or view his campaign for what it is, Milanović attempting to maintain a political career at the national level.
It is possible that Milanović is correct and that the HDZ is culpable of corruption, yet simultaneously he weakens his case by appearing to be power hungry. He could simply step down as President of Croatia in order to run in the next parliamentary election in order to become prime minister, yet because it is not guaranteed he will win, he does not want to risk not having a position of power at the national level. The polls are currently not in his favor If he refuses to do so, Milanović will violate the national constitution and threaten the nation’s democracy. While HDZ is currently leading the polls and Milanović may lose, it is still dangerous that he is attempting to violate the constitution. A national politician should not be calling a ruling of the Constitutional Court irrelevant, as this undermines the legitimacy of the institution.

BRP Sierra Madre: The Waves of Uncertainty Surrounding the Sentry of the Second Thomas Shoal,"The Second Thomas Shoal (China: Ren’ai Jiao; The Philippines: AyunginShoal) is an island in the Spratly Islands (China: Nansha Qundao; The Philippines: Kalayaan Islands) located in the South China Sea, one of the world’s most contentious areas. Since 2023, the number of maritime confrontations between the shoal’s claimants has increased. China’s 9-Dash Line claims it uses historical maps and records. Nonetheless, it is part of the Philippines’ EEZ, as recognized by international law. However, this discussion will not focus on who owns it, but on explaining why it recently became important. Wherein at its center is a derelict shipwreck that has turned into the regional dispute’s geopolitical flashpoint.
The Second Thomas Shoal serves as a vital gateway for both claimants in the Spratly Islands. This is because of the shoal’s location on theDangerous Ground, an area of the Spratly Islands with shallow depths that has always been poorly chartered. Sailing directions for the Second Thomas Shoal state that it is only accessible to ships with at least medium drafts. Until recently, in 2020,sailing instructionsadvised to avoid the area for all mariners’ safety due to the lack of accurate data. However,covert hydrographic studiesconducted by maritime powers in the 1930s demonstrated that understanding the area’s internal sea lanes is critical for strategy.
There are only so many sea lanes to sail between the shallows, which essentially creates chokepoints. These lanes are easily blockaded, making it easier for China todisruptPhilippine resupply efforts. Philippine officials believe China wants to build a military base on the shoal since it is a suitable location. As Philippine officials have noted, the BRP Sierra Madre serves as anoutpostto monitor not only the Chinese-occupied Mischief Reef but also the adjacent sea lanes.
Similarly, the Philippines’ possession of the shoal is an important access point to its westernmost territories in the Spratly Islands. Alternatively, it serves as an obstacle to China seizing the strategically significantReed Bank(Philippines: Recto Bank) Wherein around one-fifth of the area’s12 billion barrels of oil and 160 trillion cubic feetof natural gas are thought to be beneath Reed Bank. This will be a significant economic gain for China, but it is a necessity to the Philippines to solve its energy crisis.
Malampaya, the Philippines’ only gas field, is estimated to run dry by 2027. In effect, it willdecrease power supplyin the main island of Luzon by 40%, leading to severe outages. In addition, the alternative of importing liquefied natural gas will significantlyraise energy pricesnationwide. In these aforesaid contexts, for the Philippines, the BRP Sierra Madre is burdened with the responsibility as its sole stronghold in the disputed region.
With the strategical importance of the shoal explained, it is also important to know how this affects the way the claimant parties act in the disputed region. Patintero is a traditional Filipino outdoor game wherein players race to the other side of a rectangular area without getting tagged. Inside the rectangle, taggers are situated at specific positions to prevent runners from passing through. Similarly, this is what is happening in and around the Second Thomas Shoal. Philippine vessels attempt to navigate through a Chinese blockade to reach the shoal. The former’s goal is to deliver supplies to theBRP Sierra Madre, a dilapidated WWII-era landing ship under the Philippine Navy.
In 1995, Chinese forces took Mischief Reef (China: Meiji Jiao; The Philippines: PanganibanReef), a small island a few kilometers northwest of the Second Thomas Shoal. Former Philippine Defense SecretaryOrlando Mercadonoted that the Philippine government was scrambling to devise a plan as a response. By 1999, they agreed that BRP Sierra Madre be run aground on the shoal to serve as an outpost. Later, Philippine journalist Marites Vitug coined the term “aground strategy” to refer to the Philippines’ policy to deploy obsolete warships to assert their sovereignty.
The plan was successful, but subsequent attempts were carried out far too late, as China became prepared. Manila’s indecision and lack of conviction cost them a significant opportunity. Nonetheless, despite concerns, BRP Sierra Madre stayed, posing a dilemma for Beijing.Article 95 of UNCLOSgrants a nation’s warships sovereign immunity from external interference. Essentially, the ship is an extension of the Philippines’ sovereignty. Theprinciple of self-defense, as stated inArticle 51 of the UN Charter, empowers a country to defend itself in the case of an attack, including its warships. Furthermore, the Philippines is protected by aMutual Defense Treaty of 1951, which is a collective defense agreement signed with the United States.
In simple terms, if China decides to remove or board the vessel and detain its garrison, it will be considered an act of war against the Philippines. In turn, it would invoke the US to fulfill its defensive obligations under the MDT against China. The BRP Sierra Madre still being a commissioned warship under the Philippine Navy gives it alegal characterbased on international law. This not only stopped China from forcefully removing the ship, but it also prevented the seizure of the Second Thomas Shoal.
However, China has an ingenious strategy to overcome this obstacle. As seen with confrontations since 2012, it is common to seeswarmsof Chinese vessels surrounding an island, where they tend to overwhelm the outnumbered Philippine vessels sailing through the contested areas. PLA General Zhang Zhaozong coined this as the“cabbage strategy”, where they use a swarm of ships to form a blockade and seize an island. Essentially, it is to exhaust the Philippines with the pressure of keeping the BRP Sierra Madre supplied and force them to eventually concede.
With this strategy, China does not break any of the aforementioned laws, but it skirts around using“gray-zone tactics”to take advantage of loopholes. This is because they are not directly interfering with the ship and its garrison, but indirectly targeting them by cutting off the supplies. The result is a repetitive game of patintero that does not end until the runner, the Philippines, becomes exhausted and eventually concedes.
In the background of all the tension around the shoal is a power struggle between the United States and China, wherein several states are stuck in between. Experts are still divided on whether conflict is imminent in the Pacific. On the one hand, some feel that the growing rivalry between these two superpowers will make it more difficult toavoid a confrontationin the future. On the other hand, some claim that both nationsare not eagerto go to war because of the potential destruction.
However, what is common among these arguments is how they present the unnerving reality of uncertainty. Currently, all parties are aware of the dangers that may arise from the aforesaid deadly game of patintero at sea. For instance,ASEAN, although hesitant, still wants to maintain the status quo as it is essential to ensure the region’s stability.
What is seen are the effects ofuncertaintyin geopolitics, which experts believe stem from fear, confusion, ignorance, and indeterminacy. This uncertainty creates risks, as parties to the dispute will try to skirt around the limits to pursue their goals. One example would be China’s aforesaid policy of using its gray-zone tactics as part of itswagerto achieve its goals over the Second Thomas Shoal. Even if these kinds of actions seem to steeply rock the stability of the region, these can be described as calculated risks in exchange for great rewards.
As a result, the question to ask amid heated maritime confrontations between the Philippines and China is not if a conflict would occur, but rather how they might avoid it. From the beginning of the dispute over the Second Thomas Shoal to the strategies used in context, what has been addressed can be defined as a risky dance at the edge of uncertainty. The BRP Sierra Madre, one of the first risky moves done in the South China Sea, has become the center point of conflict between the Philippines and China.
At this point, it is unknown whether China would be able to force the Philippines to concede the shoal. Nor can anyone determine today if a risky strategy fumbles into the spark that this dispute needs to open the gates of war. What is truly certain for now, is that the future of the decrepit BRP Sierra Madre and its beleaguered garrison is determined by which among the two nations are prepared to remain devoted and risk the most in the face of uncertainty.

(Analysis) The Mandate of Heaven and the Chinese Dream,"During the Covid pandemic, Wang Xi Ning, deputy head of mission at the Chinese Embassy to Australia,gave an address to the National Press Club, where he said that Australia had “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people” in pushing for an independent enquiry into the origin of the virus. Such comments have become commonplace over the past few years as Chinese diplomats and officials have taken to western social media to voice their discontent with the west, a trend which has become known as “Wolf Warrior Diplomacy”.
This claim that the feelings of the Chinese people are connected to geo-politics raises the question of the relationship between state, nation and people in China, and how nationalism has been utilised by the Chinese government to create a cohesive narrative. This has become known as The Chinese Dream.
The Roots of the Chinese Identity
Confucius is often credited as being the founder of Chinese thinking. However, if we want to understand the root, we need to go back to the early Zhou Dynasty. The concept of theMandate of Heaven(tianming 天命) originates from this time, and is crucial to understanding contemporary China’s world view.
The Mandate of Heaven refers to the early Zhou rulers’ concept of political legitimacy, which they propagated after defeating their predecessors, the Shang, over 3000 years ago. The Zhou rulers argued that they had not overthrown the Shang out of their own desire for power but had been ordered by “Heaven” to restore justice and order to the world. This theory became foundational to Chinese political thought and has remained on the mind of all of China’s rulers up to the present day.
Modern China is no different, and while antiquated terms may have fallen out of favour, the ideas behind them have not. The Communist Part of China has increasingly used nationalism as a method of maintaining social coherence and legitimacy of the government.
A core part of China’s nationalism is the perceived hostility of an “other” (generally the west), which is cultivated through the education system and then reinforced through media channels. Communist party educators promote school textbooks which heavily focus on cultural-nationalist ideologies, selectively repositioning cultural inheritance to maintain national legitimacy. Many of these textbooks extoll the virtues of Chinese civilisation, while simultaneously downplaying the achievements of western civilisation. Among these“national condition” (guoqing国庆) readers, World Treasures, Nations Pride (shijie zhi guibao, minzu zhi jiao’ao 世界之瑰宝，民族之骄傲) stands out as an excellent example:
“3000 Years ago, China already had discovered the compass and gunpowder, far before the European people. 1700 years ago, there was the emergence of paper; 1200 years ago, the invention of engraved printing; while 800 years ago there was the use of moveable-type printing. Other types of magniﬁcent and exquisite metal objects, ceramics and glowingly beautiful, durable dyes are also famous specialties from Chinese antiquity. In particular, patriotic zeal and hard-working spirit have been characteristics of the Chinese nation throughout all time. Because of this, the Chinese people hold a great sense of national self-gloriﬁcation”.
Upon this foundation of instilling a sense of pride in China’s achievements the“century of humiliation”is then introduced. This was a period spanning from the first Opium War in the 1850s to the formation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Juxtaposed against the list of accomplishments and extolls of China’s greatness in times past, this is then framed to incite anger and resentment against foreign forces. This century of humiliation was then used by Chinese leaders from Mao onwards to reinvigorate the Chinese people and create a sense of standing up to injustice.
These concepts are further reinforced in the waystate media represents global affairs. Chinese professional news discourses encourage popular nationalism, especially in regard to international relations or foreign policy discourse related to the US and Japan.
Chinese state media is designed to function in conjunction with education as a tool for state propaganda. It is required to educate the public on patriotism in order to strengthen the state’s legitimacy. This two-pronged approach ensures that nationalist values are instilled from a young age and then reinforced throughout a citizen’s life as their only source of information is, as we have seen above, framed through the lens of the CCP’s brand of nationalism.
In this light, it is easy to see how dissenting opinion or dissatisfaction can be branded as being in opposition to the collective, and perhaps being instigated by outside forces. At the same time, nationalism is used as a tool to ensure that the younger generation are distracted from the excesses of the CCP and instead focus their angst on anti-western nationalism.
Xi Jinping and The China Dream
Chinese nationalism has seen a sharp increase since Xi Jinping assumed office in 2013. In comparison to his predecessor Hu Jin Tao, who continued in the footsteps of Deng Xiao Ping and hiskeeping a low profile(tao guang yang hui 韬光养晦) approach to foreign policy, Xi’s regime has taken a much more assertive position on the global stage. Since Xi assumed leadership, China has taken a much more assertive role in world affairs and its foreign policy has indeed become much more confident, using both “carrots” and “sticks” in setting up the Belt and Road Initiative, but also increasing its military presence in the South China Sea.
The China Dream was not a concept initiated by Xi, it was already making its presence known during the Beijing Olympics of 2008. However, since Xi’s ascent to power it took a much more prominent role in state propaganda. Xi ensured the China Dream was solely focused on creating amoderately prosperous society(xiaokang shehui 小康社会) through upholding the core values of socialism, which you are able to see on signboards all over the country: prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, the rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship.
It is obvious here that this is a very different concept from the American Dream, which is one of individual success through following passion. The China Dream as seen through the eyes of Xi Jinping is one where the individual must play their part in creating this so-called moderately prosperous society. This can be seen clearly just be looking at the list of core values of socialism. It is also easy to see how the China Dream implies conformity to the actions of the state; indeed, it has nothing to do with realising what the west terms “the good life”, or any kind of individual satisfaction or accomplishment. Instead, it is wholy about being one part of a mass which is working together in a coordinated fashion to enact the goals set out by the party.
At its root, the China Dream is also about surpassing other civilisations, and rests not only upon economic growth, but also a nostalgia of the greatness of ancient China, an idea that has been termed “nostalgic futurology”. The China Dream is also framed with nationalist tendencies against the backdrop of the Century of Humiliation, with phrases such as “the rejuvenation of China” and “China’s renaissance” being employed, which would be central to China “restoring its dignity”.
In the“Road to Rejuvenation”Exhibition held at the National Palace Museum in 2012, the overall story being told had shifted away from the Mao-era framing of the oppressed Chinese people as standing with other oppressed peoples worldwide in a unified class struggle from hostile forces both domestic and foreign, towards a narrative of China being a lone victim in a world of aggressors.
Conclusion
While Xi Jinping is not responsible for the creation of Chinese nationalism, he has built upon a long tradition of nationalistic tendencies and brought them together as a uniting force in driving China forward towards his own aspirations. In contrast to the Mao era rhetoric of class struggle and proletariats of the world uniting against a common oppressor, Xi is now transforming the dialogue to one of the Chinese nation being a lonely victim against aggressive foreign forces bent on halting China’s inevitable rise. He has drawn upon the greatness of times past and declared that China is only reclaiming its rightful place as a superpower.
This is all condensed into the China Dream, a concept very different to its American counterpart. Here, there are no gains for an individual, it is all about the state as a whole moving towards a goal decided upon by the party. All citizens must conform to this goal and share the aspiration of the nation. There is no distinction between the individual, the nation and the state here. This is achieved by drawing on a long cultural tradition in which theindividual is defined within relation to the societyand is not an autonomous unit as is in western philosophy.
At the same time, it has been shown that this nationalist model, reinforced through cultural and linguistic habits, brings about an unhealthy relationship with the outside world. This is one built on distrust and suspicion, and a kind of contradictory superiority/inferiority complex, where Chinese people on the one hand feel pride at the complexity and depth of their culture, but on the other hand an insecurity which manifests in the need for affirmation from the outside world.
What remains to be seen is will this model be successful in taking China towards a brighter future? Or is it merely patching together the cracks in a society on the brink of collapse? The next few years will be crucial in answering this question, as how China responds to growing criticism of its handling the coronavirus pandemic, and how it responds to a toughening approach from western nations will be crucial in which of these two questions will be answered with a yes.

"NATO, Russia, and the shifting dynamics of European Defense","Source:Foreign Policy
“Mentally prepare for a war,” said Sweden’s military commander-in-chiefGen. Micael Bydénas the country moved towards joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In an era of geopolitical tension and shifting alliances, the landscape of international security is continuously evolving. The recent inclusion of Finland and Sweden as members of NATO marks a significant juncture in European defense dynamics. As these Nordic nations join the Western military alliance, they find themselves at the centre of a geopolitical chess game, with Russia casting a watchful eye and expressing vehement opposition.
Finland and Sweden applied for NATO’s membership days after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s decision was rooted in crushing the slightest possibility of Ukraine fraternizing with its supposed enemy. However, ironically, the Kremlin inadvertently prompted the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO. The decision by Finland and Sweden to seek refuge under NATO’s umbrella represents a strategic recalibration in response to the evolving security landscape in Europe. By aligning themselves with the Western alliance, they signal a clear rejection of Russian hegemony and a commitment to upholding the principles of collective security and territorial integrity.
Finland
As Finland initiated itself into the Atlantic Alliance in 2023, it received warnings from Kremlin President Vladimir Putin stating that there would be ‘problems’ after the West ‘dragged (Finland) into NATO’. However, this is not the first time Russia has tried to intimidate its neighbour. Finland has faced persistent threats from Russia over centuries. Helsinki’s proximity to Russia placed it within Moscow’s sphere of influence, subjecting it to strategic interests and occasional assertive actions. Finland’s previous non-NATO, non-aligned status made it vulnerable to Russian influence and coercion.
The prime source, still, of the insecurity that Finland has faced has been the lengthy border it shares with Russia. The Karelian question, a recurrent topic, marked the territory as a zone of potential tension.

A more public debate, than a political discourse, the issue emerged in the aftermath of World War II, when Finland ceded the Karelian region (10 per cent of their territory) to the Soviet Union as part of theMoscow Peace Treaty of 1940. Despite Finland’s post-war attempts at reconciliation, the question simmered down. By 1975, Finland accepted the closing of the issue as it approved theCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe document, which denounced any secessionist movements or territorial claims. With the unification of Germany and the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Finnish brought the question of Karelian back on the agenda but to date, the territorial dispute remains unresolved. The Karelian question, nevertheless, loomed in the shadow of Helsinki-Kremlin relations. As Russia illegally annexed Crimea and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Finland’s security has been on the brink of a crisis. The escalating aggression of Russia made Finland reminiscent of theWinter Warand allowed itself to deviate from its post-war policy of neutrality.
Sweden
Sweden, much like its immediate neighbour, had maintained a policy of non-alignment throughout the Bipolar world. Once the bipolarity ended, Russia and Sweden were on good terms. There were no feelings of fear or animosity between the two. Instead, Sweden saw it as a chance to have a positive influence on its Eastern neighbour. Sweden contributed with economic and political aid, which Russia gladly accepted.
However, with the onset of the 21st century, Swedish-Russian relations went downhill. The political ties were at their lowest point with theRusso-Georgian War. Moscow’s move of deploying its military in the pro-Russian militia areas was met with heavy criticism by Stockholm, a reaction that caused scepticism in the Kremlin. Sweden has always been vocal about the violation of human rights by Russia inside and outside its territories.

Similar to Finland, the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 pushed Sweden over the edge to depart from its neutrality, which it held for over 200 years, and join the Atlantic Alliance. The threat of Russia was always there, but it was only after the Ukraine crisis that the warnings seemed legitimate.
It alsorevived fearsof intrusion into Gotland. Gotland, a popular holiday destination for Stockholmers, is a strategic base located just 350 kilometres (ca. 217 miles) from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. Sweden abandoned its garrison stationed on the island in 2004 to scale back its defense. In 2015, theremilitarisation of Gotlandformed part of the defense bill. The process was further sped up with a permanent and immediate deployment of forces to the island. In light of the recent events, the defense planners fear that Russia can seize the base and attack territories of Sweden as well as Finland.
NATO is more geographically cohesive than ever before. The Baltic Sea is now the NATO lake, and the Russian bases and forces of theKola Peninsulaare at greater risk. The increasing deterrence of the North Atlantic has forced the Kremlin to rethink its strategy in the Baltic Sea region. Putin warned the two countries of “serious military and political consequences” as to would be obliged to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defenses in the region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Although a full-scale war seems highly unlikely in the near future.

The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, coupled with the looming threat of Russian aggression, brings into play the pivotal NATOArticle 5. This article enshrines the principle of collective defense, stipulating that an attack on any member shall be considered an attack on all, triggering a united response to safeguard the security of the North Atlantic Area. Consequently, Russia would be confronted with a formidable coalition comprising over 30 nations, should it engage in warfare.
Furthermore, the historical ties between Russia and Ukraine imbue the latter with a significance that Sweden and Finland lack in the eyes of Moscow. President Putin has explicitly cited the protection of Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine as a key objective of Russia’s military intervention, motivated by concerns about their perceived subjugation. Given this, Russia lacks the compelling incentives to target countries like Finland or Sweden, thus potentially averting military action despite its disapproval.
Thus, as Sweden and Finland embark on the NATO path, they should do so with a sober recognition of the challenges and risks that lie ahead. The prospect of Russian retaliation cannot be mitigated altogether, and the delicate balancing act between deterring any kind of hostility and avoiding escalation will require deft diplomacy and steadfast resolve.","May 13, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/nato-russia-and-the-shifting-dynamics-of-european-defense/,Harshita Prashar,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The lessons that Niger and the International Community can learn,"History of Military Diplomacy in Niger
The history of military diplomacy in Niger has recently been shaped by the 2023 coup d’état and the subsequent threat of military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States to restore constitutional order. This situation has brought to light complex legal issues surrounding anticipatory consent to military intervention, through treaty-based mechanisms like the1999 Lomé Protocol. The coup in Niger is part of a series of political upheavals in West Africa and the Sahel region since 2020, leading to concerns about a “coup belt” emerging in the area. The response to the coup  has been multipronged, with ECOWAS imposing sanctions and threatening military intervention if constitutional order is not restored. This has led to diplomatic tensions within ECOWAS and mixed reactions from neighboring countries under military rule. The legal analysis of the union’s threat raises questions about the violation of international law, specificallyarticle 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the threat or use of force.
Military Diplomacy in Niger
The implementation of military diplomacy in Niger following the 2023 coup d’état has had significant implications for the local population and regional stability.
The legal underpinnings of military intervention post-coup demand meticulous scrutiny, particularly concerning anticipatory consent and intervention by invitation. These legal nuances shape the legitimacy of external involvement and underscore the delicate balance between sovereignty and international intervention. Amidst the regional dynamics at play, the role of entities like ECOWAS looms large, holding the potential to either stabilize or further destabilize the region. The actions and decisions of regional organizations in response to the crisis carry profound implications for the collective security and stability of neighboring nations. Conversely, if its actions or decisions are perceived as heavy-handed or military intervention leads to extended conflict or unrest, it could exacerbate regional instability, creating ripple effects that impact neighboring nations. The actions taken by the regional organization in response to the crisis in Niger have had far-reaching implications for collective security in West Africa. Instability in one country can have spillover effects, fueling regional conflicts, terrorism, and migration challenges.
The international community’s response to the crisis serves as a barometer of global solidarity and commitment to upholding democratic norms. From appeals for assistance from the ousted government to nuanced statements from foreign governments, the diplomatic discourse surrounding Niger reverberates on the international stage. A recent example of this is the urgent call from a seniorUN humanitarian officialfor increased support for vulnerable communities in Niger, highlighting the critical need for immediate assistance due to limited funding and access challenges that have endangered lives. This plea underscores the pressing humanitarian aspect of the crisis.
The implementation of military diplomacy in Niger has had a significant impact on the local population and the region’s stability.
Local Population:The means and mechanisms of remote warfare have proliferated to various state actors, who combine their‘light footprint‘ to saturate distant conflict zones and sovereign nations. This saturation can lead to a heavy collective military footprint, impacting the local population. Moreover, military responses to the security crisis need to include more conflict-and climate-sensitive approaches to win the hearts and minds of thepopulation.
Regional Stability:The Western-trained army’s seizure of power in , following similar cases in Mali and Burkina Faso, has won the support of large sections of the population. However, an externalmilitary interventionrisks uncontrollable, devastating, and destabilizing consequences for the country and the entire region. The international community must prioritize diplomatic solutions and support peaceful efforts to restore stability.
In addition, theU.S.has provided over $500 million in military assistance to Niger since 2012, including training and equipping the Nigerien armed forces to fight terrorism. However, this security-focused approach has contributed to instability rather than resolving the root causes of the region’s problems. The heavy military presence and use of force against militants have fueled resentment among the local population and increased militant recruitment, as over70%of Africans who joined extremist groups did so in retaliation. Furthermore, the coup in Niger in July 2023 was a significant setback for democracy and stability in the region. Thecoupleaders have resisted diplomatic overtures from the U.S. and other international actors, raising concerns about a potential military intervention . This could further destabilize the region and embolden militant groups.The coup was driven by internal political rivalries, ethnic tensions, and anti-colonial sentiments rather than solely U.S. influence. However, the influx of U.S. military aid and presence has likely exacerbated the power imbalance between the military and other parts of the government, contributing to the conditions that enabled the coup.
Comprehensive Security Strategy for Niger
In the face of Niger’s complex security challenges, a multifaceted approach is essential. This includes legal and institutional reforms that leverage frameworks like the Lomé Protocol to ensure military interventions uphold constitutional legitimacy. Strengthening regional and international institutions is crucial for preventing and responding to political crises while adhering to democratic principles and the rule of law. Investing in conflict prevention and early warning systems can mitigate political instability risks, fostering stability and the well-being of Niger’s population.
Simultaneously, regional security cooperation must be bolstered. Enhanced intelligence sharing among West African states is vital to counter regional instability and crisis proliferation. Capacity-building and training for Niger’s security forces will improve internal stability maintenance and contribute to regional strength by curbing extremism and violence. Promoting good governance and the rule of law addresses instability’s underlying causes, paving the way for a resilient society.
Lastly, countering violent extremism requires comprehensive strategies that include community engagement, deradicalization programs, and counter-narrative campaigns. Tailoring these efforts to Niger’s specific extremism drivers, with active collaboration from local communities and civil society, is imperative. Such initiatives will not only combat radicalization but also lay the foundation for a peaceful and secure future for Niger and its surrounding region. By integrating these strategies, Niger can navigate its security challenges with a robust and proactive stance.
Questions:
1. How does the situation in Niger compare to other instances of military diplomacy globally, and what can be learned from these international experiences?
2. What are the potential long-term effects of military diplomacy on the political landscape and civil-military relations in Niger?
3. If executed, to what depth will an external military intervention affect the sociopolitical system in Niger?

Argentina’s Lithium Industry: Reforms and Radical Rhetoric,"The lithium industry in Argentina has long thrived on pro-market policies and regulatory frameworks, making it the most attractive destination market for mining investments in South America. The radical wave of ultraliberalism embodied by President Javier Milei could boost this groundwork, at least say the supporters. The Necessity and Urgency Decree (DNU 70/2023)signedby Milei on December 2023 is a first sign of his radical plans to rebuild Argentina under the principle of deregulation. It also represents a broader geopoliticalrealignmenttowards the U.S.
In 2022, Argentina’s lithium industry experienced agrowth of exports of 234% compared to 2021, in line with the general increase of lithium global demand for the energy sector. The country is also set to surpass Chile as thesecond largest global lithium producer by 2027. With such a promising outlook, how will the political shift in the country impact the national lithium industry? Despite the youth of the newly elected administration, the first measures taken at the domestic level and an overview of foreign policy power relations can help in understanding such an impact.

Twenty years have passed since the progressive centre-leftist government of President Néstor Kirchner took over Argentina, making it part of the Pink Tide in the region. But the results of the last presidential elections showed a reality that couldn’t be more different. Since 2018, the victory of leftist parties and coalitions in countries including Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil, sparked intrigue about the potential of another, yet softer,Pink Tide. But the electoral results in Argentina went in the opposite direction. Ultraliberal economist Javier Milei and his coalition La Libertad Avanza overtook Peronist candidate Sergio Massa and his coalition Unión por la Patria, winning the presidential elections.
From an economic perspective, themain goalis to reduce the role of the State as a regulator within the economy, benefitting the private market its actors. This would mean measures such as the removal of existing restrictions to the free movement of capital and into the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The decree Milei signed in December sparked a fierce debate within the country. Although its future validity depends on Congress, it arguably represents a programmatic document outlining theessence of Milei’s reforms. Thus producing consequences for the country’s leading sectors, such as the lithium industry.
Towards the Heyday of Argentina’s White Gold
With electrification increasing in the mobility sector and the uptake of renewable energies, raw materials have become increasingly critical to fuel the energy transition process. Among these, lithium has experienced an extraordinary growth, as it is an essential component of batteries for EVs and energy storage. This has resulted in a global race to gain ground in its supply chains and market, in which only few large corporations hold the reins. As such, Argentina has considerablygrown its lithium capacity, ranking fourth among the largest lithium producers and third among the largest refining countries. At the regional level, it is the second largest lithium producer behind Chile.
Within the so-called “Lithium triangle”, Argentina is believed to have the most promising growth prospects compared to neighbouring Chile and Bolivia. Various factors explain itscompetitive advantage. First, it never declared lithium as a strategic national resource, which has avoided imposing restrictions on the foreign mining companies operating in the national territory to extract the mineral. Second, since the 1990s, federal governments supported the industry with incentives and regulatory frameworks that favoured and attracted corporations. Despite an 8% tax on mining exports, corporations benefit from locked tax rates in the long run and an overall limited tax imposition, which enables them to keep around two thirds of the profits gained.
Mineral resources in Argentina are owned byProvincial governmentswhenever found under their jurisdiction. Federal law dictate the pillars and principles of the normative framework around mineral reserves’ exploration and exploitation. While the responsibility to implement the administrative procedures for concessions and environmental requirements lays on Provinces. Once corporations obtain a concession, they have no obligation to process the lithium extracted before exporting it, which explains the larger exploitation capacity compared to the country’s processing capacity. In 2022, themost relevant export marketsfor Argentina’s lithium were China (41.5%), Japan (30.7%), South Korea (12.8%) and the U.S. (9%).
The widespread deregulation planned under Milei’s administration may enhance themining-friendly environmentby curbing red-tape, lifting taxes on exports and potentially allowing foreign investors to acquire land in the country. Since 2011, theLey de Tierras(L. 26.737) has limited foreign acquisitions of Argentine soil of up to 15% of the total territory of the country, a province or a municipality. Although past administrations progressively downsized its original restrictive scope, Milei is considering derogating this law.
According to several civil society associations and provincial governors, Milei’s plansthreaten to sell the countryto foreign investors without generating a sustainable development for the local population, especially indigenous communities. Such a scenario might expose northern provinces such as Salta, Catamarca and Jujuy, where lithium reserves are concentrated, to an even fiercer race to obtain land parcels. This could give corporations more bargaining power with provincial authorities on concessions and potentially on environmental requirements.
Repurposing Foreign Policy: Rhetoric or Reality?
Albeit treated as a side issue during the electoral campaign, Milei’s approach to foreign policy has been to pledge ageopolitical realignmenttowards the U.S. and the liberal world. Yet, since his election, there has been a tacit shift in favour of a morepragmaticapproach. Milei’s geopolitical ambitions represent a turning point compared to the consolidation of Sino-Argentine relations in the past progressive administrations. Such ambition translates into the defence of liberal democracies, in particular the U.S. and Israel, and the promotion of free trade.
Yet,reality might be the greatest obstaclefor such plans. China is one of the top players in the Argentine mining sector, with growing investments and numerous projects underway for raw materials exploration and infrastructure development. China is also the top export country for Argentine lithium, absorbing 41.5%. What’s more, it is thelargest creditorthrough its infrastructure and energy investments and the currency swap line, helping Argentine governments ensure compliance with IMF debt payments.
Considering such dependence and its precarious socio-economic situation, a radical change of approach towards China would not be wise. Yet, this does not mean that change must be avoided. Argentina’s promising lithium outlook and the deregulation-driven political agenda suggestcompetition in the sector might heightenand attract new investors.
A market-centred approach could increase private actor power and set a pragmatic tone within foreign relations, regardless of the Milei’s radical rhetoric. AU.S. realignmentcould prove mutually strategic. Argentina’s lithium capacity is set to grow and the U.S. aim to secure supply chains of critical raw materials, decreasing Chinese import dependence. The U.S. critical raw materials strategy would, in principle, include greater attention to sustainable practices and environmental impact. This is an approach not prioritised by Chinese corporations.
Overall, the extent to which Milei’s rhetoric and radical electoral campaign promises will survive reality remains unknown. His minor representation in Congress and tensions with Provincial authorities’ mining interests could hinder the administration’s programme. Moreover, the persistent economic and financial instability in the country will likely give the largest reality check to Milei’s radical ambitions.

"EU Externalization in a Modern Context, an analysis","As 2023 came to a close, Italy and Albania announced a new bi-lateralagreementconcerning people rescued at sea by Italian authorities outside of both Italian and broader European Union waters; with those rescued being taken to Albania for processing. While Italy was quick tonotethat said deal would not be applied to vulnerable groups – such as children and pregnant women – human rights organizations haveaccusedthe deal of violating international law in addition to raising a variety of questions on matters such as implementation and human rights protections. However, this is not the first deal of this nature reached by an EU member state and non-member state concerning theexternalizationof responsibility for those seeking to reach the EU.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)definesexternalization as the process by which asylum seekers are forcibly transferred to third-party states whose human rights safeguards and resources are usually not sufficiently adequate to ensure the rights of asylum seekers. Furthermore, the UNHCRnotesthat the transferring state must still guarantee the rights of the asylum seekers being transferred under international law. However, these obligations are often not met during the externalization process.
Amnesty International adds to this understanding of externalization byhighlightingthe many ways in which it can be articulated. For example, seeking to shift the responsibility of the rights of both asylum seekers and migrants entirely to a third-party state, the enlistment of so-called transit countries to restrict border crossings, push-back operations that endeavor to push back people seeking to cross a border, as well as cooperation and capacity-building agreements for border control infrastructure and activities in third-party states among other articulations – with this often being predicated upon aid for said third-party states.
Just as with the aforementioned deal between Italy and Albania, the above-listed methods of externalization all pose a myriad of legal questions and issues. To be clear, what’s at stakehereare the rights of any asylum seeker or migrant deemed irregular by such policies. Hence, human rights experts are concerned about the EU’s modern externalization policies.
In a modern context, one of the most notable EU externalization arrangements was reached between the EU and Türkiye in 2016. Under thisagreement, both the EU and Türkiye have worked together to turn back any irregular arrivals to Greece – including asylum seekers – to Türkiye. Thus, committing to prevent any irregular border crossing from its territory to the EU; with Türkiyehostingsome 4 million refugees as of October 2023, with the vast majority – 3.6 million – being Syrian refugees who fled the Syrian Civil War more than 12 years ago now. In an effort tosupportTürkiye vis-à-vis the housing of refugees, the EU has provided around €10 billion to Türkiye since 2011 – with €5 billion having been provided since the deal in 2016 — and an additional €3 billion allocated for the prior year of 2023. Amnesty International hascriticizedthis externalization agreement as it has resulted in thousands of men, women, and children being subjected to inhumane conditions in overcrowded camps they are unable to leave. In addition, Türkiye has even returned people to Syria – highly likely a violation of the principle ofnon-refoulment. Türkiye is not the only country that the EU has worked out such an arrangement with, though.
Likewise, the EU has sought to establish externalization agreements with various states in North Africa. Tunisia stands as one suchexample. In this case, The EU signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Tunisia this past year to restrict migrants’ efforts to reach the EU. In return, the EU has pledged €105 million to Tunisia for so-called border management — with nearly €1 billion in additional support amid Tunisia’s economic crisis. Human rights organizations have, much as with the Italy-Albania and Türkiye deals,lambastedwhat they see as an attack on human rights. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has noted that the Tunisian coast guard has committed abuses during and after interceptions of people seeking to leave Tunisia for the EU, such as acts of violence and theft; furthermore, HRW draws attention to the fact that Black Africans have suffered from increased violence, arbitrary detentions, and forced expulsions to border zones with Libya and Algeria.
Tunisia is not the only state in North Africa with which the EU has come to an agreement on such matters. This past March, the EU and Egypt reached a €7.4 billion deal aimed at — among other matters — assisting Egypt with migration-related programs, contending with irregular migration, combating smuggling and human trafficking, strengthening border management, and ensuring sustainable return and retention. The deal — and others like it that have expanded the EU’s externalized process — has beencriticizedby both human rights organizations and EU politicians for a lack of human rights safeguards, exposing people to brutal conditions in camps, as well as financially backing undemocratic regimes. Amnesty International hasnotedthat refugees and migrants are consistently arrested for entering the country illegally, that they are detained in inhumane conditions or unlawfully deported with little in the way of proper protection, with further issues relating to Egypt’s human rights record also being raised.
While there are undoubtedly other states that could be spoken of, such asLibyaandMorocco, the picture that appears to have beenpaintedby human rights organizations would still be rendered in the same fashion; the EU has implemented and expanded an externalization process with states that have a questionable human rights record in an effort to reduce irregular migration – including that of asylum seekers– in return for funding. Incidentally enough, this characterization is not too terribly far off from that of the EU’s own description of its externalization policies.
The EU describes its“extraterritorial processing of asylum claims”as having brought a much-needed external dimension to its approach to migration management. Furthermore, President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, affirmed in a letter to the EU Commission in October 2023 that external aspects of irregular migration control were critical in implementing EU migration policy – most notably via establishing comprehensive partnerships with non-EU member states. This emphasis is drawn to what the EU would describe as its extraterritorial – externalization – policy, as the region prepares a major overhaul of its approach to refugees and immigration with a new EU pact on the matter.
On April 10th, the EU will vote on its new Pact on Migration and Asylum. Amnesty International warns that the ensuing changes will put people at increased risk for human rights violations, noting that the pact will weaken existing protections, make it more difficult to access asylum for people moving, expand detention at the border, and shift responsibility even further to third party states outside of Europe. Meanwhile, HRW indicates that the legislation provides provisions for EU members to abstain from certain human rights obligations under specific circumstances, claiming that these rules would move the EU closer to legalizing the denial of the right to asylum. However, the EU hasstatedthat the new pact will bring about a fairer, more efficient, and sustainable asylum and migration framework for the union, further claiming that the pact is designed to modernize these processes for the long term, rooted in the principles of human rights.
The EU has placed increasing emphasis on externalization in a modern context. Whether that be through the bi-lateral agreements that member states have reached with non-member states, such as Italy and Albania, EU-wide agreements that have been reached with specific non-member states, or the imminent vote on the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, it is clear that the EU is transfixed with the externalization policy. This process has routinely been denounced by various human rights organizations, who see them not only as a way to shift responsibility away from the EU but as inherently rife with major human rights abuses as well.
Policies such as these are gaining traction in the EU, with the conservative European People’s Party (EPP) vowing to take an even stricter stance on immigration in the future, angling to bolster Frontex – the EU’s border security agency – in addition to indicating an interest in seeking to replicate the UK government’s as of yet implemented Rwanda deal to externalize asylum claimants to processing in so-called safe third-party states – despite the myriad of legal challenges that has faced. With EU parliamentary elections slated for this June and the EPPprojectedto take the lion’s share of the vote in part due to these aforementioned proposals, it’s clear that the EU’s focus on this matter won’t be going anywhere.

Lebanon: When everything went South,"More than 90,000 people had to run away from the daily Israeli shooting and bombing in the South of the country according to new figures that the International Organization for Migration published in areporton May 2nd.
According to some diplomatic sources, tensions along the Lebanese-Israeli border have increased significantly, and the expansion of the war now appears inevitable, particularly following the recentIsraeli attack on the Iranian consulatein Damascus, which resulted in the loss of seven officers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
The Lebanese territory is gradually transforming into a war zone. South Lebanon is the most affected on a daily basis, but Israel also strikes other regions of the country.
The economic impact
The agricultural sector in South Lebanon, which represents 80% of the national GDP generated in this region, suffered significant losses. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlights that the fighting started during a key harvest season. The numerous exchanges of fire in South Lebanon also contributed to the increase of air pollution and to the deterioration of water and soil quality, which could cause long-term environmental repercussions. White phosphorus munitions, which international humanitarian law restricts, exacerbate these ecological concerns. Additionally, nearly 50,000 olive trees were reportedly burned by Israeli phosphorus bombs. Was there any follow-up or sanction? No. Will there be any? Doubtful.
Over the past six months, several international laws and humanitarian rules have been broken, and it is difficult to predict when or if justice will be served. South Africa accuses Israel ofviolating the Genocide Convention, and on March 28 the International Court of Justice issued a new ruling regarding the possibility that “famine will set in” in Gaza. In addition, Israel disregarded a resolution passed by the UN Security Council on March 25 demanding an immediate ceasefire for Ramadan, on which the US abstained. Even former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president in November, reaffirmed the need for an early conclusion to the conflict, saying that Israel is “totally losing the communications.”
Why is Israel determined to destroy South Lebanon?
There are three main reasons why Israel seeks destruction of the region. Firstly, to secure its northern border by keeping Hezbollah away and thus, making the area uninhabitable. Second, Israel has been occupying the rich territory of Shebaa Farms in the south since 2000. They have been holding on to this piece of land since then, taking advantage of the Lebanese resources to this day. Lastly, the Israeli strikes could also herald a potential ground invasion soon. It is important to remember that the 2006 war also began with the invasion of the South.
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant already set the tone. “We will intensify operations and expand the battlefield,” he threatened. “This is what I told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Special Envoy Amos Hochstein in Washington. And that’s what the Army has been tasked to do at Northern Command.” On the 5thof April, Hassan Nasrallah responded to Netanyahu by calling him a madman and questioning, “You can’t handle Gaza, yet you want to start a war with Lebanon?”
Reports indicate that theUnited Statesis dealing with Hezbollah realistically while putting pressure on the Israelis to prevent the conflict from escalating. For the Joe Biden administration, the solution in Lebanon lies in the gradual reintegration of Hezbollah into the Lebanese state, a process which, however, promises to be long. On the other hand, Israel expresses its dissatisfaction with the channels opened between Washington and Tehran, rejecting the “long-term” approach. This is why the Israelis are intensifying their action against Hezbollah in an attempt to push their agenda in the region and impose their terms.
The huge amount of corruption in Lebanon led to its collapse. Israel should withdraw from all Lebanese territories and implement international agreements. Syrians and Palestinians should be allowed to return to their countries. Lebanese-displaced southerners should be able to return to their regions to finally rebuild Lebanon based on the unity of national institutions and transparency.
What Christians and Muslims in South Lebanon think
How can we avoid an expansion of the conflict when there is a deep disagreement within the Lebanese population itself?In 2006, Hezbollah and southern Christians agreed not to fire from the latter’s territories. At the time, the agreement worked well and Christian villages were shelters for Shiites. Today, and since the start of the war in Gaza, the deal has been broken numerous times, creating tensions between Hezbollah/the Shiite community and the Christian community. Nonetheless, Hezbollah claims to invest in the development and reconstruction of South Lebanon as soon as calm returns, with a large sum coming from Iran. Will this be enough to give people relief? To close their wounds? And what about the sovereignty of the country?
As one looks around the city, thoughts rise amidst the passing clouds. From the country to the sea and the bustling crowd, there’s a sense of pondering life’s dualities. Taking in the sights and sounds of Beirut’s coastline, there’s a brief escape, only to be jolted back to the harsh realities: more kids begging, banks closing, and ongoing strikes in universities. These issues aren’t new; they’ve been brewing since before the October 7 War, highlighting Lebanon’s troubled past. It’s hard not to wonder how much longer the Lebanese people can keep going in the face of these challenges. The ongoing economic, political, and social crises are taking a toll, and Lebanon is hurting. The South is bleeding.

Leadership in the Global South: President Lula’s and Gaza,"In February of 2024,President Luís Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazilwas invited as a special guest to the 37th Summit of the African Union which provided an opprtunity to promotebilateral relations between Brazil and other countries in the Global South. The event particularly singled out Brazil’s relationship with Ethiopia, affirming the desire to increase the trade volume between the two nations. As demonstrated during his second presidency, President Lula’s dedication to fostering partnerships in Africa is more than empty rhetoric, withBrazil’s endorsement of the membership of two African countries, Ethiopia and Egypt, to the BRICS trading bloc underscores this commitment.
But what grabbed headlines during Lula’s visit were his comments on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. Whilst Brazil has strived to maintain a sense of neutrality in such contentious international issues, the two most recent presidents have done little to hide their proclivities. Former president Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters waved Israeli flags during his rallies, and he was very outspoken in his support for the country. During his presidency,talk came upof moving the Brazilian embassy from the capital Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to bolster the legitimacy of Israel’s claim to the holy city.
Whereas president Lula favours a more diplomatic approach and supports a two-state solution. But Lula is careful to not outright condemn Israel or distance Brazil from Palestine and its Middle Eastern allies such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Fallout from President Lula’s Remarks
In Addis Ababa,President Lula informed reportersthat the situation unfolding in the Gaza Strip was agenociderather than a war. The fallout from the statement was immediate. His words echoed the sentiments of the 54 African Heads of State, with Moussa Faki, the chair of the African Union Commission, havingdescribedIsrael’s offensive as the most blatant violation of international humanitarian law and accused Israel of having eliminated Gaza’s inhabitants.
In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahucondemnedPresident Lula’s statement, stating that it had “crossed a red line,” and accused him of being a “virulent anti-Semite.” Brazil’s Ambassador in Israel, Frederico Meyer, was subsequentlysummonedto a meeting in the Yad Vashem Museum, where he was reprimanded, before being summoned back to Brazil by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, known as Itamaraty.
Thewarbroke out on October 7th 2023, when militant group Hamas launched an attack on Israeli cities on the Simchat Torah holiday. Israel officially reported that over 1,200 people died in the attack, including around 300 soldiers. On October 9th, Israel declared a complete siege on the Gaza Strip, with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying “no electricity, no food, no fuel”would be allowed to enter. Since then, an all-out conflict has unfolded, marked by airstrikes, ground invasions, and evacuations, with no sign of peace talks on the horizon. According to the Gaza Health Ministry,the death tollhas surpassed 30,000, with 75,000 people injured since the outbreak of war. Both sides have exchanged accusations, each claiming lawful rights to the land with no swift resolution in sight.
Lula’s statement resonated with the Global South but not with other regions. Netanyahu declared that the President waspersona non gratauntil he retracted his comparison of Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip to the mass extermination of Jews by the Third Reich. In a Februarymeetingwith President Lula in Brasilia, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated he “disagreed” with his remarks on the ongoing Gaza conflict.
Internally, President Lula also faced pushback asmajor Jewish organizationsin Brazil condemned his likening of the Gaza Conflict to the Holocaust. The Brazilian Israelite Confederation (CONIB) denounced what it termed “a perverse distortion of reality” by Lula. While FISESP, the Jewish Federation of Sao Paulo—Brazil’s largest Jewish community— also criticised Lula’s statements. This was followed by a dip in Lula’sapproval ratingsfrom 54% in February to 51% in December, its lowest level since April 2023.
Additionally, Lula’s support among evangelical Christians, comprising nearly one-third of Brazil’s population, declined to 35% from 41%, while their disapproval of his government rose to 62% from 56%. But President Lula garnered backing from hisSouth American counterparts, Colombia and Bolivia, nations that also uphold left-leaning governance. Gustavo Petro and Luis Arce, presidents of Colombia and Bolivia, conveyed solidarity with President Lula.
In response, President Lula has stood firm on his statements andrejected any retraction. In an interview with BrazilianRedeTV, he maintained that he did not use the word “holocaust” in reference to Israel. Lula reiterated his stance that Israel is committing genocide against Gazan civilians, expressing doubt that Netanyahu would comprehend his initial statement.
Positioning himself as a leader of the Global South, President Lula’s remarks on the Gaza conflict were a shrewd political manoeuvre, likely to galvanise southern hemisphere nations against colonisation and human rights violations. However, domestically and with Western allies, this stance could tarnish the President’s legacy and jeopardise Brazil’s longstanding tradition of neutrality.
Looking towards the Future
In conclusion, the complex dynamics surrounding President Lula’s statements on the Gaza conflict underscore the intricate interplay between domestic politics, international relations, and ethical considerations. While his alignment with the Global South may bolster solidarity against oppression and injustice, it also risks straining relations with allies and undermining Brazil’s traditional stance of neutrality.
The implications of such statements extend beyond mere rhetoric, impacting diplomatic ties, national identity, and the pursuit of peace in the global arena. As the world continues to grapple with the complexities of conflict and diplomacy, the legacy of leaders like President Lula serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between principle and pragmatism on the international stage.
Questions
-How will President Lula’s statements on the Gaza conflict impact Brazil-Israel relations moving forward?
-Is President Lula trading domestic approval for international approval in a bid to place Brazil as a leader of the Global South?
-What role will the Global South play in the search for a solution to the Gaza conflict?

Is Ecuador Experiencing the Birth of a New ‘Plan Colombia’ Amidst Heightened Security Concerns?,"In January, Ecuador experienced an unprecedented wave of violence, starting with an incident on January 7th at La Regional prison in Guayaquil. Adolfo Macías Villamar, leader of the criminal group “Los Choneros,” was meant to be transferred to a safer prison within the complex but had already escaped. His escape sparked riots inmultiple prisons, resulting in the deaths of several guards. The situation escalated further on January 9th when armed men attacked a television studio in Guayaquil during a live broadcast, using dynamite and firearms to terrorize staff and viewers.
These events highlighted the growing violence and determination of criminal groups in the country. Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa responded by declaring a state of emergency on the same day and instituting martial law throughout the country due to the presence of an internal armed conflict. He ordered the mobilization of the Armed Forces and the National Police to counter the actions of numerous criminal gangs. According to Article 3 of thegovernment decree, the Armed Forces and the National Police will be mobilized to ensure the sovereignty and integrity of the territory against transnational organized crime, terrorist organizations, and non-state belligerent actors. The decree mentions over 20 such criminal and armed groups.
Regional and international reactions were swift, with the United States condemning the attacks and offering assistance to the Ecuadorian government. In particular, the U.S. government sent adelegation to Quitojust days after the events, including high-ranking U.S. officials such as President Biden’s special advisor for the Americas, Christopher Dodd, and General Laura Richardson, commander of the United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). During the institutional visit, Ecuador waspromiseda significant military aid package worth approximately $93.4 million, along with other forms of support for internal security. These measures may resemble some of those adopted in Colombia as part of the “Plan Colombia,” a U.S. security assistance program that spent nearly $10 billion between 2000 and 2015. However, key differences between Ecuador and Colombia suggest that a direct approach like Plan Colombia may not be suitable or effective in addressing Ecuador’s specific challenges.
The Cooperation’s Nitty-Gritty: Delving into the Details
As elucidated, in the wake of the tumultuous events that shook the Andean nation to its core, the United Statesresponded with alacrity, marshaling a considerable array of resources and initiatives aimed at fortifying security measures and combatting the scourge of drug trafficking. This concerted effort manifested in the dispatch of a substantial quantity of over 20,000 bulletproof vests, alongside a diverse range of essential emergency management equipment, which included logistical vehicles and ambulances. Furthermore, the United States articulated its steadfast commitment to enhancing the efficacy of Ecuador’s law enforcement apparatus by bolstering the presence of FBI personnel within the country. This augmentation is intended to provide invaluable support to the National Police and the Attorney General’s Office in their tireless efforts to uphold the rule of law and combat criminal activities.
Moreover, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled ambitious plans to deploy a cadre of skilled personnel to Ecuador, envisaging their role in furnishing additional support in critical domains such as digital forensic analysis. Such specialized capabilities are deemed indispensable in the ongoing struggle to dismantle criminal networks, curtail drug trafficking operations, and root out systemic corruption. These multifaceted initiatives, woven into the fabric of a comprehensive $93.4 million investment package, as announced by the commander of US SOUTHCOM, underscore the depth of the United States’ commitment to fortifying Ecuador’s security infrastructure and capacitating its law enforcement agencies.
Significantly, the recent delivery of amobile police barrackand aLockheed C-130 Hercules, with a combined valuation of more than $12 million, to the Ecuadorian armed forces serves as a tangible testament to the enduring partnership and unwavering solidarity between the United States and Ecuador in confronting shared security challenges. Through such collaborative endeavors, it is hoped that the resilience of Ecuador’s security apparatus will be fortified, paving the way for a safer and more stable future for the nation and its citizens.
Distinguishing Factors from Plan Colombia in US-Ecuador Security Cooperation
The cooperation agreement between the United States and Ecuador emerges as an intricate interplay of collaboration and contrasts, representing a complex framework of geopolitical dynamics and challenges faced by both countries. While both plans, including the United States’ aid to Ecuador and Plan Colombia, aim to strengthen security and stability in the region, their implementation reveals a series of substantial divergences that mirror the complexity of local realities.
The emphasis placed on enhancing military cooperation, intelligence sharing, and training underscores the common desire to address security threats. However, it is in the details where the most significant divergences emerge. While Plan Colombia was characterized by a substantial flow of funding, perhaps reflecting the perception of politically motivated rebel groups’ threat in the Colombian context, the proposed aid for Ecuador appears more modest, signaling a different assessment of priorities and resources needed to address a complex criminal landscape. Colombia, being a cocaine-producing country, has had to confront an internal war fueled by drug trafficking and territorial disputes among rebel groups. In contrast, Ecuador primarily serves as a transit corridor for drug trafficking, facing a different but equally pressing challenge. Ecuadorian criminal gangs, although less structured than Colombian rebels, still pose a significant threat to the nation’s security and stability, emphasizing the importance of a flexible and targeted approach.
In addition to divergences in financial dimensions and the threats faced, political and institutional differences also emerge. While Ecuador has shown sensitivity to sovereignty regarding US military operations on its territory, the same sensitivity has not affected the approval and implementation of Plan Colombia. This underscores the importance of understanding the political and institutional specificities of each country in the context of bilateral cooperation.
In conclusion, while both agreements reflect a shared commitment to addressing regional security challenges, it is essential to recognize and respect contextual differences and national specificities. Only through open dialogue, thorough analysis of challenges, and mutual collaboration will it be possible to develop effective strategies to promote security and stability throughout the region.

EU Affairs: Evolutions in Civic Space from Offline to Online,"In Europe, the rising level of political polarization is manifested in the many challenges within political discourse. As a result, the importance of civic space has never been so vital. Defined by the UN, “civic space” refers to areas that allow individuals to gather and discuss political, economic, social, and cultural lives. Thesespaces are meant to be secure, so ideas shared within them cannot be censored or silenced.
In addition to being physical places, civic spaces also exist on the internet. With the evolution of cyberspace, the internet has become anextension of public participation, with citizens expressing their political positions online. The vast reach of social media and the variety of ideas and opinions it shares make censorship cases highly investigated, even more so when entire platforms suffer from this phenomenon. Restrictions on online platforms can cause a disturbance to democracy and civic spaces while increasing theprominence of misinformation. At the same time, the lack of clarity on information online affects what people discuss, and how they discuss it.
Online and offline civic spaces should allow full and fair political engagement, but freedoms of expression and association are only granted to citizens when these spaces are not being targeted by the government. Without civic space, some of the most important conversations among fellow citizens may not happen and society would become more susceptible toisolation and oppression.
There are various reasons why civic space is important. For instance, the voices of the nation are those of its citizens. By restricting citizens’ expressions, the progress ofsociety is limited, as it means that people can only communicate through their voting power. Instead, whencivic spacesthrive, citizens discuss political issues openly and engage with political discourse to understand different perspectives and solutions that benefit all. This process of understanding leads society to improvement.
In healthy civic spaces, people feel as though they are working in a collective movement while acting and thinking as individuals. Not only does participation allow people to feel as though they have a voice, but the ability to participate, even as an observer, allows more people to gain an awareness of the political events occurring within the nation itself.
Government actions that suppress andthreaten civicspace such asintimidation, protest disruption, and censorshipare sometimes invisible to the public. Other methods to repress civic freedoms include severe escalations, likedetainment and excessive force. These methods are present across the globe, and Germany is a clear example, where theLetzte Generation’sefforts to bring awareness to the climate crisis became a target of this kind of extreme repression. The group was subject to excessive force by police during a protest and some of the protesters were detained.
In Austria, restrictions on civic space have been increasing over several years. For instance, on 27 March 2023, demonstrations by environmental activists protesting fossil fuels werebanned in several areas and dispersedwhen they became too large. Another example of repression is the ban onpro-Palestinianprotests after Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.
Apart from dismantling demonstrations, there are additional efforts to impose stringent public surveillance, likeconstant recording. Although this action already infringes on the individual’s freedom to private life, the program aims toprocess biometrics through artificial intelligence(AI). Europol implemented these procedures to quicken the process of surveillance even if the use of AI for continuous surveillance endangers basic human rights.
TheAnti-Terrorism Acthas the potential to restrict the expression, movement, and association of individuals, significantly disrupting civic spaces in Austria. While the action aims to limit crime, it burdens people with an overwhelming amount of surveillance without effectively achieving terrorist crime prevention. Only petty crimes were partially deterred. The original purposes of the act are failing, as its intention to prevent terrorism is not coming to fruition. The widespread collection of data aimed at national surveillance may also hinder people’s freedom and reinforce the feeling of being watched, which also has negative repercussions for the use of civic spaces.
Simultaneously, expensive fines are given to several organizations that speak against the actions of the Austrian government and the city of Vienna. For example, theBoycott, Divestment, Sanctions Austria(BDS Austria) group created posters that condemned the actions of Israel and linked the city of Vienna to the actions of the Israeli government. Consequently, BDS Austria was fined 17,000 Euros. Similarly, in 2023, the human rights group SOS Balkanroutespoke out against the Austrianfacilities at Lima Camp, provoking a lawsuit from the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) against SOS Balkanroute. ICMPD’s lawsuit had the potential to intimidate SOS Balkanroute using the high costs of legal fees and to silence individuals who speak out against potential human rights violations and actions of the Austrian government. These instances of legal action areStrategic Lawsuit against Public Participation, or SLAPP. The highest profile SLAPP currently concerns Verein Gegen Tierfabriken (VGT) and SPAR.VGT was protesting against SPARby creating a bloodied logo to bring awareness to the conditions of the pigs that were being sold as pork products within their store. The satirization of the SPAR logo by VGT spawned a lawsuit with incredibly high legal fees, nearly silencing the organization completely.
However, the progress towards an open civic space is visible. Although the Austrian government has moved towards hampering civic spaces, there is still room for improvement. One of these measures is the online tool Decidim, which is promoted by the government and aims to assist the public in organizing democratic participation and public assembly. Public displays and political participation levels increase with the use of public management tools. At the same time, numerous legal remedies ensure that intrusion into private matters is stopped. In 2019, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that the use of spyware aimed at uncovering private encrypted texts violated the right to privacy. This shows the Austrian fulfillment of the necessary procedures to protect civic space online and offline.
The Austrian government has taken numerous actions to uphold civic spaces, while simultaneously utilizing large legal fees to intimidate opposition. For the ongoing prosperity and security of citizens’ voices, the protection of freedom of expression must be a constant focus. The challenge of cyberspace integration into public space continues to pose many questions on how to move forward. However, protecting the dignity of humans should always be at the center of governmental action. The fundamental rights of people need protection and respect to ensure the progress and constant development of society and a future where civic spaces become a tool for freedom, improvement, and cultural and political exchanges.

Inside the US TikTok Ban: Exploring the Implications of the Bill on US-China Relations,"On April 23rd, 2024, theUS Senate passed a billthat would require ByteDance, the China-based parent company of the social media platform TikTok, to either sell its stake in the platform to a non-Chinese company or face a complete ban in the United States. This move, which came after theHouse of Representatives first passed the billon March 13th, is the culmination of the years-long political battle over restrictions surrounding the platform, which first took the social media scene by storm in 2017. The bipartisan bill now heads to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has previouslyexpressed willingness to sign any legislationaimed at banning TikTok that lands on his desk.
China’s response to the proposed US ban of TikTok remains to be seen, but will be instrumental in reshaping the global social media landscape. China-US relations, which have continued to grow increasingly strained over the last few years, will further be impacted by this bill. This bill would also obstruct China’s ambitions in the global technology market anddeepen the global digital divide.
Here is everything you need to know about this bill, including its potential impacts on US society, economy, and national security, as well as its potential long-term implications on US-China relations.
Source:Financial Times
Impacts on US society, economy, and national security
The impending TikTok ban is poised to have asignificant impact on the platform’s 170 million US users, affecting various aspects of their lives. A TikTok ban would cause users to completely lose access to their accounts, rendering them unable to upload new content or consume content produced by others on the platform. The content creation economy is a$250 billion industry, with TikTokcontributing $24.2 billionto the US economy in 2023.
A TikTok ban would also affect US small businesses. According to aneconomic impact report released by TikTok, the app drove $15 billion in revenue for US small and medium businesses (SMBs) in 2023. Over half of small business owners in the US have said that TikTok allows them to reach customers they otherwise would not be able to connect to. Additionally, TikTok has increased the sales of SMBs by 88%. 45% of SMBs consider TikTok a vital component to their business’s existence.

A key debate surrounding the TikTok ban has revolved around national security concerns. While TikTok hasexplicitly statedthat it has not shared the data of its American users with the Chinese Government and does not intend to do so, US lawmakers have repeatedly expressed concerns that this may very well be the case, despiteno public evidencesupporting these claims. TikTok has argued that ByteDance “is not an agent of China or any other country,” pointing to the global investment firms that own 60% of the company.
TikTok has indicated that it willmount a legal challengeto the bill in US courts as soon as it is signed into law by President Joe Biden, arguing that it is a breach of the US Constitution’s First Amendment, which protects the right to free speech. Several Senate Democrats havepublicly opposedthe bill, citing concerns regarding freedom of speech, and have suggested measures that would tackle foreign influence in social media without targeting TikTok specifically.
This sentiment has been shared by various civil rights groups, which have argued that while TikTok may havecontroversial data practices, those of US-based social media platforms may be just as problematic. A TikTok ban would dismantle a prominent online space for free expression, thus limiting access to information, removing avenues for content creators to build communities, and potentially silence the voices of the platform’s 170 million US users.
China’s Response to the US TikTok Ban and the US-China Rivalry
China hasmade it clearthat it will not take a passive role in TikTok’s potential ban in the United States. Currently, ByteDance has untilJanuary 19, 2025to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a complete ban in the US. China would rather take political measures to prevent the sale of TikTok from occurring than helping to mitigate ByteDance’s commercial losses by supporting the sale of TikTok to a non-Chinese company.
China is likely to utiliseexport control regulationsas a pretext to prevent the sale of TikTok. Since 2020, China has implemented various laws and regulations aimed at strengthening government oversight across a range of commercial sectors, as well as tightening controls on technology exports. The most notable of these regulations has been the Export Control Law, which is applicable to technologies such as TikTok’s algorithm. The law may be viewed as China’s shift towards technological protectionism in the face of increasing tensions with the US.
China has repeatedly warned the US that a ban on TikTok would “come back to bite” them, arguing that the US is engaging in “bullying behaviour” that seeks to subvert the principle of fair competition, thus damaging the international economic, investment, and trade order.
A ban of TikTok in the US, which is currently the platform’s largest market, would not only deal a major blow to China’s ambitions in the global technology market, but would furtherdeepen the dividebetween the US and China in the global social media landscape and international digital economy. However, it may be argued that a US TikTok ban is “fair game,” as most US social media platforms and tech companies, such as Facebook, Twitter/X, and Google are banned in China and have been since the early 2010s. Nevertheless, the US proposal to ban TikTok represents a step towards asplit platform economybetween Chinese and Western apps, and more broadly, a split in the global technology landscape.

The hardline stance that the US Government taken towards TikTok have continued to be profoundly out of touch with the American people,nearly half of which do not supporta ban of the platform. With thedeadline for TikTok’s saleset to be due on January 19, 2025, one day before Joe Biden’s term expires, a complete ban of TikTok in the US is nearly inevitable. However,Tiktok’s impending legal challengeto the bill, alongside growing frustration among the American public, may change the course of the platform’s fate in the US. Nevertheless, 2024 will prove to be a pivotal year for TikTok, and the world is watching closely as this saga continues to unfold.
Questions
1. Do you believe that China will continue to challenge the US’ proposed TikTok ban, or eventually allow a sale of the platform to go through with increased oversight on ByteDance?
2. Do you believe that the Chinese Government intends to manipulate US TikTok users’ data for political or strategic purposes?
3. How do you think that the a ban of TikTok in the US will affect US-China geopolitical relations in the long term?

(Analysis) China’s push for influence in Central Asia,"Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Central Asia has fallen largely under Russia’s sphere of influence. However, China has had its eye on the region in recent years and is increasing efforts to dominate the land mass as part of its narrative of rebuilding its historic glory as the “Middle Kingdom”.
Last year, with Russia’s attention diverted by the crisis in Ukraine, China held a summit in the ancient capital Xi’an, highly symbolic of this ancient Silk Road connection. This is only the most recent of many pushes into the region. The summit saw regional leaders discuss potential railway lines connecting China to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, and a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan. China has several initiatives in the region focused on infrastructure, regional security and connectivity, which will be discussed below.
The Belt and Road Initiative
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is aglobal infrastructure projectadopted by the Chinese government since 2013 and it is considered a centrepiece of president Xi Jinping’s foreign policy. The project includes several land and sea routes, one of which runs through Eurasia, linking China to Europe. The name of the BRI harks back to the Silk Road, which was a series of land and sea trade routes linking ancient China to Rome. The Belt and Road Initiative aims to reincarnate this old-world trading model under modern Chinese leadership. Central Asia plays a key role in this narrative, as historically, several civilisations flourished due to their strategic position along these ancient routes. Aside from trade, an important part of the historic Silk Road was the flow of ideas; Buddhism spread from India through the region and onto China, and later Islam was brought in via Persia and Arabia.
The symbolic importance of this history was demonstrated when Xi Jinping announced the project while on a state visit to Kazakhstan. Of more concrete importance for China is the strategic location, as Central Asia is a profitable way to link up its economy with Europe and offer an alternative source of revenue from the sea routes. This is advantageous as much of the oceans around China are potential flashpoints with the US and its allies, making sea trade vulnerable to geopolitics.
Central Asia also provides access to energy, and natural gas is becoming a flashpoint in the China-Russia competition for regional influence. China requires greater security for its energy needs, and it is accelerating the building of a pipeline to source gas from Turkmenistan while Russia’s push to lay a second Siberia pipeline into China is seemingly stalled by the Ukraine war.
Shanghai Cooperation Organization
When it comes to political, economic, security, and defence collaboration, in 2001 China established theShanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO), which is the world’s largest regional organisation in terms of geographic scope and population. The organisation originated from a former group called the Shanghai Five, which was China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan intending to be a political stabilisation mechanism of its West Asian borderlands. The SCO now contains most of Eurasia, and summits are held annually, with the most recent one held in India. The organisation has been dubbed“an illiberal club of growing significance” by some, as it vies to be an alternative to NATO.
The organisation was traditionally focused on reducing American influence in the region, which was a result of the conflict in Afghanistan. From there it evolved to align Chinese and Russian interests, although, with China’s increasing push into the region, the dynamic between the two powers could be now shifting. With Russia visibly weaker since its invasion of Ukraine, China may move to a more dominant position in the relationship, which would also facilitate a waning of Russian influence.
Considering the region is known for authoritarian regimes, China’s hands-off attitude towards countries’ domestic policies is likely to make it a popular candidate for regional hegemony. Indeed, Beijing’s model of a state-driven market economy under a one-party state with a weak civil society is much in line with many Central Asian regimes’ own values. One example is Tajikistan, whose presidentEmomali Rahmonhas served since 1994. He eventually overcame Islamic and democratic opposition during the Tajikistan Civil War and has ruled society with little civil liberties since. Rahmon is vocally opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, and much like China, places heavy restrictions on religion in the country.
This echoes the situation in China’s Xinjiang region, where the local ethnic Uighurs are living under close surveillance with restrictions on their social and religious liberties. Both Tajiks and Uighurs have been found fighting as part of the Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other similar groups. Hence, curbing religious extremism is of interest to both China and the Central Asian states, especially as they are concerned about extremist spillover from the recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.
China has shown interest in engagement with the Taliban, which it hopes may stabilise the country and alleviate security concerns in its backyard. If Beijing can successfully pacify the Talibs, the Central Asian states may see that in a positive light, as it is one less regional concern. Thus, in this aspect, China can appear more attractive than Russia, which tends to be more prone to direct conflict than negotiation. The recent Iran-Saudi peace deal brokered by China may serve as a potential example.
CPEC
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) describes itself as a framework of regional connectivity that has linked north and south Pakistan by highway and rail, providing inland regions easier access to ports. While CPEC is focused on Pakistan, it claims to be of benefit to the greater region of Central Asia, Iran, and Afghanistan. Projects like this ensure that Beijing is well embedded in the region and offer strong financial incentives for those states to maintain closer ties to China than Russia or other powers. Much of its existing projects are focused on infrastructure and energy, something which no developing country would turn down.
There is also talk ofbuilding a Trans-Afghan railwaysince the US exited Afghanistan. The project is cited to be an extension of CPEC and would see the Pakistan highways and railways link through to Afghanistan and eventually link up withKazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Such a project would link Central Asia with South Asia and see China playing a central role in facilitating its rollout.
Conclusion
With Russia’s economy in ruins due to the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions against it, it looks plausible that Chinese influence is only set to increase in the region, both in the near term and the long term. Central Asia is China’s best option for an alternative to the Pacific Ocean for its trade routes. China has the resources and capacity to gain influence in Central Asia while Russia is preoccupied with Ukraine. It will take Russia decades to rebuild its economy and appear an attractive partner. The apparent stalemate in Ukraine, as well as the Wagner Group’s rebellion, have only served to make Russia appear even weaker, undermining its reputation and sway.
Central Asia will be one component of China’s multi-pronged effort to diversify trade and supply lines to mitigate reliance on the maritime routes in the Indo-Pacific and Southeast Asia; an area in which China must compete directly with the US for influence and access.
While China’s infrastructure projects in the region may be attractive to leaders, Russia has one major advantage in wielding influence in the region, and that is a common language that can facilitate people-to-people connections. Russian is commonly spoken throughout Central Asia and acts as a lingua franca between states/ethnic groups. China is attempting to increase the level of Mandarin literacy in the region, with attractive scholarships encouraging youth to study in China, with initiatives such as the Confucius Institutes also found throughout the region. However, the scope is incomparable to how prolific the Russian language is.
Russia is still a popular choice for migrant workers from the region too. Many citizens of Central Asian states utilise their Russian language skills to take both skilled and unskilled jobs in Russia and send money back to their families. On the contrary, employment opportunities in China for foreign nationals are incredibly limited.
While China is making headway with governments and leaders, its people-to-people connections are still much weaker than Russia’s, and the question remains of what concrete benefits will these large infrastructure projects really bring to the people of the region.

Post – Security Law: The Dawn of Hong Kong Financial Hub?,"The global economy is gradually rebounding from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.Many major stock indicesrecorded double-digit gains throughout the year. However, amidst this recovery, Hong Kong stands out as an exception. The Hang Seng Index, a local benchmark for the city’s market performance, has experienced a significant decline of almost 50% from January 2021 to January 2024. This downturn has left the city’s financial markets stagnating. Implementation of the Security Law in 2020 and the recent passing of another – Article 23 – has reignited concerns regarding the future of Hong Kong’s financial hub status.
Hong Kong is recognized as a top-tier international financial center, renowned for its strong market infrastructure and straightforward tax system. Its legal system, rooted in common law principles, ensures the rule of law. A key factor in Hong Kong’s success has been the “one country, two systems” framework. This unique arrangement has propelled Hong Kong to become Asia’s leading financial hub, maintaining its position among the world’s top financial centers according tovarious indexes.
The implementation of the national security laws raises concerns regarding the impact on Hong Kong’s international financial status. The emphasis on national security and threat from “foreign forces” in thesecurity lawhas raised the stakes for foreign capital and businesses. While authorities argue these measures are necessary to protect the city and ensure stability, criticsexpress concernsabout the ambiguity surrounding the definition of the national security. They raise apprehensions regarding closed-door trials and the imposition of severe penalties for loosely defined offenses like insurrection and treason. Despitereassurancesfrom authorities that “normal” businesses will not be affected, local and international skeptics remain critical. Although, some question singling out Hong Kong when other countries also have national security laws in place.
The security laws have raised concerns about Hong Kong’s financial hub status. The Trump administration revoked Hong Kong’s “special status”. This does not only affect trade but also carries broader implications for Hong Kong’s international financial status. Amidst fierce competition from nearby markets. Singapore, a consistent competitor,recently beat Hong Kong as the world’s freest economy. Global banks and businesses have downsized their operations and chosen to relocate, while Singapore emerges as their preferred destination. Theofficial datashows the number of global companies’ regional headquarters in Hong Kong has decreased by 8.4% since 2019, with a significant 30% drop in staffing levels. Emerging markets in the region pose additional challenges.Indiasurpassed Hong Kong as the fourth largest stock market in January 2024.
A Shift of Financial Dynamics in the Region?
While some critics express concerns, others remain optimistic about Hong Kong’s status as the leading financial center in the region.David Liao, co-chief executive of HSBC Asia Pacific, remarked, “Hong Kong’s strength as a global financial center is best demonstrated by its role in the reform and opening up of China’s economy.”
The assessment of whether Hong Kong’s international financial hub status will endure can be approached from two perspectives. Firstly, it depends on the Chinese central government’s ongoing recognition of Hong Kong’s significance as a financial center, and whether emerging Chinese financial markets could replace Hong Kong’s role. Additionally, the perception of foreign investors regarding its utility and reliability as a financial hub carries significance.
Hong Kong functions as a vital financial center for Beijing. It fulfills China’s objectives of maintaining domestic financial stability and integrating with the global financial system without sacrificing her control on the market. Hong Kong’s unique status allows China to pursue her ambitions, while serving as a gateway for international investors to enter China.
As China’s reform policies advance, the gap between Hong Kong and mainland markets narrows. Some argue thatChina is reducing reliance on Hong Kong by promoting mainland cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen as new financial hubs.Recent developments, such as direct market agreements betweenShanghai and London and Shenzhen and London, challenge Hong Kong’s traditional role.
Despite these shifts, Hong Kong maintains significant advantages. Its connectivity and centrality to global finance support Beijing’s efforts to promote the renminbi’s international use. Unlike onshore hubs, Hong Kong offersunique market and regulatory buffers, ensuring market openings do not endanger domestic financial stability. The absence of foreign exchange controls and the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the US dollar provide financial stability. Additionally, its established infrastructure and transparent regulatory framework attract foreign investment. Beijing’s strong rhetoric about Hong Kong’s status as a leading financial hub in Asia-Pacific underscores its importance. Despite emerging mainland competitors, Hong Kong’s distinct advantages suggest it will retain significance in Beijing’s eyes.
The success of Hong Kong lies in its perception as distinct from other mainland markets and as a gateway to enter the Chinese market. However, the passage of national security laws and Beijing’s closer grip, suggests a potential transformation into just another Chinese city. Although some critics argue external perceptions of Hong Kong’s autonomy may not significantly impact its key advantages, such as its peg to the US dollar. They contend that globalization’s network effects and entrenched dynamics within the international financial system make it challenging to disrupt these advantages.
Kevin Tsui, chief economist at Orientis, asserts, “Even if Hong Kong is just a Chinese city, foreigners want to do business with China.” However, others emphasize the importance of perception.Johannes Hack,president of the German Chamber of Commerce, notes, “While the city is still distinctly different from the mainland, the focus on security may increasingly blur the distinction in people’s minds.”
Outside Perception of Hong Kong has changed
The future of Hong Kong hinges not only on whether it becomes another mainland city but also foreign investors’ willingness to invest in China. Geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing have made foreign investors increasingly wary of pouring funds into Hong Kong’s stock market. The pandemic has worsened the situation, disrupting the global economy. Meanwhile, China grapples withmounting debt and a property market crisis. As a result, investors, particularly those from the West, are becoming more hesitant to bet on Hong Kong’s financial future. Unless these challenges are addressed and investor confidence is restored, Hong Kong’s position as a top-tier financial hub remains uncertain.
Hong Kong continues to play a crucial role in China’s ambitious “Going-Out Scheme”.People’s Bank of Chinaassigns Hong Kong the pivotal leading role in the “Greater Bay Area”. These developments indicate that Hong Kong’s financial status remains significant in China’s plans. The Belt and Road Initiative opens doors for Hong Kong to draw in investors from non-traditional regions such as the Middle East, expanding beyond its reliance on Western investors. This suggests a potential shift in Hong Kong’s role and direction in the global financial landscape. As Hong Kong embraces these new responsibilities and opportunities, it may undergo a transformation in its financial market dynamics.
While it is too early to evaluate the risks of the national security laws to businesses and financial markets. Hong Kong’s financial status faces challenges ahead, with little time to spare. While Hong Kong retains its importance for China, the worries of foreign investors and the emergence of new financial hubs in the region, such as Singapore and India, pose significant threats. Hong Kong’s future as a premier financial center will depend on its ability to adapt to these shifting dynamics and maintain its competitive edge in the global financial landscape. All while addressing external concerns and uncertainties brought about by the new security laws.

The Tian-Shan Gambit: Europe’s Ambitions in Central Asia,"Central Asia is a vast and resource-rich region situated between three major centers of influence. Formerly part of both the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union, its nations have only recently gained independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. They continue to be influenced by Moscow, although they have made some significant strides towards autonomy in their own right. The Russian military’s actions in Ukraine have continuously eroded the credibility of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russian-led military alliance. This, coupled with a significant loss of soft power in the countries of the post- Soviet space, which traditionally formed part of its sphere of influence, could create an opening for other influential actors to emerge as real alternative partners. The European Union wishes to consider an even more proactive role in Central Asia, given the young nations’ of Central Asia newfound pragmatism in foreign policy and its potential to enhance EU interests. This article serves as a brief summary of EU interests in the region.
Russia has not yet been able to achieve a swift victory in Ukraine, nor has it been able to facilitate an organic resolution of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Furthermore, its approach to ethnic tensions in Central Asia has not been as effective as it could be, resulting in general ignorance of border clashes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Moscow’s significant resources and manpower investment in what many Central Asians believe is a futile cause has led to some anti-colonial sentiments in Central Asian nations. These nations aim to maintain their unique national identities against perceived regional hegemony. It is worth noting that the Kazakh president Tokayev has publicly refrained from recognizing the sovereignty of the separatist republics in Ukraine and still does not recognize Crimea as Russian. Additionally, pro-Ukrainian demonstrations have been permitted in the country to some extent. While it would be unwise for any of these governments to be overly pro-Ukrainian, given their heavy security and economic dependence on Russia, the recent public divergences from a strict pro-Russian rhetoric are indicative of a step towards amore neutral foreign and domestic policy.
In matters of regional cooperation, energy and connectivity, it seems that the EU has increased its engagement with Central Asia. European interests in Central Asia are manyfold, and it would be a mistake to view them as a one-way street. The European Union is in a position to provide an alternative path to development for the region that Russia or even China does not offer. It would be advantageous to capitalize on this while gaining significant ground in the ongoing geopolitical competition against Russia and China. At the same time, it would be prudent to ensure a positive economic partnership conducive to European energy security. As a result of Russia’s actions in Ukraine and the subsequent decline in Russian gas imports, German stakeholders and decision-makers have been faced with a number of challenges, including domestic uncertainties and elevated energy prices. Securing a reliable and cost-effective supply for German power plants has remained a top priority since then. While the more straightforward options, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States or trade agreements withsuppliers in the Middle East, were initial steps, they often involve higher costs than the gas previously supplied by theNord Streampipeline.
It would be remiss not to mention the considerable potential of the gas and mineral-rich Central Asian nations to provide a stable supply of raw ressources to the EU in the future. While currently financially and logistically challenging, the idea of the great Middle Corridor, an alternative to the northern route through southern Russia and the southern maritime route through the Suez Canal, continues to spark the interest of European strategists and geoeconomists. The Middle Corridor, also known as theTrans-Caspian International Transport Route(TITR), is similar to some of the projects of the Belt and Road Initiative in China in that it aims to create a comprehensive transportation network, including freight and passenger railways, to connect Central Asia through various ports in the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan and to Europe through Turkey. Currently, the existing infrastructure and Caspian trade fleets are only capable of carrying but a small fraction of the potential capacity, which presents an opportunity for further development. In order for the capacity to be fully utilised, significant funds and political will power will be required to implement long-term strategies that will bypass trade routes that are perceived to be susceptible to foreign intervention .
While Central Asia is renowned for its vast and barren steppes and deserts, its ground hides a vast amount of precious minerals, including gold and uranium, which are mined in Kazakhstan. Additionally, there are significant untapped reserves of natural gas and oil in both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. It is worth noting that these countries’ economies are still heavily dependent on the export of these raw resources and on sending labor to neighboring Russia. While there is a possibility of a resource curse, given the limited development since the fall of the Soviet Union, a failure to modernize infrastructure and significantly diversify its economies, it is possible that significant investment in these untapped resources could yield positive socio-economic results in Central Asia, if circumstances permit.
It is worth noting that European support is traditionally accompanied by political obligations. In this regard, the challenges to good governance in Central Asian countries have been a source of quite some concern for European policymakers, especially recently. All Central Asian countries except for The Republic of Kyrgyzstan are essentially super-presidential autocracies with tight control of civil society, media and economy, which is a result of the heavily securitized decision-making agenda. Despite this, there have been some encouraging signs of progress, including the promotion of mild reforms to enable institutional building, attempts to transition to a liberal market economy since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the enhancement of minority rights with EU support.
Additionally, European engagement in the region encompassesregional security concerns. Although the region is geographically distant from Europe, there is a growing awareness of the potential threat of transnational terrorism and a rise in religious extremism. This has been a priority on the agenda since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. It is a concern that its conflict with ISIS fighters in Khorasan could potentially become more intense and spread beyond the region. The Central Asian leaders are aware of the threat and grateful for already established European support, which they view as a method to enhance regional security and by extension the stability of their domestic regimes. In particular, the EU is interested in expanding cooperation with Central Asian nations to address common security concerns, such as religious radicalization, violent extremism, terrorism, hybrid and cyber threats, and nuclear safety. Furthermore, theEU Global Gateway Initiative, which acts as a European alternative strategy to the Belt and Road Initiative, focuses on infrastructure development across the world, including Central Asia. This initiative is positioned to enhance connectivity in the region, which is an important aspect of addressing the socioeconomic roots of radicalization. It facilitates greater mobility of people and goods and provides opportunities for growth and development. The EU acknowledges the significance of this aspect and is striving to reinforce it through these initiatives and other avenues.
In order for this to succeed, it would be beneficial for the EU to continue to engage with the region for the long term with a consistent level of economic investment and diplomatic involvement. This could help the Central Asian countries to develop economically while also enhancing their independence and civil identity, which they are now actively seeking. However, this must be done in a way that does not risk a negative response from Russia, which may perceive that Central Asian states are becoming less aligned with it and could seek to leave its sphere of influence, which is so integral to Russian foreign policy. In essence, European decision-makers must engage in a geopolitical game for Central Asia in a way that does not appear to be geopolitical. While it is quite unlikely that Central Asian nations will ever become close and staunch, values-oriented allies of the EU, this gambit may result in a pragmatic and valuable partnership while denying ground to Russian and Chinese ambitions in the region.
Questions:
Are normative obligations to foreign help conducive to success in geopolitical competition?
Is the long term investment into the Middle Corridor an economically sound plan?
Could Central Asian countries become long term European allies or will they be forced to pursue pragmatic neutrality given their geography?

(Analysis) The rise of Private Military Companies in Modern Conflict,"On June 23, 2023, the world held its breath when the Wagner coup, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, rose in rebellion against what they saw as the Russian Armed Forces’s unjustkilling of Wagnerian soldiers. However, within one day, Wagner and the Russian government ceased their hostilities and the conflict between the two parties was seemingly over; exactly two months after the rebellion, Prigozhin waskilled in a jet crashin Tver Oblast. This signaled the end of the famous Wagner mercenary group that captured many headlines throughout the Russo-Ukrainian war. Nevertheless, Wagner may serve as the herald of a new era; an era in which soldiers fight under private entities instead of the state and PMCs engage in conventional warfare.
This trend of private actors engaging in war is nothing new at all, and in fact, has archaic roots. Before the rise of the modern state, European monarchs and nobles often hired mercenaries to fight in their feuds; the oldest surviving mercenary contact can be dated back tothe 13th century
Modern mercenary or private contractors’ origin can be traced to the Cold War when ex-SAS veterans David Stirling and John Woodhouse founded WatchGuard International. Their missions were a far cry from conventional warfare and instead provided training and advisory roles. Private military organizations have continued to proliferate, especially after the end of the Cold War, due to significantcuts to military budgetsthroughout the 1990s. Initially, modern PMCs were contracted to provide support for traditional national militaries; PMCs provided logistical support and guarded key facilities, training, and reconnaissance. Gradually, the military has grown overly reliant on them. By the late 2000s, PMCs played a major role in both of the US’s missions inIraq and Afghanistan. In recent years, international corporations have also increasingly hired their services, especially to guard their resources and value facilities in unstable countries or prevent their cargo ships from being hijacked by non-state actors. However, the Wagner Group’s actions in the Russo-Ukrainian War represent a departure from the supplementary role PMCs have traditionally provided; rather than providing support to the military, they acted as a proper army and engaged the Ukrainian national army on equal terms.Judging from past developments, it is reasonable to assume that Wagner might not be the last PMC to attain such capabilities, and will likely serve as an example of what to expect in the international security landscape in the near future.
Perhaps, the resurfacing of modern PMCs can be traced back to the nature of the state in the 21st century. Old mercenary formations were met with extinction when the state managed to centralize control over its population and resources. The state preferred to use the national army which was ideologically driven to fight in its interest, as mercenaries were notoriously unreliable when profit was involved. However, the modern state of the 21st century is seemingly losing that control, due to the globalization and digitalization of society, causing the state to become weaker and society to be fragmented.  Subsequently,  the loyalty of the population does not lie with the state in which they reside, and instead with outside entities. This can be seen inthe case of American men who fought for the IDFin the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian war, or in the instance ofmultinational volunteer groupsthat fought on both sides of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Furthermore, the modern state is unable to motivate its young men to join the military as demonstrated by a poll conducted in the UK that indicatedthe young men will not fight for their own country. This case prompted a debate on the revival of conscription, a policy that may cause massive political backlash. The problem is exacerbated bydeclining fertility rates, making the prospect of fulfilling the recruiting quota in any developed country untenable. Given these challenges, the prospect of having ready-made soldiers for hire on the global market seems to be a tempting option for the state.
Additionally, the globalized economy created powerful multinational conglomerates that have independent economic interests in many parts of the world. The area associated with their interest might be threatened by undesirable actors, and the state may lack the capacity to protect the corporate interest. In this case, corporations have resorted to hiring private security firms to protect their interests. One such instance is the case of Chinese security firms protecting Chinese business alongsidethe modern Silk Roads, while another is PMCs protecting resources and valuable infrastructures ofmultinational firmsoperating in unstable states

Although controversial, PMCs offer unparalleled flexibility to hirers.PMCs provide room for deniability and avoid political backlash for contractee states when engaging in risky foreign policy ventures. Throughout the US campaign in Afghanistan, PMCs sufferedsignificant casualties, however, their death barely made it to the headlines in the news; in the same fashion, Russia denied its involvement with Wagner for many years before the Russo-Ukrainian war.  Moreover, in warfare, PMCs can provide quick supplementary soldiers to traditional armies that might lack sufficient manpower and bring technical expertise to insufficiently developed militaries.
Meanwhile,  there is a discussion of the possibility of using PMCs in peacekeeping operations. Normally, dispatching a peacekeeping force is a cumbersome process that requires consensus among the UNSC members, but the existence of PMCs provides an opportunity to tap into a wealth of experienced soldiers that can be quickly mobilized. Furthermore, PMCs can leverage their experience to support and train the traditional security and armed forces of weak states to combat non-state actors or prevent ethnic conflict in specific regions.
Though the prospect of privatizing peace is tempting, significant problems are attached to relying on such an entity. Indeed, PMCs are usually staffed with experienced personnel,however, it should be noted that these personnel are often plagued bymental illnessessuch as PTSD, depression, and excessive alcohol abuse. This coupling with the loose structure of the private military organization can cause trouble for local populations;  In 2005, a video was circulated on the internet showing the members of Aegis Defense Services shooting at Iraqi civilians. Moreover, as the PMCs are financially rewarded for the conflict, ending the conflict and stabilizing the region may go against their best interest.

The future war is already here; the Russo-Ukrainian war is revealing the general characteristics of the future war. Russia and Ukraine struggle to find enough soldiers to fight in this war. Russia only issued partial mobilization and did not bother to risk its regime’s survival with the total mobilization. Meanwhile, Ukraine struggles to find enough bodies toman the front line. Of course, both sides enjoy each respective domestic supporters and yet refuse to issue total mobilization, knowing the potential political backlash that the policy might cause. For example, the Ukrainian draft age onlybegins at 25 years old. The scale of the war in Ukraine is massive, buteven an authoritarian state like Russia which allegedly has complete control over entire national resources, finding enough material to fuel the war is still a challenge.
What we can learn from this? The world is looking at the potential escalation of the Sino-American rivalry. However, judging from the current trends of both states, whose people arefragmentedand resentful of their government, it isn’t very certain that they would remain content if their countries ever issued total mobilization. Thus, this only allows the possibility of a small-scale war due to the limited pool of available manpower from both sides.This condition is highly similar to the characteristics of warfare in the pre-industrial era. If the conflict becomes prolonged, then both belligerent powers might seek the assistance of the PMCs to fuel their manpower needs.
Overall, it has been estimated that theglobal value of private militariesis at 20k billion USD with a compound annual growth rate of 4.4 percent. Hence, the private security sector is a lucrative industry that barely shows any signs of slowing down. Private security companies will likely continue to proliferate, owing their success to the needs of both the private and public sectors. Their existence might be a subject of controversy, but they are here to stay and might be a common player in the future security landscape.

Venezuelan Elections Amidst U.S. Sanctions: Balancing Democracy and Diplomacy,"As tensions escalate between the United States and Venezuela ahead of the country’s upcoming presidential elections in July, the delicate balance between democracy and diplomacy is under scrutiny. Last year, the US government took steps to alleviate diplomatic tensions by easing sanctions against Venezuela, aiming to foster dialogue between the government and opposition parties to address pressing economic concerns.
However, recent events have re-ignited diplomatic friction, raising concerns about the fairness and transparency of the electoral process and prompting the US government to reimpose sanctions on Venezuela.
Venezuela has long been the target of a diverse array of sanctions imposed by the US government, primarily focused on restricting access to the US financial system and penalizing individuals deemed by US authorities to have violated human rights or undermined democratic processes within the Latin American nation. Thesesanctionswere initially introduced during the presidency of George W. Bush, and have persisted through subsequent administrations to the present day. Moreover, in addition to the mentioned measures, these sanctions have been extended to address issues such asdrug trafficking, visa restrictions, terrorism, and corruption.
Among the most recent sanctions levied against Venezuela by the US government, before April 2024, occurred during the Trump administration in January 2019. The Secretarydeterminedthat “Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PdVSA, warranted sanctions. This led to the freezing of all property and interests owned by PdVSA, subjecting it to US jurisdiction and prohibiting transactions with US individuals and companies”.
Additionally,sanctions were imposedon Venezuela’s Central Bank, the National Development Bank, and the state-owned gold company; Minerven. Moreover, sanctions targeted individuals and entities perceived to support the Maduro government, alongside the seizure of vessels transporting Venezuelan oil.
Despite the strained relationship between the US and Venezuelan administrations, there have been notable shifts in diplomatic approaches. Following the transition from President Trump to President Biden, the Biden administration initiated a re-orientation of diplomatic relations with the Maduro government in 2019. This involved gradually issuing amended licenses permitting certain transactions between the two nations, to facilitate negotiations for democratic elections in Venezuela.
One significant development occurred in May 2022 when discussions regarding future operations with PdVSA involving Chevron, the only American energy company in Venezuelan territory, was allowed. Subsequently, after a series of negotiations,Chevron resumed its production and commercial activities in Venezuelain November 2022. This marked a crucial step towards fostering dialogue and cooperation between the two nations.
One year later, the outcome of those negotiations materialized in the signing of theBarbados Agreementin October 2023. This agreement, endorsed by the Maduro government and representatives of the opposition firstly, aimed to promote political engagement by lifting restrictions on political participation and ensuring freedom of expression and assembly for all candidates. Secondly, it sought to uphold the integrity of the electoral process by addressing concerns about the credibility of the electoral system.
Following the signing of the Barbados Agreement, Venezuela’s Supreme Justice Tribunal recently made a divisive ruling, upholding a 15-year ban preventing presidential candidate Maria Corina Machado from holding office. Machado, who secured victory in the opposition’s independently-run presidential primary with over 90 per cent of the votes in October, now finds her candidacy for the upcoming presidential elections slated for the latter half of 2024 in jeopardy.
The tribunal’sruling, which coincides with thedetention of three of Machado’s allieson conspiracy charges, underscores the escalating tensions between President Nicolas Maduro’s government and the political opposition. Citing findings of Machado’s alleged support for US sanctions, involvement in corruption, and financial losses of Venezuela’s foreign assets, including US-based oil refiner Citgo and Colombian chemicals company Monomeros, the court maintained its stance on the ban.
The 15-year ban on Machado’s candidacy was perceived by the Biden administration as a failure to comply with the Barbados agreement,raising concernsabout electoral manipulation and the harassment of political opponents. Consequently, the administration decided not to extend the sanctions relief granted in October 2023. Instead, the US re-imposed the sanctions initially imposed by the Trump administration in 2019 following Maduro’s re-election victory, targeting Venezuela’s gold mining, oil, and gas sectors. This action was taken on April 18th 2024. The decision was prompted by Maduro’s government’s refusal to reverse Machado’s ban, and the ongoing detention of activists and the allies of the opposition in recent months.
Despite the decision, Washington emphasizes that these events shouldn’t be taken as a signal of a complete loss of faith in Venezuela’s ability to conduct fair and inclusive elections that re-affirms their ongoing commitment to dialogue with Maduro’s representatives.
The recent re-introduction of sanctions for Venezuela has stirred apprehensions about its economic stability and humanitarian well-being, echoing past instances of punitive measures. As these sanctions take effect, Venezuela anticipates a substantial impact on its fuel sales, while US oil firms operating in the country navigate the complexities of obtaining special permissions. In the event US administration does not provide sufficient individual authorizations, Venezuela’s state-owned oil entity, PDVSA, may resort to unconventional channels to market its oil at reduced rates, primarily directing its efforts towards the Asian market.
Additionally,Venezuela’s recent decisionto halt deportation flights from the United States and Mexico has thrust the Biden administration’s management of the ongoing migrant influx into the spotlight once again. This sudden policy shift, implemented in January 2024, highlights the intricate challenges surrounding enforcement strategies amidst diplomatic strains and geopolitical tensions. Venezuela’s decision to annul an agreement forged last October, amidst the backdrop of looming US threats of economic sanctions, which have now materialized into a reality, alongside escalating geopolitical discord, further complicates the already strained relations between the two nations.
Venezuela’s mass migration crisis, stemming from its economic collapse and humanitarian struggles, looms large as a critical challenge to regional stability in Latin America. Whileneighboring nations extend aid to immigrants,the sheer influx strains public services and labor markets, posing a threat to the region’s delicate equilibrium. Amidst Venezuela’s dire circumstances, millions seek refuge in countries like Colombia, Peru and Brazil. Underscoring the urgent call for regional collaboration to tackle this pressing issue and uphold stability across Latin America.
As the migration crisis persists, the Biden administration finds itself under increasing pressure to navigate these complex dynamics while crafting comprehensive strategies that balance enforcement priorities with humanitarian concerns. Enhanced cooperation with regional partners becomes paramount to prevent further exacerbation of the crisis and effectively address the challenges at hand.
As the date for Venezuela’s presidential elections draws near, questions loom large over the future trajectory of US-Venezuela relations amidst recent diplomatic upheavals. Against the backdrop of escalating tensions, the delicate interplay between democracy and diplomacy takes center stage, with implications reverberating far beyond national borders.
The upcoming elections slated for July 2024, unfold against a backdrop of renewed diplomatic friction between the United States and Venezuela. Despite initial attempts to thaw relations by easing sanctions and fostering dialogue, recent events have reignited tensions, prompting the re-imposition of sanctions by the US government. With concerns mounting over the fairness and transparency of the electoral process, the delicate balance between democracy and diplomacy hangs in the balance.
As the diplomatic saga unfolds, the implications of these developments extend beyond bilateral relations to impact regional stability and global geopolitics. Venezuela’s alliances with global powers like Russia and China come under scrutiny, as they navigate the complex web of international relations within US sanctions. Against this backdrop, the need for a coordinated and multilateral approach to address the challenges posed by Venezuela’s presidential elections becomes increasingly urgent.

The European Defence Industrial Strategy: a new step within the European Union’s Security and Defence roadmap,"The European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and the European Defence Industry Programme presentation by the European Commission and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Source:European Commission.
Defence has become a key issue for the European Union Member States. After Russia invaded Ukraine, old needs have resurged in thegeopolitical chessboard. European citizens manifested their support for a stronger defence in the latest Eurobarometer (Spring 2023).  77% of the respondents consider that Member States should coordinate better their purchase of military equipment, 69% would like the EU to reinforce its capacity to produce military equipment, and 66% declare that the EU should make more investments in defence.
In the meantime, the European Union’s leaders are divided on how to deal with military support for Ukraine. While the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, voiced support for sending soldiers to Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz,rejected this approachand reaffirmed his position of only providing military equipment to Ukraine. War rhetoric has taken hold in many European politicians. In this context, the issue arose in the European Union institutions, leading to the adoption of the firstEuropean Defence Industrial Strategy(EDIS)at the beginning of March 2024. This sets the vision for the European defence industrial policy until 2035.
The EDIS  is structured on theEU Defence readiness conceptdefined as a steady state of preparedness of the Union and its Member States to protect its citizens’ security, the territory integrity and critical assets or infrastructures, and its core democratic values and processes. The provision of military assistance to its allies is included in this new conception. This EDIS proposes ambitious measures to encourage and support the transformation of the European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB). These include arranged and more cooperative planning of investments, support for joint procurement, encouraging more effective incorporation of innovation, greater continuity in efforts to develop high-end capabilities and strategic enablers, and other ambitious measures.
The investment is important to achieve EU Defence readiness. The mantra underlying the strategy is to leverage the defence investmentmore, better, together,andEuropean.

Regarding the axis “investing together“, the EDIS proposes thejoint procurement of at least 40% of defence equipmentby 2030 to show a sustained and long-term EDTIB demand. However, Member States have still not met the target they agreed on in the 2007 EDA Ministerial Steering Board to allocate 35% of their total budget to the acquisition of equipment in European collaboration. Furthermore, the Commission will design a new legal framework, theStructure for European Armament Programme (SEAP). Member States will benefit from standardised procedures for initiating and managing cooperative defence programmes. Governments will benefit from VAT exemptions when the Member States agree on joint procurements. Moreover, this new approach wants to ensure thatby 2030, the value of intra-EU defence trade represents at least 35% of the value of the EU defence market.
Related to the“investing European”axis, before the war, approximately 60% of Member States’ defence investments were made with non-EU suppliers. From 2022 the percentage will rise to 80%, possibly for reasons of urgency.  For this reason, member states are encouraged to make constant progress towards procuring at least 50% of their defence investments within the EU by 2030 and 60% by 2035.
Collaboration with the EU’s strategic partnersis another cornerstone of EDIS, especially NATO. The EU encouraged both organisations to continue to exchange views and explore synergies and complementarity of efforts in the realm of supply chain security essential to capability development and delivery. This statement of intent has to be read froma strategic autonomyperspective, there are a lot of European voices defending for shaking off the military dependence of the United States and NATO.
In order to implement these proposals, this draft includes a budget ofEUR 1.5 billion for investment. It could be increased with the windfall profits of frozen Russian assets. However, this way isunder examinationbecause it will have legal and international implications due potential forcefulopposition of Russia. Moreover, the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period from 2028 onwards should include strongest budgets for defence.
Closer ties with NATO and strategic partners and closer cooperation with Ukraine are also part of EDIS. Source:European Commission.
The EU intends to transform the EU defence industry because it is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the military forces and preserve peace. According to the EDIS, the European defence industry is a crucial contributor to resilience, security, and social sustainability. The state-of-the-art technology and the ability to ensure the steady availability of any defence equipment are necessary for the EU’s new approach. AsJosep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,  stated: “In the current geopolitical context, we have no other choice: we need to become “defence ready”. I am confident that our Member States will show the political will and provide the necessary resources to make the bold leap forward that is needed to take control of our own destiny”.
This EDIS is not just another EU tool that regulates the common market, because of its subject matter and the multiple implications it has, it is a long-term geopolitical asset. It is a message of autonomy and self-assertion in today’s world. The EU is ready for new global threats and maintains its own forceful speech.","June 12, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/european-defence-industrial-strategy/,María Vallés González,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Italy Fights EU On Nutri-Score System,"For anyone even slightly familiar with Italy, the nation is very protective of its cuisine. This, however, is for good reason. Italian food is consistently considered one of the best worldwide and restaurants serving pasta and pizza are available all over. Italy’s first female prime minister, Giorgia Meloni is concerned that the European Union’s nutritional rating system is flawed and potentially even biased towards an Italian diet. TheNutri-score systemas it currently stands would rank foods with a grade from A to E and would require olive oil to write a D on the front of the label. For anyone familiar with the benefits of olive oil, this can be perplexing. The D rating likely comes from the fact that olive oil is highly caloric with 100 grams of the ingredient containing over 800 calories, yet Italian cuisine only requires a small amount. While 100 grams of other foods such as vegetables, fruit, grain, and meat may be consumed in one sitting, it is unfair to compare olive oil in this manner when it is not meant to be consumed this way. As it stands, citizens who carefully watch nutrition labels may be scared away by the label, causing more harm than good.
In order to block the rating system, there have been moves toamendthe constitution. Italy has also worked to find allies in the European Union to oppose the nutrition rating system. It has yet to be seen if these efforts will work, yet it is a worthy fight. The system appears to focus more on low-calorie, low-fat foods as ‘healthy’ while calorie dense and fat rich foods are ‘bad’, despite that people need some fat in their diet and not all fats are equal, such as those in olive oil.
Italy may have good reasons too to refute a nutritional rating system that overlooks the benefits of some foods. Italy has consistently had a longer life expectancy than not only wealthier member states in the European Union, but one of the highest life expectancies worldwide. In2023, life expectancy in Italy is83,8 years, only behind Spain (84 years). Both nations are significantly higher than the EU average of81,5 years.This is why it is unjust for critics of Meloni to try to dismiss her concerns as far-right nationalism when she has a point. Research regardingolive oildemonstrates it can be beneficial with fighting inflammation which has a role in type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and heart disease. While the intended aim of the new rating system is to simplify nutritional information, the benefits of products consumed in moderation such as extra virgin olive oil are overlooked. Besides olive oil, traditional cheese such as gorgonzola and parmiggiano reggiano will receive low ratings. Traditional Italian cooking does not encourage overconsumption of these products in the first place.
While Italy is sounding the alarm bell on how systems meant to give nutritional guidance to citizens are flawed, it is not the first to do so. Another recent example is a study by Dr. Dariush Moaffarian, a cardiologist and the dean of the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science. The study has been heavily criticized on social media after it was realized that the study was funded in part by the Bill Gates and Melinda Gates Foundation and appears to align with his past statements about eating less meat. While nutritionists typically recommend a well rounded diet and do not recommend the overconsumption of meat, this study gives a higher grade topeanut butter m&msthan it does to pork and beef sausage, and General Mills cocoa puffs are ranked higher than grilled chicken. This seems perplexing as just one serving ofGeneral Mills cocoa puffscontain13 grams of sugar, equivalent to slightly over half of what a woman should consume daily and 36 percent for a man according to theAmerican Heart Association. It also contains only2 gramsof protein, compared to26 gramsin a 3-ounce serving of grilled chicken breast.
While people should be encouraged to maintain a healthy diet that includes a variety of foods and not just meat, it is extremely concerning that research is essentially advising people that sugary cereal and peanut butter m&ms aresignificantlyhealthier than meat. As Meat however typically contains more protein per 100 grams than other foods such as cocoa puffs, peanut butter m&ms and fruits and vegetables, including moderate amounts can be beneficial to people in order to increase satiety and prevent themselves from overeating.
While the intent of this rating system is positive, it can have negative consequences on Europeans suffering from eating disorders. People who suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia will often take it upon themselves tocategorizedifferent foods as good or bad. Now the new food labels will reinforce this, potentially making it harder for those suffering from eating disorders to establish a healthy relationship with food. Instead of pushing the message that some foods should be consumed in smaller portions, those suffering from eating disorders may struggle to push themselves to purchase foods not rated as ‘A’ or ‘B’. Giving Extra Virgin Olive oil only a letter grade higher than sugary beverages can be harmful to citizens, ED or not. While sugary beverages essentially have NO health benefits and besides enjoyment have no reason to be consumed, olive oil can be beneficial in multiple ways in moderate consumption.
While it is commendable that the European Union wants to help provide nutritional guidance to citizens, focusing on labeling individual products as good or bad may do more harm than good. Some foods should be consumed in moderation more than others, yet this does not mean that they should be avoided entirely. Simply labeling foods A through E erases this nuance and fails to teach moderation to EU citizens. People should not completely avoid olive oil, simply use it in moderation. Opponents of Meloni should not be quick to dismiss her concerns as far-right nationalism but instead examine why a rating system of food is being proposed in the first place instead of in-depth lessons on nutrition in schools. While it can be beneficial to try to simply subjects for people to better understand them, some subjects cannot be easily simplified but instead require people to have the resources to fully understand them. Instead of labeling foods as good or bad based on a letter grade, the European Union should provide more resources so citizens understand that while some foods may be more caloric than others, consuming them in moderation will not hurt them.

In the Spotlight: Diasporas and Political Mobilization,"With Eva Østergaard-Nielsen
Liz Morán and Kali Hanson
Since the 1980s, we have observed an explosive increase in the number of countries that have extended the right to vote from abroad. As a result, today diasporas play a more prominent role in politics than in the past, with the members of diasporas having the possibility to build bridges between States and to promote democracy both in their countries of residence and in their countries of origin.
As this year millions will head to the polls, it is important to reflect on diasporas and political mobilisation and to ask ourselves what role diasporas play in electoral processes. This interview aims to shed light on such a topic thanks to the insights of Professor Eva Østergaard-Nielsen.
Research points that, in many cases, intra-European diasporas are quite populous and their vote can make a difference in national elections. Is this a statement that your research at MIGRADEMO proves that it can be generally extrapolated to diasporas? What role do diasporas play in the electoral and democratic processes of their countries of origin?
We do have examples worldwide of the diaspora vote making a difference in the outcome of the election in their country of origin. But one also has to say that the number of elections where this happened is quite limited compared to how many elections diasporas can vote in. This is because turnout is often low, and it has to be a really close election for the diaspora vote to make a difference in the outcome.
So, we do have cases. For instance, there is the case of Italy in 2006, in which the diaspora vote gave [former Italian Prime Minister Romano] Prodi the majority in the Senate with just one seat. There is also the case of Romania with the 2009 presidential election, where the diaspora vote was decisive and it gathered a lot of attention and was quite influential for the mobilisation of parties abroad. Other cases include Cape Verde, Hungary, New Zealand, and Uruguay. But I think what’s important maybe is a distinction between decisive and influential – I mean there are cases where the diaspora vote boosted certain parties, although it does not necessarily lead to their subsequent win. I think this is still an important role to play from afar.
“There is also the concept of social remittances. Migrants and diasporas may talk to their families and friends at home, explain their situation abroad and discuss economic and political affairs and thereby transfer norms and ideas to their country of origin at the individual and micro-level.”
What we have done atMIGRADEMO–as so do other research projects–is to also look at other ways in which migrants or diasporas can be influential in democratic processes in their countries of origin. For instance, from afar, the migrants can send remittances – which is a fairly big deal for many countries of origin. There is research and literature that shows a democratic impact of this money transfer: the families that receive this money may also then change their electoral behaviour and this can also have an impact in elections on countries of origin. For example, there is research that shows that in contexts with a lot of clientelism, families with migrants abroad that received money may have a lower turnout in elections or be less likely to vote for the incumbent ruling parties.
There is also the concept of social remittances. Migrants and diasporas may talk to their families and friends at home, explain their situation abroad and discuss economic and political affairs and thereby transfer norms and ideas to their country of origin at the individual and micro-level. There are other factors, such as return migration–migrants who return to their countries of origin may bring back with themselves different perspectives –so these are all ways through which migrants can influence electoral and democratic processes at home beyond casting their vote.
In MIGRADEMO we’ve done research and surveys in regions of high out-migration, qualitative work, and interviews with return migrants in civil society and among political elites. However, as other research teams, we were hit by the [Covid-19] pandemic and we could not really go to the field to research these other issues. During the pandemic, we started setting up a dataset calledEmigrant Voting Patterns(EVP), in which we collected data on what emigrants vote in their country of origin insofar possible per country of residence–that is to say, not just all the Italians abroad in the Italian election in 2006 and 2008 and so on, but the vote of Italians in Argentina, the Italians in Spain, and in the US–in order to see whether there was some sort of destination effect on the emigrant vote. However, collecting information on this is quite cumbersome. Sometimes, you just have the total number of votes posted on the electoral website of the country in question. I think we contacted almost all countries in the world and we have 43 countries of origin that communicated the vote per countries of destination. We have 217 destinations and 1267 elections. It is a big data set, and  we are doing research now to discern any patterns.
[At present], we have a paper under review with Laurence Go and Nicolas Fliess that shows, I think interestingly, that turnout in homeland elections is also related to the timing of elections in the country of residence. So, within a timespan, the closer the two are together, emigrants and diasporas tend to vote more in homeland elections when there was recently an election in the country of residence. Moreover, we are now doing research on the difference in the vote–is the vote from abroad different from the vote in the home country?  This is very complicated to do, obviously. It seems that the emigrant vote from afar is more pro-democratic, that there are more votes for pluralist parties, the larger the political distance between the country of origin and country of residence. That is to say, when emigrants move from “less to more democracy”, there seems to be a pattern of voting for more pro-pluralist parties. So, this is still preliminary and a work in progress, but is the direction our research is looking at now.
Nonresident external voting is costlier in terms of time, effort, attention, and sometimes also financially, than voting “at home”. Despite these setbacks, why do diasporas mobilise to vote? What variables and factors push them to do so?
I think this is a correct observation; when we try to explain voting, it is a cost-benefit analysis. But I think it is also important to mention that it is also costly for countries to extend voting rights to citizens residing abroad. The other thing, first off, is to say that voting rights for emigrants are very different from case to case. There are many different modalities through which diasporas can vote: in some cases, you have to drive for hours to your nearest consulate; in other cases, you need to register way in advance, which is also a big obstacle; in some cases, you can vote by mail; and a few countries have allowed online voting which is way less costly compared to the other modalities. So, we must take into account how easy the country of origin makes it to vote from afar.
The other thing to emphasise is that turnout, in general, is low among diasporas compared to the country of origin. So, many emigrants do not bother to turn up or make this effort. Why is that? It is an important question, but we still do not have full answers to why the turnout is low. It is a complicated scenario with lots of different factors to take into account. With Irina Ciornei, some years ago, we did astudyin which we showed there is a destination effect: turnout tends to be higher among diasporas and emigrants when moving from, again, “less to more democracy”. This would indicate that moving to a place where turnout is higher or there are different processes during elections may have a spillover effect into the homeland voting of emigrants.
This is a field still dominated by case studies, and what applies to one case does not necessarily do so for another. Still, there is some evidence to show that political interest and engagement in the country of residence does not reduce political participation in homeland processes and vice versa.
Do there exist differences in regards to political mobilisation and incentives to vote for first generation and second or third-generation diasporas?
That would be an obvious hypothesis: with time and not being born or having as much contact with the country of origin, the interest would wane, and the turnout would be lower. I think we don’t have enough data on a broader scale to answer such a question. But it ties in with the previous question: why would some emigrants vote and others don’t? I think the first stop here is, of course, the citizenship policies of countries of origin and residence. Not all countries allow dual citizenship, although it is a trend that more countries allow it; How long can you retain your citizenship?; Does it get passed down from your parents and grandparents abroad?; and so on and so forth.
Of course, we could imagine that second and third generations may have fewer incentives and interest in their country of origin. But one could also imagine other factors that could override this, such as education and generally higher levels of interest in politics… it is difficult to say.
To the best of my knowledge, I don’t see a big systematic study that answers this question on a broader scale. One must take into account that unless we have survey data, it doesn’t say anywhere whether the vote is from first, second, or third-generation diaspora. You are a citizen, full-stop. With aggregate data; we can’t unpack this question well enough.
Do political parties in their countries of origin specifically target diasporas at some point during electoral campaigning? If yes, how do they do so and how effective is it?
Absolutely! Again, we don’t have data for all elections all over the world, but we do have examples of countries of origin extending their campaigning abroad.
Once the [diaspora and migrant] vote gains more attention in the country of origin–for instance, in the case of Romania after the 2009 presidential elections, where their vote tipped the scale–then more parties would have an incentive to go out and chase this vote. Political parties can do events abroad and send out party leaders to do [political] meetings and engage with diasporas to understand what their specific concerns might be. With Irina Ciornei, some years ago, we did astudyof Spain, Romania, Italy, and France where we showed how party political programmes in these countries increasingly had a longer and longer section in which they specifically addressed emigrants as part of the polity: what do they want and need, issues of retaining social security rights, return policies, support for cultural and social issues abroad (school systems, language programmes). But, you also have parties that campaign abroad on homeland political issues and try to rally the vote around this. There is a growing research field on parties ‘going abroad’.
“transnational campaigning and mobilisation at the transnational level with all the costs that this entails, matters. “
When I did my PhD many years ago in the 1990s before Turkey allowed voting from abroad, I went to meetings where Turkish parties were mobilising the Turkish migrants or citizens in Germany and tying both together: mobilising them around the importance of their homeland but also addressing the issues they were facing, at this point, discrimination and exclusion in Germany. This has been going on ever since.
Nowadays, a lot of campaigning is not done through events but online, through social media. Since long, there have been a lot of examples of political parties having specific social media accounts or parts of their websites addressed to the diaspora vote in order to mobilise from afar.
Now, is it effective? There is a paper by Burgess and Tyburski that shows that party outreach leads to higher turnout. They show that transnational campaigning and mobilisation at the transnational level with all the costs that this entails, matters. But one has to understand also that this is complicated for parties to do and the benefits might not be so high, so there is a cost-benefit analysis of parties in terms of how many resources they want to allocate to cater to this part of the electorate.
In 1980, only 21 countries enfranchised citizens abroad, whereas by 2020, 141 countries did. Why are countries of origin and their politicians increasingly interested in keeping ties with diasporas?
The trend is quite staggering; emigrant enfranchisement has boomed. There are quite a lot of studies on this. The research field mainly started off with a more political theoretical reflection: should emigrants be allowed to vote in homeland elections? And, if they should, based on what? Ethnic or national identity, residence/time spent abroad, *stakeholder theory? It is an interesting debate.
The second debate was to try to understand why so many countries have enfranchised citizens abroad. There are many theories. Some of the general dimensions across comparative studies have been, first, emigrant lobbying: emigrants want this vote and they present it to their homeland government and political parties, sometimes emigrants carry more weight economically in their country of origin, or maybe there is a specific historical justification for them leaving and now from afar wanting to have a voice in homeland politics. Second, we have window of opportunities’ theories, so take Spain as an example. Spain enfranchised Spanish citizens to vote from abroad in the transition to democracy. You see this in many other cases as well, that in a transition to democracy or a very important power shift, the emigrant voting rights get included in the general overhaul of the constitution and the inclusiveness of the franchise. Third, you have domestic politics. Some parties may push for this vote because they believe having this vote coming in from afar might be in their interest or they might have a specific political overall outlook that includes attention to this part of the nation.
One important dimension is also policy diffusion. There are arguments that the trend also embeds itself in seeing that other countries are doing this with some success and… why not follow suit? This is an argument used for instance in the case of Latin America in order to explain the trend of outreach policies and extending voting rights.
We did astudywith Jean-Michel Lafleur and Irina Ciornei, just in Europe, in which we saw that the main drivers of the process of emigrant enfranchisement were centre-right parties. Where you have the left or centre-left pushing for more rights for immigrants, it was the centre-right who would most strongly argue or put the crucial proposal at the time for having emigrant voting rights.
Another important dimension to mention is that not only democracies extend the right to vote to emigrants. We have quite a lot of “electoral autocracies”, that also extend the right to vote to emigrants. This is something I am researching now with Nicholas Fliess. It is kind of a puzzle: autocracies generally want to control elections, so why extend the vote to emigrants when it is much harder to control elections abroad? This is ongoing work, but in general, there is a trend to try to understand outreach policies from autocracies in terms of understanding autocratic survival, which is based on the pillars of repression, legitimization, and co-optation. Voting rights in this perspective is also about controlling and legitimising vis-à-vis the citizens abroad, both in terms of the direct relationship with the citizenry that lives elsewhere, but also with their countries of residence. There can be a signalling value as well, in terms of installing a democratic right sometimes in the context of some form of power transition.
So, there are a lot of factors and arguments, but we must distinguish between different political regimes, processes, and junctures in domestic politics, power struggles and partisan interests in the country of origin, and then, of course, what the emigrants want.
Does diasporic attachment — passive or active — hinder immigrant integration?
No, not necessarily! We still need to understand this better as we don’t have a lot of data. We have the emigrant voting pattern dataset, which is aggregate date (what do all migrants in this country vote?). However, one collective or citizens from one country is usually not very homogenous. There can be different groups within this diaspora based on ethnicity, education, class, type of migration, and so on and so forth.
So, in order to answer this question better, we need micro-data: we need to understand specifically that person and their situation, socioeconomic characteristics, political engagement in the country of residence, etc. However, for a long time, we have had studies, both qualitative research and some surveys, that have shown that there is not a zero-sum relationship between incorporation in the country of residence and engagement in the country of origin. In fact, I tried to argue many years ago, based on qualitative research, that these processes may reinforce each other: as a diaspora, you may go and lobby and be engaged on behalf of your homeland in the politics of your country of residence and that is an entry point into the politics of the country of residence, or vice versa.
“One has to remember that it is a globalised world. The politics of one country are important to the politics of another, and maybe one does not always have to think about processes of political engagement here and there in completely separate or dualistic terms.”
One has to remember that it is a globalised world. The politics of one country are important to the politics of another, and maybe one does not always have to think about processes of political engagement here and there in completely separate or dualistic terms. There is quite a bit of ongoing research on this topic right now. Do migrants bring with them their political orientations? Does attachment to the homeland change in the country of residence through processes of political re-socialization?
It is also relevant to notice that while the increase of countries granting voting rights has boomed, I am not sure we can say that the countries of residence have followed suit in terms of more inclusive policies and voting rights for immigrants there. It could be thought that it’s a bit paradoxical that migrants can move to a country and pay taxes there, and in general incorporate themselves in their country of residence, but they can only vote in their country of origin and not residence. Sometimes, migrants may have a dual embeddedness or a transnational political orientation, but can mainly express it in the ballot box in the country of origin.
You can see how many factors may intervene in these processes. We need to unpack this better to understand it, but in terms of the vote there is no real evidence that diasporic attachment somehow hinders political integration in the country of residence.
*Stakeholder theory: immigrants should be allowed to vote as long as they have some sort of stake in their country of origin, which may not be the case for second or third-generation diasporas.

The Golden Triangle’s City Built on Dirty Money,"For decades, the Golden Triangle, a region between Thailand, Myanmar and Laos along the Mekong River, has been synonymous with opium production, organised crime, and rebel militias. In recent years, the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the north of Laos has come under the control of Chinese casino mogul Zhao Wei, since his Hong Kong-registered company, Kings Romans, leased the land for 99 years.
Visitors to the zone have commented that it runs as a de-facto part of China. Access is generally from Thailand, where a boat crosses the Mekong River. Once through passport control, which Lao citizens are reportedly not allowed to cross, the road signs are in Chinese, the common currency is Renminbi, and the mobile network provider is China Mobile. The Laotian authorities seemingly have no authority here, as private militia from Myanmar conduct the policing.
Crime with Impunity
According toRadio Free Asia, hundreds of Lao women are trapped there in debt bondage. The report states that businesses hire women to work as barmaids or “chat girls” to convince casino visitors to invest in Kings Romans. During this process, the women rack up ever-increasing debts as their sales quotas are impossible to meet. To pay off this debt, they are then forced into prostitution.
When the International Crisis Groupinvestigatedactivities in the SEZ, it discovered compelling evidence of animal trafficking. A team attempted to enter a location marked as a “zoo” on the map, but authorities refused entrance. An employee told the team it was a breeding centre for breeding bears and tigers, confirming reports made by the Environmental Investigation Agency. Visitors state that shops openly sell tiger bone wine around the town along with endangered species in the wet and dry markets, including Chinese giant salamanders, axolotl, and rare albino red-eared slider turtles.
China turns a blind eye to the illicit activities, and even goes as far as promoting Zhao Wei on state-run TV channels as a key figure in the development of Laos. More recently, the zone has become a thorn in the side of the Chinese government due to the proliferation of cyber-scam centres and human trafficking operations, with both affecting domestic security interests. In December 2023, Laotian authorities finally conducted a raid on the region,arresting 462 Chinese nationalsand deporting them back to China.
The United States Treasury Departmentplaced Zhao Weiand his associated “Transnational Criminal Organisation” on a sanctions list, accusing the TCO of engaging in drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, bribery, and wildlife trafficking, through the Kings Romans Casino. It has also designated other connected entities across Laos, Thailand, and Hong Kong the same. Since 2014, Lao, Thai, and Chinese authorities have all reportedly traced seized narcotics (including heroin and methamphetamine) to the casino, and linked the distribution network to the United Wa State Army of Myanmar.
In consideration of these aspects, the existence of such a place presents huge problems for the entire region, both socially and geopolitically. Its strategic location, both on the Mekong River and wedged between the borders of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, while also being close to China’s southwestern border, further exacerbates these concerns. The zone acts as a hub for organised crime and rebel groups to launder money, trade with each other, and operate with impunity.
The Lao government turns a blind eye as the province surrounding the zone goes from one of the country’s poorest, to one of its most well off. Regional authoritiesdeny this stark array of evidence, highlighting concerns of corruption within the area. Instead, the priority is to let the SEZ continue to expand in scope and size, with the local airport potentially gaining an international terminal with direct flights to China.
Above all, Laos, Thailand, and China need a coordinated strategy and collaborative efforts to stop such activities and maintain regional stability. While money may be pouring into the area, it is in fact a ticking time bomb.

(Article) Elections to the Catalan Parliament: Life beyond independence,"Election poster of the PSC-PSOE candidate, Salvador Illa, pasted over that of ERC, Pere Aragonès, the former president of theGeneralitat de Catalunya. Source:El Mundo
The latest elections to the Parliament of Catalonia have been a key turning point in the Catalan and national political landscape. This is the first time that the Catalan parliament  does not have a pro-independence majority. A left-wing bloc pact could give the presidency to the SocialistPartit dels Socialistes de Catalunya(PSC),  Salvador Illa. However, the negotiations will not be easy and once again Catalonia faces uncertainty.
On 13 March, the then president of theGeneralitat, Pere Aragonès (ERC), called early elections in Catalonia for 12 May after failing to pass the Generalitat’s budget bill for 2024. The approval of the last budget of the legislature required multiple pacts that theGovernwas unable to achieve. They reached an agreement with the head of the opposition from PSC, Salvador Illa, andEn Comú Podem. However,  the disagreement arose with  the macro-complexHard Rockproject, which has preventedEn Comú Podemfrom giving their support.

In his institutional declaration,Pere Aragonésdeclared that “Catalonia will choose between responsibility and irresponsibility, between those who defend a model of the past and those who defend Catalonia everywhere, looking to the future”. He assured that the early elections will allow Catalonia to have a Government “with much more strength to continue advancing and accelerating the transformations, without depending on the immobilists“.
Catalonia has a diverse political scene with a wide range of political parties. Thebig national partiesbelonging to the main ideological families – socialists, democrats, and Christian Democrats – have representation in the region. However, the regional parties have recently dictated a political agenda marked by independence and the call for a referendum on self-determination. The main political parties in this latest elections are:
Source:Onda Cero
In a nutshell, independents lost this election. The decline of ERC, which now holds 20 seats, and the slight improvement of Junts (35), lacks the arithmetic to lead an independent government. The PSC found success as the most voted party.Salvador Illa won for the second time in a row to become the leading force in Parliament. He obtains 42 seats andimproves the 33 seats of the 2021 elections. However, the PSC will need pacts to win the presidency of the Generalitat. This will not be easy for Salvador Illa because he needs the support of ERC and theComunsto be able to govern. The candidate forJunts, Carles Puigdemont,won 35 seats, three more than in the last elections. This means that he is ahead of ERC in the battle to lead the pro-independence movement. ERC has fallen to third place after three years at the head of the Government with 20 seats, compared to the 33 seats obtained in 2021. Nevertheless, they will be key to governability.
The rise of thePartido Popular(PP) is noteworthy; this has led to thedisappearance ofCiudadanos-it has lost its 6 deputies-. The PP won 15 seats compared to 3 seats in 2021. It managed to overtake Vox, which is in fourth position, securing the 11 seats obtained in the previous elections. Finally, the CUP lost more than half of its support, winning 4 seats compared to its 9 members. The situation is similar forComuns-Sumar, whose results have worsened from 8 seats to 6. Surprisingly, Silvia Orriols’Aliança Catalanabroke into Parliament with 2 seats.

Since the elections, uncertainty continues regarding who will becomePresidentof the Generalitat. On 10 June, the members of the Parliamentelected Josep Rull(Junts) as president of the chamber. The Bureau of the Catalan Parliament has a pro-independence majority (four of the seven members). This distribution could give priority to an investiture attempt by Carles Puigdemont. The PSC maintains that its chances of reaching the Government remain intact and sees the composition of the Bureau as a minor setback to achieving the presidency.
The elections in Catalonia have opened up a new horizon for the region. Catalan’s politics has been very turbulent since the famous pro-independence process began in 2012 and the population has grown weary. The Catalans’ problems do not go through a referendum on independence. Education, health, infrastructure… This is what the Catalans want to hear. The dreams of independence seem to have been pricked by the needle of reality.","July 01, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/article-elections-to-the-catalan-parliament-life-beyond-independence/,María Vallés González,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Election Countdown: Navigating Bulgaria’s Political Maze Amidst Schengen and Eurozone Struggles,"After only 9 months of regular government, Bulgaria has yet again descended into a political crisis and is left with a new caretaker government. Negotiations for government formation failed days after the country partly joined the Schengen area. This is a crucial moment as assessments for Bulgaria’s full accession to Schengen and the Eurozone are anticipated soon. New parliament elections are scheduled together with the European election on the 9th of June. This will mark the country’s 6th parliamentary elections since 2021.
The summer of 2020 marked a breaking point in the Bulgarian political landscape. Thousands of people took to the streets to express dissatisfaction with the country’s government, judicial system and ongoing corruption. The protests challenged the governing of Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), which was the leading party for more than a decade. The then-approaching parliamentary election resulted in the formation of new political parties and coalitions. While for some citizens this was a step towards bettering the country, in reality, aspiral of political instabilitybegan.
Since April 2021, Bulgaria has had two functioning governments. The first one, a government coalition led by the newly emerged We Continue the Change (PP), lasted for 6 months. The second and most recent one was a grand government coalition between GERB and PP-DB (Yes, Bulgaria!), the base of which was a“gentlemen’s agreement”between the two parties. GERB and PP-DB agreed upon the Prime Minister’s rotation for a year and a half. The first 9 months were led by Nikolai Denkov (PP), after which Mariya Gabriel (GERB) would have taken over.
While not a common practice, the agreement allowed for PP and GERB to put their rivalry aside and form a working pro-European government. Its main points of action were securing full Schengen membership, entry to the Eurozone, judicial system reforms, and providing aid to Ukraine.  At least, when the time came for Gabriel to step into position things did not go smoothly. Tensions between PP and GERB were rising before Denkov’s agreed-upon resignation. GERB proposed a long-term coalition agreement that was not received well by PP-DB. The main reason was the inclusion of the Turkish minority party DPS, the co-leader of which is Delyn Peevski. Peeviski has a controversial reputation due to beingsanctionedby the US for corruption. When PP-DB continued with the agreed-upon rotation, GERB perceived the action as arrogant. And so began the familiar cycle of negotiations, with parties blaming each other for government shortcomings while achieving no tangible results.
After two weeks of going back and forth, GERB and PP-DP failed to negotiate a new government. GERBreasonedthat PP-DP were trying to seize as much power as possible, while PP-DP accused GERB of working together with DPS to hold back reforms in the judicial system. Both parties stated that negotiations would only be possible after new elections.
In March, the president of Eurogroup, Paschal Donohoe, concluded his visit to Bulgaria with thequote“I am strongly convinced that Bulgaria will join the eurozone in 2025”. Denkov’s administration set the 1st of January 2025 as a possible entry date. Nonetheless, following the government collapse, opinions on the matter started to differ. Bulgarian National Bank Governor, Dimitar Radev,estimatedthat the country will be able to join the eurozone later or at the end of 2025. However,Politicoreports that experts find January 2026 more realistic.
For a country to enter the Eurozone, it must meet the four convergence criteria and have national legislation ensuring the independence of the national central bank. Bulgaria has met all but one of these conditions – price stability. To fulfil this requirement, the country’s inflation rate should not be more than 1.5% higher than that of the three best-performing Member States. Bulgaria’s annual inflation rate in 2023 was8.6%, considerably higher than the allowed benchmark. The annual estimate for 2024 is 3.4%, but as of March, the rates have dropped below the estimate. If this trend continues, Bulgaria’s chances of entering the Eurozone increase.
While chances to meet inflation criteria rise, the political instability might stumble the process. Joining the eurozone was a point in the national agenda of the last two regular governments. In 2021 actions to do so did not end up being realized. Dencov’s administration did make efforts towards meeting the convergence criteria, but the political scene remained unstable, with parties blaming each other for the shortcomings. Additionally, a failure to form a regular government after the elections could lead to a new caretaker one, focused on organizing the next election, as has happened before. In such a scenario attention and resources will be moved away from implementing a stable currency transition and maintaining policy cohesion.
In March, Bulgaria and Romania partly joined the Schengen Area, allowing free movement within the zone by air and sea. Land border control remains in place, due to Austria blocking the full accession for both countries. While theEuropean Parliament callsfor full Schengen membership, a date for finalizing the accession has not been set.  The main reason behind Austira’s veto is concerns with Bulgaria and Romania’s abilities to tackle illegal migration.
The topic of migration has always been politicized, especially at the EU level and even more so before EU elections. Bulgarian political parties are no strangers to this phenomenon. To advance its full Schengen accession, Bulgaria hasincreased Frontex officerson the Turkish border and has been granted funds from the EU to help strengthen border control. Around the same time, the country was accused of human rights violations across the border. The Ministry of Interiordeniedthe accusation and has tried to demonstrate adherence to EU standards. However, on a national level,the surge of disinformationabout migration has ended up having a counter effect.
Incidents involving migrants have led to protests against refugee camps. Some of these protests were organized by parties’ representatives, facilitating the narrative that the country is facing a “migration crisis”. The political turmoil in Bulgaria can stumble the negation power of the country. Politicians politicizing migration to gain public support, go against actions made so far for the country to gain full Schengen membership. Such contradictions can be used by Austria or other Schengen members as a reason to further postpone the lift of land border controls.
Bulgaria has been once again left under the rule of a caretaker government. The recent collapse of the coalition government, coupled with the failure to negotiate a new one, has showcased the challenges of governance in a fragmented political landscape. As the country prepares for its sixth parliamentary elections since 2021, the path forward remains uncertain.","June 14, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/election-countdown-navigating-bulgarias-political-maze-amidst-schengen-and-eurozone-struggles/,Elzhana Dimova,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Croatian Political Landscape Post-2024 Parliamentary Elections,"It is the evening of the 17th April on the Ibler Square in Zagreb, and as he watches the preliminary results come in, sweat drips down the forehead of Peđa Grbin, the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP). Although remaining stoic for the cameras while loss seemed increasingly imminent, the SDP leadership and the left-wing opposition were deeply surprised by the results of the Parliamentary elections, especially following the record turnout of over 60%, the largest since the early 2000s. As per the woes of the liberal public, and the triumphant exclamations of the conservatives, this article traces the upheavals post the April election to determine the future of the Croatian political landscape.
Croatian politics has beendominatedby the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) since the country’s independence in 1991, a party that has guided it on its pro-European path until present, cementing its position as a trusted EU and NATO member. Domestically, on the other hand, things have been less than idyllic. From record inflation rates, mass emigration of the highly educated youth, to high profile corruption affairs that have forced dozens of cabinet ministers to resign their position in the past several years, Croatia can be considered one of the corruption capitals of the world.
Despite taking more than ten days forofficial resultsto come in from the National Election Committee (DIP), by the morning of the 18th April even a casual political observer knew that, having seemingly secured 42 seats out of the 76 needed to form a government, the left-wing Rivers of Justice (Rijeke pravde) coalition would need a miracle to dethrone Andrej Plenković, who had just de-facto won his third consecutive term as Prime Minister. As if this had not been enough of a challenge for the health of Croatian democracy, riddled with corruption affairs and with an ever-growing lean towards authoritarianism, Plenković has chosen the far-right Homeland Movement (DP) as his trusted coalition partner, and thus brough the radical right into government for the first time in the country’s history. A former MEP, and once celebrated as a pioneer of EU-like liberal politics with the power to modernize the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), Plenković’s decision to partner with the far-right has now become part of his political legacy.
Not much is known about the exact details of the coalition agreement between HDZ and DP. The latter’s refusal to coexist with the representative of the Serbian national minority, Milorad Pupovac, and their obsession with the past, however, is familiar even to the foreign media.Politicowrites of historical revisionism, allegations of war-crime denial and use of Nazi-era chants as only some of a number of controversies surrounding DP, whose main support comes from rural places in Eastern Croatia. Federico Baccini of EUNewspredictsthat bringing radical nationalists into government will further accentuate the revisionist rhetoric and impact social rights.
Sanja Modrićagrees that the social climate in Croatia has already begun to change. Although the official rhetoric is that the new government will continue on its pro-European course of protecting minority rights and the freedom of media, she contends, the Homeland Movement has no intention of abandoning its “Trumpian manifest”, that will bring about a sharp turn right the likes of which was seen in Poland. Her prediction does not seem to be amiss, as frictions have already risen in the ruling coalition over the selection of the President of the Committee for Human Rights and the Rights of Ethnical Minorities.HDZ suggestedthe appointment of Milorad Pupovac, to which DP, unsurprisingly, did not respond with enthusiasm.Igor Peternel, one of the leading members of Homeland Movement, has even said that the coalition agreement would be declared invalid if Pupovac was elected. Another one of former’spublic statementsthat gives a snippet as to what DP is really about, is his pronouncement that the liberation from the Nazi puppet state in Spring 1945 should actually be considered an occupation day.
One of the mainobjectivesthat DP is hoping to achieve is to bring back the Croatian diaspora from South America, notorious for containining a large number of descendants of the Nazi-puppet state that escaped prosecution in the aftermath of the Second World War. Notwithstanding the absurdity of this undertaking, its irony is in the fact that the election of the radical right into government will likely drive away a disproportionately larger number of the population than the proposed plan to “revitalize Croatia” through emigration could ever hope to attract. It also remains unclear how the Homeland Movement intends to convince these new potential citizens to take on the low paying jobs that are currently performed by foreign workers, although this does not seem to concern their electorate.
The moto on the cover page ofDP’s websiteproudly states “Let’s stop the spread of Brussels authority”, while the first section of theirmanifest, entitled “The Strategy for the Demographic Revival and the Protection of the Family”, reads like a passage directly copy-pasted from the Old Testament; “DP stands for the preservation of the natural moral law, from which the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights derive, and firmly supports the Constitutional provision according to which the family represents women and men”. Alongside their trusted partner, the Croatian Catholic Church, Homeland Movement supports the complete fusion of religion and state, which has already been initiated bypromotingthe conservative religious ideology as part of mandatory high school education, and it is not a stretch to say that Croatia might soon join the likes of El Salvador, Honduras, Senegal, and Laos, in completely erasing the right to abortion from its constitution.
All things considered, the future of Croatian political landscape is looking quite grim. Riddled with corruption affairs and in the hands of the far-right, the government is likely to continue making controversial policies that are celebrated by the conservative rural public, Catholic Church, and nationalists. Now that it has gained significant platform in the mainstream politics, Homeland Movement has both space and opportunity to advance its controversial policies. Its polarizing rhetoric could deepen the ethnic and religious tensions, undo the efforts to improve social and minority rights, and steer Croatia off its pro-EU course.

China or the West? A Look into Fiji’s Foreign Policy,"On 28 March 2024, Fiji’s Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, announced that his government would beremoving Chinese officersembedded within the nation’s police force, citing concerns about Beijing’s expanding presence in the South Pacific region. This controversial move shines a light on recent developments in Fiji-China relations, which have become increasingly strained since Rabuka’s Government took power following Fiji’s most recent general election in 2022.
Fiji’s gradual shift away from China and its growing rapprochement with the West not only mark the beginning of a new era in the nation’s dynamic foreign policy, but may also indicate a broader trend in the South Pacific, considering Fiji’s role as a geopolitical leader in the region.
This article details Fiji’s foreign policy, including its strategic navigation of geopolitical tensions, its long-term goal to balance between China and the West, and its mission to establish itself as an influential regional leader in the South Pacific.

Fiji’s Traditional Foreign Policy and Post-Coup Realignment
Traditionally, Fiji’s trade, economic, and diplomatic relations werestrongly linked to the West, particularly its Commonwealth neighbours, Australia and New Zealand, but also the United States and the European Union. On 5 December 2006, Fiji experienced itsfourth coupsince gaining independence in 1970, in which the military, led by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, ousted then-Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and took control of the government.
While the new military government justified its actions as a necessary “coup to end all coups” that would move the country away from decades of corruption and ethnic tensions, the coup faced harsh condemnation internationally. Australia and New Zealandimposed extensive sanctionson Fiji’s defence and immigration sectors, the US cut $2.5 million in military aid to Fiji, and the Commonwealth suspended Fiji’s membership.
Fiji’s international reputation suffered further after itsconstitution was abolishedin 2009, following a ruling from the Fiji Court of Appeal that declared the 2006 coup illegal and the subsequent military government illegitimate. As a result, Fiji was completely suspended from the Pacific Island Forum and the Commonwealth.
From 2009 onwards, Fiji would pivot its foreign policy away from its traditional Western partners and establish closer economic and diplomatic relations with China, recognising the nation’s rapid rise as a geopolitical and economic superpower wielding great influence over the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative, known as the ‘Look North‘ policy, was welcomed by China with great pleasure. China would rapidly increase its provision of development aid to and investment in Fiji in the years following 2009.

Fiji’s Rapprochement with the West as a Response to the Rise of China
Following the 2009 constitutional crisis and subsequent estrangement from its traditional Western partners, Fiji publicly committed to scheduling general elections for 2014. This move was formalised with the establishment of Fiji’snew constitutionin 2013, drafted under Bainimarama’s Government with the aim of giving ethnic Indo-Fijians the same status as indigenous Fijians. This return to democratic norms and valuesmended Fiji’s relationswith its traditional Western allies, with Australia and New Zealand restoring full diplomatic relations with Fiji, and the US resuming its security and financial assistance to the nation.
While this new arrangement initially appeared to be a win for Fiji’s foreign policy, allowing the nation to enjoy full diplomatic and economic relations with both China and the West, domestic and regional challenges presented Fiji with the dilemma to choose between them.
Fiji’s 2022 electionwas a pivotal one, with the narrow victory of a three-party coalition led by Sitiveni Rabuka resulting in the ousting of Frank Bainimarama, who had been in power since the 2006 coup. Under Rabuka, Fiji has taken a significantly more cautious stance towards China. WhileRabuka has expressedthat he is “more comfortable dealing with traditional friends” such as Australia, he has also acknowledged both China’s contribution of foreign aid to Fiji, stating that China’s Belt and Road Initiative aligns with Fiji’s development agenda.
Rabuka remains concerned aboutBeijing’s growing presencein the Pacific and its potential to undermine democracy in the region, warning that Fiji and the broader Pacific region do not want to beforced to choosebetween the US and China amidst their intensifying rivalry.
Since the 2022 election, Fiji’s relations with China have become increasingly strained. In January 2023, Rabukaterminated a memorandum of understandingbetween Fiji’s Police Force and China’s Ministry of Public Security, which had established joint police training activities between the two nations. Rabuka explained that due to fundamental differences between Fiji and China’s democratic and legal systems, Fiji would focus on collaborating with nations with similar systems, indicating closer security ties with the West, particularly Australia and New Zealand.

Implications on the Pacific Region
So, what are the implications of Fiji’s shift in foreign policy for the rest of the Pacific region? Well, several other Pacific Island nations, as well as the broader international community, have expressed concern about China’s growing influence in the region. BothJapanand theUShave taken a plethora of measures to contain Beijing’s influence in the Pacific, including new foreign aid packages, infrastructure funding for hospitals, roads, and bridges, and assistance for climate change mitigation and disaster relief.
While it is easy to assume that the Pacific Island nations can simply cut their political and economic ties with China, the matter of the fact is that most of the Pacific remains highly dependent on China for resources and development aid. Between 2006 and 2017, China provided nearlyUS$1.5 billion in foreign aidto the Pacific through a combination of grants and loans, becoming the region’s third-largest donor by 2017.
In fact, a growing number of Pacific Island nations have strengthened their diplomatic ties with China. UponTaiwan’s election of Lai Ching-teearlier this year, whose government advocates for an independent Taiwan, Nauru transferred its diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing, and Tuvalu’s pro-Taiwan Prime Minister lost his seat in the nation’s general election.
To counter China’s growing influence in the Pacific region, it is in the best interests of Pacific Island nations to work together as anindependent, unified bloc. Fiji’s traditional role as a regional leader in the Pacific, combined with its experience spearheading both the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF), places the nation in a strong position to assert its leadership in the region and chart a new path for the future.
As both China and the US continue to increase their influence in the Pacific, the island nations in the region appear to be increasingly faced with the difficult decision of having to choose between the two superpowers. However, Fiji’s foreign policy and its enduring commitment to Pacific regionalism demonstrate that there are indeed pragmatic alternatives to strict alignment with either superpower. Fiji serves as a successful case study of a Pacific Island nation that has managed to strategically navigate increasing geopolitical tensions, and the world will be watching closely as developments in the Pacific region continue to unfold.
Questions
1. Is Pacific regionalism effective in allowing the Pacific Island nations to forge their own path separate from the interests of China and the US?
2. Do you think Fiji is heading towards total realignment with its traditional Western partners, or is this yet another demonstration of Fiji’s flexibility when it comes to its foreign policy?
3. Do you think the US or China is currently “winning” the diplomatic race in the Pacific region? What may be the long-term outcomes?

WHAT PROSPECTS FOR EU ENLARGEMENT? HOW KOSOVO AND UKRAINE SHAPED THE EU ENLARGEMENT,"The creation of the EU is idealistically rooted in achieving perpetual peace among former arch-enemies in Europe. While the Union has developed into an economic power, political and security concerns were fundamental to its foundation, as the determination to prevent a repeat of the horrors of the two World Wars convinced European leaders to unite. «In order not to allow Europe’s own past to become its future,integrationhas been made an aim in itself, and an explicit link between security and integration has been constructed».  To enter the Union, two key ingredients are necessary. The first is technical, involving the conditions candidate countries must meet to join, known as the Copenhagen criteria. The second is political, concerning the willingness of EU member states to accept new members, which increases with their perception of security threats. This article will focus on the second one, drawing a parallel between the impact of the war in Kosovo (1998-1999) and the war in Ukraine (2022-ongoing) on EU enlargement.
The impact of the Kosovo War
During the European Council in Copenhagen in 1993, theCopenhagen criteriafor membership were defined. Since then, to enter the Union a country must 1) ensure the stability of institutions that guarantee democracy, uphold the rule of law, and protect human rights and minority rights; 2) demonstrate a functioning market economy capable of handling competition and market forces; 3) possess the administrative and institutional capacity to effectively implement the acquis, adopting and enforcing the comprehensive laws and standards required for membership, and showing readiness to fulfill all related obligations. The definition of the Copenhagen criteria was fueled by the trembling security situation at the Union’s external borders, provoked by the end of the Cold War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the ethnic conflicts in Yugoslavia. These geopolitical and security concerns made EU leaders consider the entry of ex-Soviet republics into the Union. During this period, however, EU leaders prioritized ensuring that candidate countries adhered to the required standards for democratic governance, human rights, and economic stability, which are central to the Copenhagen criteria, over the immediate strategic and geopolitical considerations for expanding the Union. That was clearly stated during the 1997 Luxembourg European Council: «the enlargement process should adhere to its iron rule, that is, to start the accession negotiations with candidate countries which fulfilled all the Copenhagen criteria». The NATO operation in Kosovo in 1999 altered this balance, shifting more weight onto the EU’s political will for enlargement. «The EU was mainly driven by the growing sense within the EU that apreventive measurewas needed if Europe wished to avoid ethnic conflicts like Kosovo to spread to the rest of the Balkan region». This change in perspective is well illustrated by the British government’s statements, which suggested that when candidate countries face clear threats in their region, the EU should begin negotiations with them to counteract these threats, prioritizing this over full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. This idea was widely accepted by nearly all member countries during 1999.
To justify its change of approach, the EU described Kosovo as an existential threat to the EU which required emergency measures. «One of thekey lessons of the Kosovo crisisis the need to achieve peace and security, democracy and the rule of law, growth and the foundations of prosperity throughout Europe. Enlargement is the best way to do this. There is now a greater awareness of the strategic dimension to enlargement». The Commission proposed abandoning the hard line that negotiations could begin only once all three Copenhagen criteria were fulfilled. Instead, they introduced a new rule to open negotiations with candidates that have established functioning democratic structures, enabling the EU to contribute to peace and security in these countries. What is interesting is that the main beneficiaries of the new sense of urgency brought about by the war in Kosovo were not the countries in the Balkan region but two Eastern European countries that had been left out of accession negotiations due to their poor rate of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria: Romania and Bulgaria. It is true that in May 1999, the Commission proposed new Association Agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia Montenegro, Macedonia, and Albania. These agreements aimed to support democracy, the rule of law, economic development, and regional cooperation, offering the prospect of future integration into the European structure. However, at the end of 1999, the EU opened accession negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria, something that would have been impossible before the Kosovo war, and they formally entered the EU in 2007.
The potential impact of the Ukraine war
As the war in Kosovo was framed as an existential threat to European security, the war in Ukraine is similarly raising concerns about a direct confrontation with Russia. In herspeechpresenting the 2023 Enlargement Package, President of the Commission Ursula Von der Leyen said: «Enlargement is an investment in our security. Because integrating new members in the European Union also shields them from foreign interference, and it therefore stabilizes our neighborhood. In times where we see the rules-based international order increasingly called into question, of course a larger and stronger European Union gives us a stronger voice in the world». These words confirm how enlargement is increasingly interpreted as a «political toolat [EU] disposal to respond to security challenges on its periphery». The security threat posed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine is increasing the EU political will to let new member in, providing new momentum for enlargement. As it happened in 1999, less emphasis is placed on the Copenhagen criteria nowadays, and more on the security benefits of enlargement. «The real measure of [the EU]absorption capacityis whether member states can reach any political consensus about when to enlarge and under what conditions. […] These considerations are ultimately far more important than technical or legal ones». However, just as the Kosovo crisis prompted the enlargement toward Romania and Bulgaria, the Ukraine war may finally place the Balkan region as a top item on the union’s agenda. This renewed drive for enlargement is found in theGrowth Plan for the Western Balkans, released by the European Commission in November 2023. The plan focused on the technical conditions necessary for EU accession, particularly emphasizing economic criteria. However, these criteria were detailed only following a shift in EU perspective driven by the heightened security threat.
Conclusions
Following the European Parliament elections in June 2024, the next EU leadership faces the task of setting future priorities regarding enlargement. Security and defense were central topics in this year’s EU elections, with EU leaders emphasizing the need to fully support Ukraine against an existential threat that will shape the future of European security. While security and defense dominated public discourse, enlargement did not receive significant attention. Such a pattern was observed since the 1990s, when EU leaders preferred to establish consensus at the institutional level before presenting a unified stance to the public. Today, another reason why politicians tend to avoid discussing enlargement publicly is the concern that this topic may be exploited byfar-right partiesto attract voters. For instance, farmers have protested not only against environmental policies but also against imports of grain from Ukraine and the country’s potential entry into the EU.

Securing Tomorrow: The BND and German Foreign Intelligence,"The Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) is Germany’s foreign intelligence service and is an integrated tool of the German republican democracy. It has recently gained widespread media attention following a series of counterintelligence operations and public debate has emerged about its effectiveness as an intelligence service. This article examines the BND’s tasks, structure, and fundamental differences compared to conventional foreign intelligence services.
The BND’s nature and limitations are closely tied to Germany’s history and the origins of the German republican system that emerged after the Second World War. To comprehend the nature of the BND, Germany’s security policies, and the contents of its constitution and justice system, it is vital to first understand how deeply ingrained the reflection of the Third Reich era is in the minds of German decision-makers and the general public. This makes understanding the story of how the BND came to be all the more challenging to an interested outsider.
It seems that in the early years of its existence, the BND was not entirely forthcoming about its existance and true tasks. It was initiated by Reinhard Gehlen, head of Wehrmacht intelligence on the Eastern Front, who, fearing retaliation by the Soviet Red Army, hid intelligence on the Soviet Union gathered by his agents over the years and offered it to the U.S. in exchange for his and his men’s safety and fair treatment. The allies were quick to recognize the value of German intelligence as the Soviet Union’s aggressive posture as the primary competitor amongst the allies in Europe became increasingly clear throughout the late 1940´s. The U.S. initiated “Organization Gehlen“, which in its early years was primarily focused on gathering intelligence on the USSR and the Soviet Armed Forces in Europe.
As time passed, Organization Gehlen expanded and reorganized itselfo into the primary foreign intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1956, with Gehlen serving as its first president. The Weimar Republic and its failings served as a cautionary tale for the young democracy and its constitution, known as the Grundgesetz. As part of this approach, the BND is subject to significant limitations set forth in Germany’s intelligence law and is required to maintain high transparency and accountability to the German parliament. Parliament have a dedicated group of members from various parties responsible for overseeing its affairs by means of theParliamentary Oversight Panelwith the government obligated to report on BND activities when inquiries take place. Furthermore, an internal body of the Federal Chancellery is responsible for maintaining high accountability of the BND and its 6,000 members while another agency is responsible for financial audits.
It would at first appear that the BND cannot extensively gather information in a way that would comply with the various domesticdata protection laws. The 2016 legal reform only established further oversight measures, such as an independent panel. However, given the lack of legal precedent and the complexity of intelligence domains such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), the reform and the bills proposed by the German government following the 2020 Federal Court decision leave room for loopholes regarding foreignstrategic surveillance.
On the other hand, it is not an executive organ and does not have the right to employ violence, such as apprehending suspects or engaging in armed operations abroad. Germany would rely on its army or allied foreign intelligence services to conduct hostage releases or engagements requiring brute force. Its self-proclaimed task is to gather information on global affairs and present data in intelligence packages to policy-makers so that they may adjust their foreign and security policies accordingly.
The German government keeps its information-gathering directives on other nations a secret. However, a reasonable estimation suggests gathering intelligence on international terrorist networks as a primary objective. If alarming information comes to light, the BND notifies the relevant authorities, who then apprehend the terrorist suspects promptly.
In recent years, reports of foreign intelligence services infiltrating and spying on both the German intelligence structures and its political ranks have increased. Such incidents highlight the potential risks of BND infiltration by non-affiliated intelligence services. For example, in 2022, Carl L., a division head within the BND, was detained for allegedly working closely with the Russian domestic intelligence agency, the FSB, and transmitting vital data about the war effort in Ukraine through an intermediary that was also detained. It goes without saying that this would have been a serious breach of the BND’s internal security and would have jeopardized the agency’s assets. While it is encouraging that he was discovered before he could cause further damage, it raises questions about the extent to which belligerent actors have infiltrated German state organs and gained access to highly classified files.
The Russian Federation, having developed a robust presence in Germany over the years, poses one of the biggest security challenges. Examples of concerns include instances of violence, such as the murders in Berlin’s Tiergarten Park in 2016. Russian hackers are allegedly responsible for a significant number of cyberattacks on German infrastructure and political figures. For example, the headquarters of the SPD, the party of the current chancellor, recently experienced a cyberattack and just last week as of the publishing of the article, CNN has reported that US and German intelligence services have uncovered and doiled an assasination plot by Russian intelligence aimed atRheinmetallCEO Armin Papperger.
While German counterintelligence focuses on Russian assets in Germany, Chinese espionage has also increased in recent years. Police arrested a European Parliament aide for far-right candidate Maximilian Krah (AfD) on suspicion of spying for the PRC, sparking nationwide outrage. In addition, three Germans were arrested, with one in particular alleged to have collaborated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security in an attempt to transfer high-level dual-use technology and scientific knowledge to the PRC to be used for military purposes.
In the context of legal limits, these considerations raise questions about the BND’s ability to conduct its operations effectively within the framework of Olaf Scholz’sZeitenwende. Scholz uses this term to describe a readjustment of foreign and security policy to address the resurgence of power politics and aggressive posturing by international competitors. It also shows a competent conduction of the constitutionally-mandated job.
When compared with neighbouring allies, Germany faces different security threats with policies focusing on separate areas. German policymakers should focus on three main areas of espionage: protecting the country from Russian infiltration, which seems to have had some success; protecting its research and industrial products of a dual-use nature; and combating terrorism. As a result, Germany is more of a counterintelligence power that is a vital partner to allied intelligence sharing efforts than one that excels in offensive espionage. On the other hand, given the highly classified nature of the details, it is not easy to pass judgment.

What lies ahead for the EU-Mercosur agreement?,"In December 2023, the twenty-year negotiation efforts around the EU-Mercosur agreement were thought to finally culminate with the approval of a definitive text that could be agreed upon by all parties. The deal between the two regional blocs shouldserveto foster and reinforce mutual trade, political and cultural ties, by liberalising trade exchanges, integrate value chains and shape trade relations through high standards and shared values of democracy and rule of law. However, negotiations have been underway for more than twenty years and the situation in the near future is not likely to change.
In the past year, there was a conjuncture of ideally positive conditions to finally close the deal, but this was not yet the case. Under European pressures, the latest negotiating efforts were mostly focused on the integration of environmental, sustainable development and human rights-related provisions in the agreeement text. To this end, there were hopes that the comeback ofenvironmentally-sensitive President Lula in Braziland Brazil’s rotating Mercosur presidency would have helped get environmental protection in trade regulations back in the spotlight, as opposed to what former President Jair Bolsonaro did. On the other side,Spain’s rotating presidencyat the Council of the European Union in the same year had embraced the need to ensure EU’s open strategic autonomy, by emphasising the strategic role of Latin America. None of these two lived up to theexpectationsthey had raised.
In January, EUfarmersstarted taking over highways in France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Belgium to voice their concerns about the state of play of agriculture in Europe. Among their preoccupations, are the unbalanced environmental regulations and the increasing competition of non-EU products in the European market. Considering the approaching elections in the EU, Member States’ governments have tried to mitigate farmers’ protests by siding their requests with the concession of incentives and the approval of a revision of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). Aside from EU Member States’ official postures, the fierce protests of European farmers have cast light on some key elements that have long embodied the main divide. In this conjuncture, the EU-Mercosur agreement is suffering a major setback. What does its future look like and why is it so important? Let’s explore.
The EU-Mercosur agreement
The beginning of the EU-Mercosur negotiations dates back to1999, when the EU was the first trade partner of Mercosur, a common market organization, whose founding members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivia has also recently become a full member of Mercosur, whileVenezuela’s membershipwas suspended in 2017. In the last 25 years,the situation has changedconsiderably, with China overtaking the EU as the first trade partner of Mercosur countries and absorbing 29% of the total exports of the area. Despite the declining trade exchanges between Mercosur and the EU, negotiators have maintained their efforts to close a deal that not only concerns trade, but also political dialogue and cooperation. The deal indeed intends to strengthen trade, political, and cultural ties between the EU and Mercosur.
As far as thetrade pillaris concerned, the deal would entail the elimination of tariffs on 91% of EU goods exported to Mercosur (i.e., cars, pharmaceuticals, clothing). Likewise, it would eliminate import duties on 92% of Mercosur goods imported into the EU. In the case of agricultural goods, the deal envisions different scales of liberalization to protect the products that would suffer stronger external competition in Europe.
Trade stands out as the most controversial and conflicting pillar, which has contributed to delaying the definition of a final text. Towards the end of 2019, negotiators agreed in principle on a final version of the deal, which should have undergone ratification by both the EU Member States’ national parliaments and the European Parliament. After achieving this final version, farmers’ interest groups started lobbying against the ratification process, while environmentalist civil society associations and parties claimed that the agreement would have contributed to harming Mercosur countries’ environment and deepening inequalities. From that moment on, the negotiation table has focused on amending the trade pillar to include specificenvironmental, sustainable development, and human rights-related provisions.
The integration of environmental provisions proved to be the most controversial and debated. Indeed, Mercosur countries have seen them as astrategy of the EUto further prolong negotiations or even interrupt them, by insisting on what the former perceive as subtle protectionist measures. Despite the ideally favorable conditions to get the deal closed in December, a combination of complications took a toll on it. Among these, the change of presidency in Argentina and its proximity to the decisions around the agreement’s revised text impeded outgoing President Fernández from making a final decision on it. President Milei, who had already expressed his skepticism around Mercosur during his electoral campaign, has manifested a willingness tonegotiate a new agreementwith the EU. Complicating things further are other Mercosur members, such as Bolivia and Uruguay, which have strong diplomatic and trade ties with China, their first trade partner.Uruguayhas made explicit its willingness to close a deal between Mercosur and China, as opposed to the one with the EU. Chinese competition in the region is one of the main challenges for the EU to scale up its presence and also a driver to successfully close the deal with Mercosur.
On the other side,EU Member States are dividedon this matter. Some of them see the peril of EU farm production being undermined by cheaper foreign products that do not comply with EU environmental standards. Thus, they ask for“mirror clauses”to impose the same social, sanitary, and environmental regulations in force in the EU on imported goods. This is especially the case of France and President Macron’s overall skepticism of the deal. On the other hand, Germany stands out as the main promoter of the EU-Mercosur agreement, attracted by the new trade opportunities deriving from the liberalization of European car and car parts exports. Earlier this year, the fierce protests of European farmers have once again thrown light on the elements of friction that in part explain the long negotiation process and the lack of consensus among large sectors of the European population.
EU farmers’ protests: what is at stake with the EU-Mercosur agreement?
On the wave of farmers’ protests in Europe, on 31 January 2024, Copa-Cogeca, the largest farmers and farming cooperatives lobby in the EU, sent a letter to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Among the various requests it reported, there was the need to “ensure reciprocity in farm production standards and a level playing field to ensure fair trade”. This directly pointed to diverse ongoing international trade negotiations, of which the EU-Mercosur agreement is just the most emblematic example. The letter explicitly reads “A continuous push for getting the deal across the line will be perceived as a further provocation by the farming community and will increase the rejection for decisions taken by the European Commission”.
Overall, at the heart of farmers’ discontent are the increasing and exacerbated environmental regulations approved within the EU, the limited profit margin, the increasing bureaucracy, and unfair competition from non-EU products. In light of this, farmers see any international trade agreements that do not impose the same standards in force in the EU as a threat to the profitability and security of EU farm production.
The European Commission and Member States haverespondedby delaying the implementation of the Green Deal agenda and the revision of specific environmental standards, among others. Yet, such responses will have a near-term impact only. Farmers’ discontent has a much bigger scope and, for the moment, it seems to be finding the highest support amongright-wing and far-right parties. In a scenario where these latter predominate in the European Parliament’s new majority, a more protectionist posture could be adopted regarding international trade. Whereas, if liberal or progressive parties were to predominate, then they would likely support international trade negotiations with a more open approach.
Is failure even an option at the negotiating table?
Whichever will be the electoral result in the EU, the agreement goes well beyond agriculture and concerns theglobal positioningof both regional blocs in an extremely volatile context from both the geopolitical and geoeconomic perspectives. The consequences of the war in Ukraine have taught the EU an essential lesson on theneed to diversifyits supply chains as a way to increase resilience vis-à-vis external negative dynamics. In this sense, the EU-Mercosur deal would be perfectly consistent with such a goal, by intensifying new or existing trade routes and contributing to reaching the goal of strategic autonomy. Yet, this narrative clashes with the unpopularity of the deal among several EU Member States, which puts national leaders in a difficult position when it comes to its endorsement.
On the other side of the Atlantic, Mercosur has been facing increasingcriticismfrom its member states. During his electoral campaign, Javier Milei asserted Argentina would have withdrawn from the membership, only to revise his radical postures after his election. Other member states, such as Uruguay, have long insisted on the need to make Mercosur more flexible by allowing member states to also negotiate bilateral trade agreements, not only as a bloc. The regional integration process within Mercosur has slowed down in the last few years, also because of the lack of political efforts in this direction. Therefore, there are many challenges on both sides which could potentially lead to the failure of the negotiations or to finding new ways to reach an agreement. EU Trade Commissioner Vladis Dombrovskis affirmed that thecommitmentto close the deal remains firm, although developments at the negotiating table are not expected in the near term.

The Cost of Living in a Politically Fragmented Europe,"Fight against poverty and social exclusion areEU citizens’ top priorityat the moment, with support to the economy and employment opportunities a close second. These are the campaign topics they wish to discuss and address as Europe prepares for the formation of its next Parliament. Voters’prioritiesseem to have shifted from their last electoral poll.
The end of the 2019 European elections marked the start of itspolycrisis. Economic instability and inflation rates began to rise in 2021 when the world was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine further exacerbated the situation, disrupting supply chains and pushing many countries, specifically Europe, to the brink of a crisis. Due to the unforeseen and continued existence of inflationary pressures, the prices of essential commodities such as natural gas, crude oil, coal, and food items such as wheat, maze, and edible oils were subjected to an unexpected surge. In Europe, increased energy prices were the driving force of high inflation. However, they were not the sole reason. Rising real profits in member states such as Italy, France, and Germany were not accompanied by a proportionate increase in real wages. Therefore, despite regulations and policies to support its citizens, both national governments and the EU havefailed to satisfythem with their response. The EU’s failure to effectively tackle the rising inflation, housing, and job crisis is down to the extreme polarisation of the policy issue and a divided approach to solving the problem.
Polarised Political Spectrum
Polarisation of policy issues has been at the core of European politics and for many years now, the right-wing parties have capitalised on economic crises. They have been successful in amplifying negative emotions and nationalistic sentiments in the citizens, thus gaining popularity and support on this issue.
Divided Economic Vows
When it comes to the ongoing economic difficulties, ideological groupings have different ways of handling the crisis. The right wing of the European Parliament includes the central-right European People’s Party (Christian Democrats/EPP), the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR),  Renew Europe, and the newly formed Nationalist Party, Identity and Democracy. EPP argues for ‘European competitiveness’ as its market suffers from global inflationary pressures. The party wants to fight overregulation. Similar to the EPP, the ECR also advocates for reinforcing the single market, slashing red tape, bringing innovation in technologies, and supporting energy security. Renew Europe emphasises investment, especially in the SMEs, echoing the vows of similar ideological groups. The parties of the right signal their compatibility with a joint emphasis on competitiveness and a single market. These parties, however, are divided on non-economic issues such as foreign policy, environmental strategies, social issues, healthcare, and education.
The Progressive Alliance for Socialists and Democrats (S&D) takes on a different approach to the issue. S&D’s agenda is a newGreen Social Deal, mitigating climate and social matters through tackling the energy crisis. This view aligns with the Greens’ focus on green investment, which sought to ‘inject’ profits of fossil fuel companies as investments in green projects.
For the Left group in the European Parliament (GUE/NGL), increasing inequalities, tax evasion, and the lack of adequate investment in public services are the three most important issues to tackle. The group addresses social insecurities and inequalities through public investment and green transitions.  The European left also supports introducing aEuropean tax on the rich. All this would mean a major transfer of economic power to the European level. The Eurosceptic orientation of the European left is committed to deleting the rules of theStability and Growth Pactto increase social and environmental spending and counter cyclical fluctuations.
A solution to the crisis
It has been four years since the cost-of-living situation escalated, yet prices continue to rise. According to theEuropean Central Bank, inflation for the euro area will likely average 2.6% in 2024 against the ECB’s 2% target. People are unhappy with their current living conditions. While a new Parliament seems like a beacon of hope, the issue of this economic crisis is not confined to a single legislative body. The solution lies not in the hands of a single ideological group but rather an amalgamation of all of them.

(Analysis) China-North Korea: Brotherhood or Strategic Necessity?,"China and North Korea are often regarded as close allies. Despite harsh international sanctions, China has demonstrated its support by providing North Korea with economic aid, trade, and resources. Beyond economic assistance, the unique mutual defense agreement,Sino-North Korean Treaty of 1961, obliges China to intervene against unprovoked aggression. This treaty underscores the strategic depth of their relationship. Officials from both sides often refer to their relationship as a“brotherhood”. However, is this really the case? Evidence suggests it may not be as close as it appears. Evolving dynamics influence developments in the Korean Peninsula and the broader Asian region.
Historically, the fight against Japanesecolonialismplayed a crucial role in aligning China and North Korea. In the 1930s,Kim Jong Unled Korean guerrillas in northeastern China, fighting alongside Chinese soldiers against Japanese colonizers. Such alliance on the battlefield became the cornerstone for the establishment of friendship. China and North Korea formally declared close relations in October 1949, shortly after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. This declaration was a significant step in solidifying the alliance between the two countries, which has endured for decades.
Geographically, China and North Korea share a border, ensuring their close relations. This proximity facilitates economic exchanges, security cooperation, and cultural interactions, further strengthening their alliance.

Beyond geography, the evolution of the China-North Korea alliance can be explained by the persistence of communist ideology and the single-party system in both countries. Moreover, shared interest in defending communism and opposing foreign powers like, the United States. The Korean War (1950-53), when Chinese troops flooded the Korean Peninsula to aid their northern ally against the US-led South, exemplifies how their relationship has evolved through ideological alignment.
On the other hand, continued economic and social support from China to North Korea further cemented this bond. China still accounts for over90%of North Korea’s total trade, for example, food and energy imports. China’s capacity to shield Pyongyang from economic and political pressure positions Beijing as a crucial player in efforts to influence North Korea.
Consequently, some scholars characterize the relationship between China and North Korea as that of“big brother” and “little brother”. In this age-old dynamic, China plays the “big brother,” while North Korea is the “little brother.” Ideologically, and socially, North Korea has belonged to the Chinese zone of influence. Shared threat perceptions have also fostered cooperation between the two countries. However, this partnership is not between equals. China, being vast, powerful, and economically strong, has always been the dominant party, making North Korea a client state in this relationship.
To truly grasp the roots of this distrust, it is essential to understand the goals driving the leaders in both countries.
For North Korea, the ultimate goal isregime survival and securing state autonomy. This objective is particularly pronounced in the current era under Kim Jong-un’s leadership. Young Kim faces numerous challenges, including economic and social hardships. Political oppression and a growing inability to instil fear among its citizens. These difficulties have led to a breakdown of loyalty not only among the masses but also within the party. Theincreasing number of defectorsis alarming for Kim as well.
Uncertainties loom over a potential fourth dynastic succession, fueled by frequentrumoursabout Kim Jong-un’s ailing health. There areconsiderations of grooming his teenage daughter, Kim Ju Ae, as the next leader of the Kim dynasty. Traditions may hinder this transition as there is no precedence of passing leadership to a female member. Reducing Chinese influence in politics has been crucial for upholding North Korea’s state autonomy. China, often perceived as the “big brother,” has historically wielded influence through high-ranking North Korean officials. However, Kim and his administration have actively worked to diminish Chinese involvement in North Korean affairs, seeking to rebalance the uneven relations with China.
These concerns shape North Korea’s objectives and contribute to the complexity of its relationship with China. Particularly in terms of securing the Kim dynasty and reducing China’s influence.
One of China’s key objectives is to expand its influence in the international arena. China’s active engagement in global affairs, exemplified by its role as a core member of the UN Security Council, is pivotal in achieving this goal. Maintaining a positive international reputation is paramount for China, particularly in its dealings with North Korea.
Simultaneously, China seeks to uphold its power dynamics and aspire to become the regional leader. With the United States, under former President Trump, aiming to reduce its presence in Asia, China perceives an opportunity to assert itself as the regional leader. Consequently, considerations about their international reputation and concerns about regional dynamics become significant factors in China’s approach to dealing with North Korea.
There have been considerable frictions between China and North Korea over the years. The loss of Japan as a shared common enemy has strained the once-strong bond between China and North Korea. They now prioritize different objectives and pursue divergent interests. Unlike the earlier leaders of both countries, who shared the experience of fighting against Japanese colonialism, the new, younger leaders lacked this common background. This absence of shared history provides them with less incentive to strongly invest in preserving their relationship.
The Korean War marked the first significant source of tension between the two countries. Despite their alliance during the conflict, underlying distrust began to surface. At that time,Chinawas not fully invested in the war, as the Taiwan Strait crisis diverted its attention. China’s support for North Korea was primarily driven by its national security interests. Theheavy casualtiessuffered by both sides, including approximately half a million soldiers killed or wounded and thedeath of Mao’s son, further strained their relationship. North Korean leadersblamedChinese military officials for failing to reunify the Korean peninsula. These factors reveal a level of distrust between China and North Korea, indicating that their relationship may not be as close as commonly perceived. These tensions have also sown the seeds of further discord, contributing to ongoing complexities in their relationship.
China’s reform and opening-up policies led to an economic boom and reconnected the country with the international arena, gradually establishing China as a crucial player on the global stage both economically and politically. The adoption of Sino-capitalism and the development of relationships with “rival” countries like the United States and South Korea were viewed by North Korea as abetrayal.
The manifestations of such distrust are actively reflected in the actions and responses from both sides. These suggest shifting dynamics between China and North Korea, taking into account their respective objectives. It is a strategic game played out by the two parties, extending beyond mere brotherhood.
Similar to his predecessors, Kim Jong Un has actively worked to remove foreign involvement to consolidate his power and secure his regime. There is a long history of the Kim dynasty eliminating foreign influence. Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, North Korea’s founder Kim Il Sung,removed pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factionswithin the senior leadership in the years following the Korean War.
The death of Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Un’s brother, in 2017 further exemplifies North Korea’s defiance of Chinese influence. AlthoughKim Jong Namwas disinterested in politics, he maintained close ties with China, supported Chinese-style economic reforms, and lived under Chinese protection. This connection made Kim Jong Nam a perceived threat in Kim Jong Un’s eyes, especially if China ever sought to replace him. Adding to the intrigue, the assassination occurred one day after a missile launch. While Chinese officials remained muted on the issue, stating that the killing did not occur on Chinese soil. Experts commented that the event revealed North Korea’s defiance of China,undermining China’s international reputationand sending a message that China could not control North Korea.

North Korea’s nuclear and missile development is another significant point of contention between China and North Korea. Although North Korea’s nuclear programme began in 1965 with assistance from the Soviet Union and China. China’s stance has evolved as its strategic objectives have shifted. China has become more cautious in handling North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
Historically, China has viewed North Korea as acrucial buffer zone. While a nuclear-armed North Korea could potentially limit actions from the United States. North Korea’s aggressive missile tests have created challenges for China. These tests, seemingly beyond China’s control, have raised concerns. Despite Chinese officials not openly denouncing North Korea’s actions, theirinabilityto influence Pyongyang has undermined China’s reputation.  Moreover, North Korea’s continued nuclear development has alarmed nearby countries like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, as well as the U.S. This has led to thestrengthening of military and security alliancesto counter potential threats. Therenewed U.S. presence in Asia is not desirable for China, complicating its strategic interests in the region.
North Korea’s actions, including its nuclear and missile development, can be seen as a strategic move to rebalance the “little-big brother” dynamic with China. By developing its own nuclear arsenal, North Korea demonstrates its ability to defend itself independently, reinforcing its sovereignty and reducing the perception of being a subordinate ally. A nuclear-armed North Korea can use its capabilities as abargaining chipin international negotiations, thereby increasing its strategic value without relying on China. The2018 meeting between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trumpillustrates how nuclear weapons serve as strategic leverage for North Korea. This meeting had the potential to sideline China from the negotiations, which could harm China’s geopolitical interests. This forced China torestore tieswith North Korea to maintain its regional influence. Evident in 5 summits between Xi and Kim in less than one year after the summit.
North Korea’s nuclear weapons development has put significant international pressure on China. China’s support for international sanctions against North Korea has multifaceted implications. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China facessubstantial international pressureto uphold global non-proliferation norms and respond to North Korea’s provocative actions. Supporting sanctions helps China maintain its image as a responsible global power.
However, China is not without bargaining chips in this scenario.  Beijing has backed UN resolutions against Pyongyang, it holds significant leverage over North Korea due to its role as the country’s primary economic and trade partner. This economic dependency gives China considerable influence over North Korea’s actions and decisions.China’s ability to provide or withhold crucial resources and supportmeans that it can exert pressure on Pyongyang when necessary, balancing its strategic interests while managing the complexities of their relationship. Consequently,China has often withheld full support for sanctions until they were diluted. This approach indicates that China’s handling of North Korea’s nuclear weapons development is driven more by strategic calculations than by genuine alliance. Revealing that their relationship is not as affectionate as it might appear.
The year 2024 marks the75th anniversary of their bilateral relationship. Kim has declared it the “year of DPRK-China friendship,” and Xi has called the year an opportunity to uphold “long-standing friendship. While outwardly cooperative, the underlying tensions and strategic manoeuvring reveal a partnership driven by necessity rather than genuine alliance.

EU Affairs: Moving Towards Green Legislation in the Austrian and European Elections of 2024,"As Austria prepared for its upcoming national elections, inquiries on the environment and methods to create common-sense legislation were everpresent. These pieces of legislation are aimed at propelling Europe and Austria towards the ambitious goals of the European Union’s Green Agenda. Simultaneously, the European election holds a profound weight to ensure that the progression forward is sustainable. The initiatives that are provided by experts in the field seek to influence political decisions and policy implementation, urging candidates to prioritize environmental sustainability in their platforms.
There currently is an abundance of information given by leading scientists who have pinpointed key sectors where legislative action could yield the most significant environmental benefits. For instance, inEarth4All, there is a strong advocacy for the energizing of the entire sector. This will craft asustainable energysource as the emissions would be net-zero. This means that renewable energy infrastructure would need to expand, creating more jobs. Next, transportation systems built on top of large carbon emissions would need to be slowly dismantled. The optimization of waste management to ensure runoff does not interrupt nor pollute the land or water tables, creating a more streamlined recyclable environment. Lastly, promoting sustainable agriculture is a necessity as the long-term utilization of land affects their yield. Turning toward indigenous techniques would allow for the ground to hold more carbon and the output to grow. In addition,if the diet of cows is augmented to be grass rather than corn, there is an illustration of how carbon emissions decrease.
Previously, Austria has taken steps to lower carbon emissions, in order to reach the goals of the European Green Deal and the climate goals of the EU. These actions include: creating a carbon tax, cap-and-trade systems, targeting both residential and commercial sectors, and developing a framework for progress in lower carbon emissions through policy. However, Austria has not been able to reduce its carbon emissions to the level that is desired according to the Austrian Climate Protection Act, even though actions are being taken to evaluate greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy adoption rate, biodiversity metrics, and other vital indicators. The scientific community can only effectively use their findings if politicians are willing to listen.
By analyzing current environmental policies adopted by the European Union and Austria, areas of improvement reveal themselves. Faults in these laws can be observed through court cases such asMüllner vs Austria, where an individual is affected by rising temperatures because of a health condition. The lack of initiative by Austria to change its actions is directly affecting marginalized individuals and groups in the country. With the standard purported by theKlimaSeniorinnencase in the European Court of Human Rights, countries can be held accountable for their inaction on the climate that negatively affects a group of people. These are gaps that must be improved. The adoption of legislation is not indicative of its implementation on the ground. As a result legal and environmental experts arescrutinizing the current regulations and laws that have been adopted by the EU.
Austrian Political Landscape
The 2024 election presents stark contrasts in environmental policies between the major political parties. The Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) has previously adopted a skeptical stance towards ambitious climate policies, where economic growth and job security are prioritized over the actual environmental regulation. As a result, their platform tends to favor traditional energy sources and is more guarded towards the EU Green Agenda as a result of its financial implications.
On the opposite end, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) supports a comprehensive climate action plan. They have advocated for large investments in renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and an expansion of the job market through green jobs. Their position and platform align more closely with the EU Green Agenda where there is an emphasis on progress. In fact, they encourage Austria to take bold steps towards reducing carbon emissions and enhancing environmental sustainability.
In the center of Austria’s political spectrum is theÖVP. Their political stance on greenhouse emissions rests in compliance with the EU’s goals of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. They advance this position by emphasizing renewable energy sources, which they use to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, they hold a strong position onthe preservation of the biodiversityof Austria and encourage sustainable forestry practices. In the past, they have faced criticism over their lack of ambition to address climate change, where they do not go far enough in their promotion of energy-efficient industries and transport.
Another party in Austria is Austria’s Green Party (the Grüne), which holds a more ambitious position on the reduction of emissions. They alsoinclude climate justicewithin their political aims. This position aims toaddress the disproportionate impacts of climate changeon vulnerable populations. Therefore, climate policies would be equitable in their introduction. Simultaneously, they strongly support international cooperation such as the strengthening of the Paris Agreement and providing funding towards developing countries for their climate transition.
Moving Forward
With the European Union Election occurring simultaneously with the Austrian election, the attention to environmental and climate challenges is emphasized heavily. Without pertinent attention,the targets for 2040 may not be advanced enough to produce effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These policies are integral for long-termfood security, people’s health preservation, pollution reduction, and temperature mitigation.
For effective common-sense legislation to come to fruition, trust between scientists and politicians must be improved to the point of being able to develop long-term action plans that can provide short-term goals. Moreover, the identification of relevant stakeholders would also need to be implemented to focus on those that will be affected sooner rather than later. Scrutinizing the massive amount of emissions that are produced by transnational corporations is an integral step in the fight toward net zero, yet getting to the point of being able to navigate the avenues to criticism is the first step that must be taken. Especially as the coming years will be integral to diverting the course of pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy turnarounds.

EU Elections. New EU citizens priorities: security and defence in the spotlight,"Europe’s defence and security has become the main concern of political parties and citizens. Source:European Defence Agency.
The latestEurobarometerplaced the European Union’s defence and security as the third priority for the European citizens (31% of people surveyed). TheEuropean Union External Actionidentifies uncountable threats for the EU in this area, such as armed conflicts and civil wars to re-emerge in the EU’s neighbourhood, cyber-attacks, hybrid threats, terrorism, disinformation, climate change, and artificial intelligence.
TheStrategic Compass of the European Unionadopted in 2022 established that the EU is surrounded by instability and conflicts and faces a war on its borders. It sets out that nowadays there is a dangerous mix of armed aggression, illegal annexation, fragile states, revisionist powers and authoritarian regimes. This environment is a seedbed for multiple threats to European security from terrorism, violent extremism and organised crime to hybrid conflicts and cyber-attacks, instrumentalisation of irregular migration, arms proliferation and the progressive weakening of the arms control architecture.
The Western Balkansregion continues to face security challenges and its stability is not a fact. It is in the particular interest of the EU to support the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the eastern neighbourhood, Ukraineis being directlyattacked by the Russian armed forces.
Moreover, the Republic of Moldova, Georgia, and other countries in the South Caucasus are facing strategic intimidations, and direct threats to their sovereignty and territorial integrity and are trapped in protracted conflicts. Belarus’s authoritarianism is manifested in its use of hybrid warfare against the EU, direct military support for Russia’s actions against Ukraine, and severe domestic repression. In the southern neighbourhood, the crises in Libya and Syria remain unresolved, with lasting and widespread regional consequences. The region is particularly threatened by terrorist movements, human trafficking and organised crime.
On the other hand, the future of Africa is also of strategic importance to the EU. Ongoing conflicts, poor governance and terrorism across the continent affect the security of the EU. This is the case in Mali, the Sahel region and Central Africa, where instability, terrorist groups, weak state structures, mercenaries and widespread poverty constitute a dangerous mix and require increased EU engagement. Stability in the Gulf of Guinea, the Horn of Africa and the Mozambique Channel remains an important security imperative for the EU.

In the Middle East and Gulf Region, addressing nuclear non-proliferation challenges in the region remains of capital importance. The region’s efforts in addressing violent extremism will also be of crucial importance for the global fight against terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and Daesh. Afghanistan continues to pose serious security challenges in terms of terrorism, drug smuggling and growing irregular migration challenges.
Furthermore, in East Asia, actors such as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) continue to threaten regional and international peace and security through weapons of mass destruction and their nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Two years after the publication of the Strategic Compass, global tensions have not abated. On the contrary, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia shows no signs of resolution, while the resurgence of the Middle East conflict between Israel and Palestine has reignited simmering tensions. The world appears more threatened than ever in recent times.
Josep Borrell was interviewed by Spanish media days before the EU elections. The High Representative pointed out that the EU’s three current challenges are the geopolitical threat, the economic-technological risks and the challenge of democratic quality. The first falls within his sphere of competence, he states that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been something of a ‘slap in the face’ for Europe. In his view, this has been an awakening. The war was a distant and distant thing that did not affect us, and suddenly some Europeans, such as the Poles or the Baltics, saw it just a few kilometres from their borders. It is therefore necessary, as part of this awakening, to address Europe’s defence capabilities.
“Everybody prefers, and so do I, to spend money on butter, as they said in the First World War:“better butter than cannons”. But sometimes, if you don’t have cannons, you also run out of butter”
Josep Borrell (HR/VP), interviewed byInformativos Telecinco(Spain) in an armaments manufacturing plant, surrounded by armoured vehicles and artillery systems. Source:Informativos Telecinco
He said that the voters would decide in the European elections which political forces would call for more integration and collaboration, and which would prefer to return to national frameworks and did not want to act together. In this respect, he said that all European countries, even the largest, are too small to play alone. Only if countries unite and share will they have the weight and size to make a difference. He concluded:“If you are not at the table, you are on the menu. And it is better to be at the table than not to be on the menu”.
Defence played an important role in the programmes of the political parties contesting the European elections. Despite the differences between the parties, there was a common denominator: peace is at risk. In this sense, the European People’s Party electoral platform includes more expansive measures in the defence sector, going so far as to propose the creation of a European army. On the other hand, the Socialists and Renew are pushing for new investments in industrial production, while the Conservatives oppose joint armed forces. The European left presented a programme against investing more in defence and proposed a reduction in the percentage of GDP devoted to defence.

The EU faces many challenges in ensuring its security and defence. But it was, undoubtedly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or the conflict in Gaza, that triggered citizens and political parties to become aware of the problem and start working to secure peace. The question is not a minor one:what formula will the EU use for this task?The proposals that politicians brought to the last European elections seem to indicate that there is fear in Europe, and in the face of fear, there is a desire for weapons. But, is another Europe possible? More diplomacy and fewer weapons?Or, perhapsMacronwas right when he stated, “We have undoubtedly been too hesitant by defining the limits of our action to someone who no longer has any and who is the aggressor.”","June 21, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/eu-elections-new-eu-citizens-priorities-security-and-defence-in-the-spotlight/,María Vallés González,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
EU Elections: Political divide with EU Farmers and Green Deal,"TheEuropean farmers’ protestsare demonstrations led by farmers all over Europe in response to the policies put forward by theEuropean Green Deal. Starting in December 2023 until now, the most recent protests occurring a week before the European elections, these demonstrations have criticizedlow food prices, carbon taxes, pesticide bans, and trade with non-EU countries, amongst other issues.
The first country to protest was France, which initiated the movement in October 2023 in Occitania. In January 2024, they started a road blockade that lasted until Prime Gabriel Attal conceded to some of their demands in February 2024. Germany, Poland, and the Netherlands have also suffered different waves of demonstrations concerning subsidies for diesel, the use of nitrogen, or the importation of Ukrainian grain. The particular case of the Netherlands has led to the creation of the Farmer-Citizen Movement, a party that has achieved representation in Dutch political organizations.
Thelast wave of protestswas organized on June 3, by Spanish and French farmers, with the clear objective of influencing the outcome of the EU elections. On both sides, the border that separates both countries was blocked, and the protesters showed support for local production, tax breaks on energy, and preference for EU products.
These protests have displayed controversies around the European Green Deal, showing the deep divide and complex intersection between ideology, identity, and economic interests. A significant aspect to consider  is the broader context of global trade and economic pressures. Farmers argue that European policies are placing them at a disadvantage compared to international competitors who do not face the same stringent environmental regulations.
For instance, imported agricultural products from countries outside the EU often come from regions with less strict environmental laws, leading to lower production costs. This discrepancy creates a market imbalance, making it harder for European farmers to compete. The protestors have highlighted that without adequate protection and support, the local agricultural sector might face decline, risking food security and the livelihoods of countless farmers. Moreover, these protests underscore the need for fair trade policies that ensure imported goods meet the same environmental standards as those required within the EU. This perspective adds another layer of complexity to the debate, emphasizing the interconnectedness of local, national, and global agricultural policies.
For this article, we present an analysis on three levels, focusing mainly on the political aspect that can hepl understanding the impact of these protests in the EU elections:
Evidently, the political spectrum also has a wide range of grey areas, and there have been circumstances in which right-wing parties have supported green initiatives if they aligned with national interest and left-wing parties rejected other initiatives if they favored big corporations.

At this point, it appears that the European Green Deal cannot be a “one-size-fits-all”. The farmers’ protests have showcased the already evident political polarization that the European Union is going through. In this context, the left-right divide is exacerbated by the sub-levels of urban vs. rural and supranational vs. national. Additionally, in the recent aftermath of the EU elections, we can foresee a deeper divide than previously. Even though the current status quo can be maintained thanks to the seats obtained by EPP, S&D and Renew Europe, a small but clear shift towards the right of the political spectrum has been clearly identified, with ECR winning over 14 seats and the Greens losing roughly 17 seats, compared to pevious elections. This new panorama raisesconcernsabut the “ambition” of the climate and green initiatives over the next mandate.
Addressing this requires an approach that balances out inclusivity, economic support, and education. In the aftermath of the European elections, with a small majority of pro-European parties formed by EPP, SPD, and RenewEurope, possible recommendations on this matter going forward could include:","July 01, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/eu-elections-political-divide-with-eu-farmers-and-green-deal/,Aralda Torres,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
EU Elections: The Role of Immigration Politics in the Elections,"The European Union (EU) elections have come and gone this past June 6th-9th, with a widely anticipated shift to the political rightmaterializing. The results of this rightward shift will have a dramatic impact in the years to come on the individual member states of the EU itself, as well as the broader European continent; therefore, it is imperative to critically engage with one of the most discussed about issues in the lead up to the election and analyze its impact – that beingimmigration.
EU centrist and center leaning parties sought to stave off support for the far-right by passing a stricterimmigration and asylum pact, ultimately appearing to concede the framing of the immigration debate to the far-right in what has been viewed as afutile and recklesseffort. Even in the years preceding these most recent EU elections, this phenomenon of the far-right being able to exert pressure on mainstream EU politics — as centrist and center leaning parties continually adopted further rightwing positions and policies on immigration in particular – waswell established. This shift to the right by the center came despite polling indicating that immigration was a concern, butnot the top priorityfor EU voters, with the very same polling showing that the cost of living was in fact the number one concern. How then can one make sense of this shift to the right by the center, as well as the surge insupport for the far-rightin the two largest EU member states of France and Germany, if EU voters overall did not view immigration as a top concern?
It is undeniable that one of the most shocking results of the EU elections were theunprecedented gainsmade by Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (RN) in France – receiving 31.37% of the vote, well ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance with 14.6% in second place. Ahead of the EU elections, RN made sure that immigration was at the center of theirplatform; furthermore, President Macron had – in the same vein of other EU centrist and centrist leaning figures – passed afar-right influenced billon immigration in France prior to the EU elections. Despite President Macroninsistingthat he had, “not betrayed voters who rallied behind [him] to stop the far right,” his very own immigration bill was endorsed by the far-right — with Le Penclaiming, “ideological victory.” However, the basis for RN’s victory in France may not lie entirely in immigration politics, as evidence by President Macron’s failed efforts to stave off -far-right support by passing stricter immigration legislation; in fact, it would appear that – similar to the EU overall – French voters foundcost of livingto beat out immigration to be their top priority. Now, with President Macron having called forsnap parliamentary electionsin France after RN’s victory in the EU elections, the reality of President Macron’sunpopularityis apparent with another projectedelection losson the horizon for the embattled French President.
Arguably just as stunning as the results out of France, Germany likewise saw ashift to the rightas a result of the EU elections, with the center-right Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands (CDU) and far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AFD) in first and second respectively with 30% and 15.9%. While a center leaning party was able to come out on top in Germany, the surge in support for the AFD and collapse in support for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ center-left Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) –coming in thirdwith 13.9% — has led to ashockwithin German politics. The similarities between France and Germany do not stop there though, with the AFD, much like the RN, heavily promoting a stricter, far-right vision for immigration policies – having incited controversy late last year when it was discovered thatmembers of the AFD met with other far-right and extremist figuresto discuss the mass deportation of immigrants and “non-assimilated” Germans termed as “remigration.” Furthermore, Chancellor Scholz seemingly followed in President Macron’s footsteps in seeking to stymie far-right support bypromotingstricter immigration policies as well – despite German voters holding bothpeace and social securityas their to priorities; however, much like President Macron, these efforts by the center to outflank the far-right on immigration have seemingly failed, with Chancellor Scholz and his coalition government asunpopularas ever as well. The only difference in this case being that Chancellor Scholz hasruled outsnap elections. This presents a peculiar picture though, one in which EU voters have clearly indicated that the cost of living is their top priority, only for the incumbent political center to instead seek to outflank the far-right on immigration — something that has been established to be both futile and reckless.
To complicate matters even further, outside and France and Germany, the concession of the framing of the immigration debate to the far-right appears even more counterintuitive. It is true that Giorgia Meloni’s far-right Fratelli d’Italia (FDI) did indeed come infirst in Italythis past EU elections with 28% of the vote, and that FDI has a similar vision to immigration of that of RN and the AFD – having passed a bill tosend immigrants to Albaniarecently; however, that is not the complete story of Italy’s EU elections. Just behind in second place though was Elly Schlein’s center-left Partito Democratico (PD) with 24% of the vote – the party’sfirst EU elections under Schlein, and a healthy turnaround from PD’s last EU election showing of 19%. Despite not coming in first, the strong showing for PD who openly promoted a campaigncounter to that of the rightunder a leader viewed asleftwing, further punctures the methodology of centrist actors seeking to outflank the far-right on immigration. In addition to the turnaround of PD in Italy, theNordic countries saw a rejection of the center and far-rightacross Denmark, Sweden, and Finland in favor of left and even far-left candidates and parties. Danish media in particular interpreted the results in Denmark as arebuke against the incumbent centrist governmentof Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen; something both President Macron and Chancellor Scholz can seemingly relate with.
There will be a lot made of the role of immigration politics and rhetoric in these most recent EU elections, but that role is not entirely what it seems to be. The impact of such discourse and policies of course must not be ignored – with Vincent Cochetel, the UN refugee agency’s special envoy for the central and western Mediterranean,warning of the dangerssuch anti-immigrant discourse could have on influencing global politics ahead of the EU elections, in addition to the aforementioned far-right parties of RN, AFD, and FDI having all already clearly influenced or passedanti-immigrant legislation. However, the stinging losses suffered by incumbent centrists, the resurgence of the left in some areas, and polling showing that EU voters’ primary concern is the cost of living rather articulates a frustration towards incumbent politics and a lack of addressing the primary economic concern more than it alludes to a voter preference for far-right policies on immigration.

(Analysis) Colombia’s Diplomatic Breakup with Israel: Analyzing the Fallout and Latin America’s Stance on the Gaza Conflict,"On May 1st, during the International Workers’ Day rally at Bolívar’s Square, Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced the cessation of diplomatic relations with Israel due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Palestine.
(HI! ONE LAST EDIT, COULD YOU PLEASE MOVE THE HYPERLINK OVER THIS PHRASE TO ONLY COVER THE PORTION I BOLDED IN IT? THANK YOU!)
This announcement was soon confirmed by the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs witha statementemphasizing that “this decision is solely about breaking diplomatic relations and is not against the Israeli people or Jewish communities, with whom we share enduring historical and friendly ties.”
State of Colombia to sever ties with Israel.""Tomorrow diplomatic relations will be broken with Israel due to having a genocidal president,"" Gustavo Petro, President of Colombia says.Israel becoming a pariah state.pic.twitter.com/OpouJ82g9Q
The relationship between Colombia and Israel dates back to around 1947 when Colombia abstained from voting during the UN General Assembly’s resolution to address the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, which ultimately led to the creation of the State of Israel.Colombia officially recognized Israel in February 1949, and diplomatic relations were formally established on October 1, 1957, resulting in the opening of embassies in Tel Aviv and Bogotá. This marked the beginning of a stable economic and military support relationship between the two nations, which continued until around 2022 when Gustavo Petro took office.
From the late 1980s onward,Colombia acquired Israeli Kfir fighter jets, deploying them against guerrilla camps. This initiated a prolonged era of military cooperation, as Colombia continued to invest in Israeli-made warplanes and weapons to combat drug cartels and guerillas. Throughout this time Colombia actively engaged with Israel’s military,participating in training programsfocused on what the Colombian state termed “counter-terrorism and combat techniques.”
However, the economic ties between the two nations extend beyond the realm of military goods. In 2014 a free trade agreement (FTA) was signed between Colombia and Israel, which came into effect on August 11, 2020.Today, Israel purchases approximately 1% of Colombia’s total exports,encompassing commodities such as coal, coffee, and flowers.Conversely, Colombia imports various products from Israel,including electrical equipment, plastics, and fertilizers. These trade dynamics represent only a fraction of the broader economic exchange between them. In addition, over the past 24 years, the two nations have cultivated a remarkable partnership through theMashav program. According toMarcos Peckel,recent governments under Álvaro Uribe, Juan Manuel Santos, and Iván Duque have shown a tendency to align more closely with Israel.
Nevertheless, the Colombian government over the decades has aimed to maintain a historical balance between Israeli and Arab nations. Santos’s administrationrecognized Palestine as a state in 2018,a decision upheld by Duque’s government, whichdeclaredthat“the decision made by his predecessor Juan Manuel Santos to recognize Palestine as a free and sovereign state is irreversible.” These actions were met with surprise and disappointment by the Israeli government, whichviewed them as a slap in the face from a loyal friend.
In recent months, following the intensification of the historic conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and under the new administration of President Gustavo Petro, bilateral relations between Colombia and Israel have started to waver. This decline has been exacerbated as a result of the October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Palestine.  Petro’s constant statements against Israel’s military actions in Gaza have been similarly inflammatory.
The Colombian government has consistently maintained a firm position on the Israel-Palestine conflict, calling for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and humanitarian aid for Gaza in response to Israel’s military operations there. Colombia argues that Israel’s actions have disregarded fundamental principles of international humanitarian law such as distinction, proportionality, and precaution. Despite Colombia’s advocacy, severe humanitarian crises, including famine, infrastructure destruction, and civilian casualties, persist in Gaza, reinforcing Colombia’s belief that Israel’s conduct does not meet international standards.
Colombia has pushed for a Peace Conference to address the conflict and supports a two-state solution based on the UN’s 1967 borders. Valuing negotiation and dialogue for conflict resolution,Colombia has also taken its stance to international forums and the International Court of Justice (ICJ).In early April this year, the Colombian government requested to join anICJ case filed by South Africaaccusing Israel of genocide, aiming to protect vulnerable populations in Gaza.

As tensions grew and accusations from the Israeli government mounted, President Gustavo Petro announced on May 2 that Colombia would sever diplomatic relations with Israel. Petro, a leading figure inLatin America’s “pink tide” progressive wave, has been avocal criticof Israel since the onset of the Gaza war.The Foreign Ministry statementemphasized that this decision targets diplomatic relations, not the Israeli people or Jewish communities. Colombia remains committed to peace and a two-state solution, with President Petro unequivocally stating,“Colombia does not support genocides. Period.”
On June 8th, President Petro announced via social media that Colombiawould suspend coal exportsto Israel through a decree until what he termed as “the genocide” in Gaza stops. The decree, effective five days after publication, suspends the export of coal and briquettes until Israel complies with provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice to cease military operations in Rafah.
Israel hassuspended security exportsto Colombia following President Petro’s constant criticisms and statements, which have not been well-received by Israel. Members of the Israeli government and the Knesset have condemned and responded to Petro’s remarks. Petro accused Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of using language reminiscent of“Nazi rhetoric towards Jews”,following Gallant’s statement that Israel was combating “human animals” in Gaza while ordering a total siege of the territory after deadly attacks on southern Israel on October 7th. In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Israel Katz retaliated by labeling the leftist leader as“antisemitic and full of hatred.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also responded to President Petro’s statements via social media, reiterating the terrorist nature of Hamas and condemning the October 7th attack. Netanyahu directed a strong rebuke at the Colombian leader, stating, “Shame on you, Petro!”

Meanwhile in Latin America, responsesto the Israel-Palestine/Gaza conflict have varied widelyamong different countries, reflecting diverse geopolitical considerations and domestic factors. Historically,left-leaning countries in Latin America have tended to sympathize with the Palestinian cause, while right-wing nations often align closely with the United States,turning the Israel-Palestine issue into a proxy for their foreign relations.
Bolivia, under PresidentLuis Arce,severed diplomatic relations with Israel and referred the situation to the International Criminal Court, framing its actions as a response to perceived violations of international law and human rights.Belizealso cut ties with Israel, whileHondurasrecalled its ambassador in solidarity with Palestinians, particularly after the bombing of a Jabalia refugee camp.Chile, home to a significant Palestinian community, saw President Gabriel Boric condemn Israel’s actions as collectivepunishmentand the Senate ban imports from Israeli settlements, sparking criticism from the United States.
Argentina presents a contrasting case with its newly elected president,Javier Milei, who has shownstrong support for Israel. Milei has pledged to move Argentina’s embassy to Jerusalem and emphasized Israel’s right to self-defense, marking a significant shift from the previous administration underAlberto Fernández, which condemned violations by both Hamas and Israel. Brazil’s PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvadescribed Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide and supported a UN Security Council ceasefire resolution, illustratingBrazil’s vocal opposition. Conversely,El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukelealigned with the United States in supporting Israel and condemning Hamas, despite his Palestinian ancestry.
Mexicoadvocated for a political solution respecting both Israel’s security and Palestinian statehood, calling for ahumanitarian ceasefire.Perucondemned Israel’s conduct and emphasized a two-state solution.Caribbean nationscalled for an end to violence,urging compliance with UN resolutions.Nicaragua,Venezuela, andCubadiverged by either justifying or not condemning Hamas, with leaders like Daniel Ortega andNicolás Maduroexpressing solidarity with the Palestinian cause and blaming long-standing Israeli policies for the conflict.
The way Latin American nations have responded highlights the complex interplay of historical alliances, internal demographics, and geopolitical considerations shaping each country’s stance on the Israel-Palestine/Gaza conflict. While some have condemned Israel’s military actions and taken diplomatic steps in protest, others have pursued a more balanced approach, weighing Israel’s security concerns against calls for Palestinian rights and advocating for a negotiated peace settlement.
Colombia’s decision to sever diplomatic ties with Israel marks a pivotal moment in its foreign policy, reflecting a strong stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict that could reshape its international relationships and domestic politics. This move, led by President Gustavo Petro, underscores the complex dynamics at play in Latin America. As Latin America navigates these intricate waters, Colombia’s bold step sets a precedent that may influence regional and global diplomatic landscapes.

Reform or Facade? Pezeshkian’s Challenges in Transforming Iran,"On May 19th, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials tragically lost their lives in ahelicopter crash. Iran subsequently held snap presidential elections, which, after the second round of voting on the 5th of July, resulted in the election of reformist Masoud Pezeshkian. The newly-elected president leads the Islamic Republic of Iran, a nation contested by its population, burdened by sanctions, and drowning in aplummeting economy.
Of the 61 million Iranians called to the polls, Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes against over 13 million for his opponent, the ultra-conservative Saeed Jalili, out of 30 million ballots already counted, according to electoral authorities. After a first-round marked by a strong abstention, participation stood at 49.8%.
The Guardian Councilselects all presidential candidates based on various criteria, such as education, commitment to Islam, and the values of the Islamic Republic. They orchestrate the elections, deciding who gets to the forefront and who is removed. Considering this, the extent to which Pezeshkian is a genuine reformist able to bring significant changes to the country remains questionable.
“I didn’t know the candidates’ names, and I didn’t want to know. It is all a game. We vote for one only because we don’t want to vote for the other. Why should I vote when I cannot decide for my life? I was once arrested because I wasn’t wearing a hijab, they then went to my parents’ home and destroyed everything.” As an internationally renowned Iranian athlete, X (her identity is confidential for security reasons) had to wear her hijab even outside Iranian territory. She and many other Iranians don’t believe in change and consider the reformist a façade. “They have another Islam, another God. It is not Islam in the Quran. I really want to get back to my country, but I have no place there,” she continues.
What makes the Islamic Republic a curious case study, like any ideological authoritarian regime, is its evolution. Religion is an instrument benefiting the powerful whilst the people suffer. The first round of voting on June 28th experienced thelowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republicsince the Islamic Revolution of 1979. More than political fatigue, there is genuine disgust.
Young graduates, women, and citizens the current regime removed and have launched a movement toboycott the elections. Voting is no longer a sign of change for them. The hashtag #ElectionCircus is currently trending on social media, showing the population’s disenchantment.
The economic situation in Iran is beyond critical. The inflation rate stands at 50% and there is a significant loss in the value of the Iranian currency. The rift between the Islamic Republic and the population grows, with more than half of the population living below the poverty line and a rising unemployment rate, especially among young graduates.
Accompanying the economic crisis are restrictions on rights, with women who do not comply with the mandatory hijab rule facing punishments such as fines. Another woman who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons stated that the government took her car because they caught her driving without a hijab, and remains without it to this day. Even taxi drivers and restaurant managers ask women to wear a headscarf because they fear losing their jobs.
Additionally, political prisoners are conditionally released from prison in exchange for large sums of money. In his campaign, Pezeshkian addressed the issue of mandatory hijab for women, one of the causes of the widespread protest movement that shook the country in late 2022 following the death ofMahsa Amini, who was arrested for not adhering to the strict dress code.
Under the slogan “For Iran”, Pezeshkian promised to be a voice of the voiceless, to promote human rights, and find solutions to the economic disaster. He also wants greater cooperation with the West in an effort to lift sanctions which have not only crippled the economy, but have limited access to essential goods, medicines, and services, further straining the lives of ordinary Iranians. These sanctions target key sectors, including oil, banking, and trade, aiming to curb Iran’s nuclear program and reduce its influence in the region. Not only have they isolated Iran economically but also politically, exacerbating internal strife and pushing the country into a precarious position on the global stage.
The International Scene
Internationally, Iran remains a contentious player. Its support forproxy groupsin the Middle East, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, its ballistic missile program, and its nuclear ambitions have drawn criticism and concern from the international community. Efforts to revive the nuclear deal have been ongoing, with various diplomatic engagements, but progress is slow and fraught with difficulties. The negotiations, specifically with the U.S., could become more hostile if Donald Trump returns to the White House this November.
The European Union has attempted to maintain a balancing act, advocating for diplomatic solutions while condemning Iran’s human rights abuses and regional activities. Countries like China and Russia, however, have continued to engage with Iran, providing a level of economic relief and political support.
The path ahead
Pezeshkian becoming president could offer some hope for the country, with the potential for better communication with the West, improvements in human rights in the context of harsh gender apartheid policies, and efforts to enhance the economy and ease sanctions. However, his power will be limited. Ultimately, the authority rests with the Supreme Leader and head of state, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. If Pezeshkian remains true to his words, the fight will be tough and the road long, but change could eventually emerge.
Will Pezeshkian be able to navigate these challenges and bring about the desired reforms?

China’s Foothold in Peru’s Strategic Port Infrastructures,"Peru’s maritime trade has expanded considerably in recent history, in part due to asupportive legislationallowing the country to attract foreign investments. From this, the development of key infrastructure finds itself in the eye of the storm. Multi-billion dollars investments byChinese state-owned Cosco Shipping Portsfunded the construction of a colossal port near Lima, the first under Chinese control in South America. And inMarch this year, another Chinese firm called Jinzhao obtained an additional port construction contract.
Such fruitful relations between Peru and China are the byproduct of strong diplomatic and trade ties. In Chinese rhetoric, infrastructure investments within the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at expanding global influence, offer win-win solutions. They directly respond to modernisation needs and improve internal trade routes.
On the other hand, the investments serve China’s interest in ensuring its access to key raw materials and agricultural markets. Nevertheless, such win-win solutions bring along diverse challenges and risks, which could, under different perspectives, undermine a country’s national security, especially when it comes to strategic infrastructures such as ports.
Peru’s Port System and the Case of Chancay
In South America, Peru stands out as akey player in maritime trade. The country saw a steady growth in the last decade with 57% in 2020 compared to 2010. Peru’s current legislation establishes that port ownership can be public or private, and by 2020, there were29 public ports and 58 private ones. The former are normally multi-purpose, whereas the latter tend to be more specialised regarding the type of operations they perform.
The port of Chancay is an example of aprivate multi-purpose port70km away from Lima. Chancay should be inaugurated by November this year during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Chinese state-owned Cosco Shipping Ports is the main beneficiary of the contract signed for its construction. The urgency todecongest other ports and ensure an efficient performanceby the maritime trade sector in Peru are undoubtedly some of the reasons behind this project.
Chancay is expected to become a crucial maritime hub for Asia-Pacific trade exchanges, reducing shipping time and, more generally, the time-to-market indicator for the goods exchanged. Until now, most transportations from South America to China had to first stop in North or Central America and before entering the Pacific. Being one of the few deep water ports in Peru, Chancay will host some of the largest existing cargoes. This has resulted in interest from other South American countries, especiallyBrazil, whose Planning Minister visited the infrastructure in March 2024 to sound the possibility of integrating trade routes.
Brazil is the one of the main exporters of soy and corn to China, but it faces long shipping time due to the forced passage through the Panama Canal. Nevertheless, there are doubts around thecomparative advantagesthat Brazil and other states such as Ecuador and Chile would have in using Chancay compared to usual routes. The new route could result in longer distances or using underdeveloped infrastructures, which would mean higher transport prices.
The Peruvian government has presented Chancay as an highly strategic piece of infrastructure for the country, which will have the power to change the regional trade routes, turning Peru into a trade hub. Among expectedbenefits, there is a considerable stimulus for industrialisation, the improvement of other inland trade routes and a growing demand for high-skilled jobs. The significantreduction of 15 days of the shipping timefrom South America to China and South-East Asia countries should also help boost Peruvianagricultural exports, providing the conditions for a better preservation of such goods during transportation.
Yet, not all that glitters is gold. Between March and April 2024, there was a serious impasse between Peru’s National Port Authority and Cosco Shipping. The contract signed in 2021 included anexclusivity clause, which establishes that Cosco, as constructor and administrator of the port, would also be the exclusive operator in the delivery of port services. As such, Cosco Shipping holds amonopolyover the port.
In March, Peru’s National Port Authority filed forannulment of the contract signed in 2021, because it apparently didn’t have the authority to provide Cosco with the exclusivity clause. This provoked a backlash from Cosco, which drew attention to potential consequences on the finalisation of the port. The solution came not only from the juridical system, but also from politics.
On the one hand, the judgerejectedthe National Port Authority demand for annulment due to non-fulfilment of admission requirements and to the ongoing amendments within the national legislation. But congress amended the national legislation to clarify the provisions regarding private ports. The amendment establishes that in the case of the issuance of port permits, the National Port Authority must immediately grant permit holders theexclusivityover the delivery of essential port services.
China-Peru Relations: a Regional Opportunity or a Threat to National Security?
Chinese investments in the port of Chancay reflect a wider and longer cooperation framework between Peru and China, which was sealed in the form of a Free Trade Agreement in 2008. The port is one of the largest Chinese investments in Latin America under theBelt and Road Initiative. Under this and other projects, China intends to gain access to raw materials and agricultural commodities markets, expand its diplomatic and political ties, and expand influence in the region. In doing so, it has offeredconcrete responsesto Peruvian domestic development strategies, in a complex context of modest economic recovery and rising poverty rates.
The Peruvian government’s capacity to comply with its commitment to investing in secondary infrastructures connecting the port to other cities and facilities in the mid- to long-term will be the main variable for the port’s success and performance in the future. The government is working to make Chancay Port aSpecial Economic Zone (SEZ), but investments to improve the hinterland and the railways and roads leading to it will be essential to fully exploit Chancay’s benefits.
Preoccupations around a Chinese port and its related security threats have been spreading in the United States.A US high officer commentedthat the Peruvian government has failed to put the country’s national security in the foreground for Chancay and other instances. Chinese state-owned firms have purchased majority stakes in power distribution in Lima and mining industries throughout the country. In addition, the US sees the Chancay port as a potentially strategic infrastructure which would serve China’smilitary purposes.
The Peruvian government has defended its own decisions to bring forward cooperation with China on diverse fronts, and the recentvisit of Peruvian President Dina Boluarte in Chinais a testimony of this intention. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm and expectations that megaprojects such as Chancay may produce, the transparency of the process and the economic and socio-environmental sustainability of such projects remain themain hurdles to overcomeand to make such projects successful on all sides. In the meantime, Peru has awarded the construction of a new port in the Southern region of Ica. A subsidiary ofChinese firm Jinzhao won the tender and received a 30-year concessionfor its construction and operation. The port’s activities will focus on raw materials, especially copper and iron concentrate, considering its proximity to local mining sites.

A Crossing of Two Hands? The European Youth and The EU Bubble,"By Paulina Ríos Maya and Liz Morán
The European Union (EU) represents one of the most ambitious political and economic projects of modern history, uniting a diverse array of nations under a common framework aimed at ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity.
The “EU bubble,” a term often used to describe the concentrated hub of policymakers, institutions, and lobbyists based primarily in Brussels, successfully attracts a flock of youth every year to the heart of Europe. The expertise concentrated in this bubble enables it to address complex transnational challenges, promote economic integration, and ensure the smooth functioning of the single market. This centralised approach is crucial for coordinating efforts across member states, maintaining the stability and coherence of the Union, and advancing the overarching goals of the EU.
This special issue explores the dynamic and sometimes fraught relationship between the European youth and the EU bubble, examining how this relationship shapes the future of the European project.
The EU bubble refers to the densely populated area in Brussels where the EU’s key institutions, including the European Commission, European Parliament, and Council of the European Union are located. It is characterised by a high concentration of policymakers, diplomats, lobbyists, NGOs, and EU-oriented media outlets. The term also reflects the insular nature of this community, where professionals are often deeply immersed in the intricacies of EU affairs.
In addition to the official institutions, the EU Bubble is also home to numerous additional organisations that influence and support the policy-making process. These include think tanks, consultancies, law firms, and various interest groups. The presence of these entities creates a dynamic ecosystem where information exchange, negotiation, and advocacy are constant. This enclave, however, is not only a geographical entity but also a metaphorical space where European politics, policymaking, and administration converge, and where decisions affecting over 500 million people are debated and elaborated. Overall, it is fair to say that the so-called “EU bubble” is a microcosm of European governance, reflecting both the complexity and the collaborative spirit of the EU.
TNGO Asks: Is there such a thing as the “EU Bubble”? What characterises it?
Eduvigis Sardà:There is inevitably a European bubble, given how all relations are in the working environment. Intensive days, workshops, and other events leave everyone involved in the EU without much time to explore and get to know anything out of it. It is characterised by a kind of social isolation that usually creates difficulties for EU bubble natives to connect to the dilemmas and problems experienced daily by EU citizens. There is a disconnect between the topics popular in the bubble and the ones that actually cause concern among citizens.
Communications officer (anonymous):Absolutely yes. The EU bubble is extremely obvious, even though from the member states we do not realise the magnitude. It is not only in Brussels but also in Strasbourg and Luxembourg. Makes sense, though, as it is where the EU institutions are.
In addition to the geographical concentration, there is also the multiculturality: we are in the capital of Belgium, and I hear more English and Italian in the streets than French or Dutch. People are living and working in the EU Bubble and don’t even speak French, which makes it difficult to adapt and interact with the Brussels locals (who are an endangered species).
If you work for the EU institutions (a bubble within the bubble), especially the European Parliament (the bubble within the bubble within the bubble, the inception bubble) and you manage your time well, you can jump from policy event to policy event and not have to buy breakfast, lunch, or dinner for weeks.
The perception of the EU bubble is double-edged. On one hand, it is seen as an efficient hub for managing the complex affairs of a diverse Union of 27 Member States. On the other hand, it can be attached to negative connotations due to its perceived detachment from ordinary citizens.
TNGO asks: Is there such a thing as the “EU Bubble”? What characterises it?
Alessandra Cardaci:Yes, the so-called “EU bubble” exists and it refers to the complex network of mostly Brussels-based policymakers, lobbyists from the NGO and private sectors, journalists, and experts/researchers who are deeply engaged in EU affairs. The perception around this bubble is that is quite self-referential and detached from the broader public, which is often testified by the jargon and acronym-heavy discussions, and the high level of expertise and fine networking skills required to be part of it.
Personally, I do not like to refer to it as the “EU bubble” as this term perpetuates a negative connotation around EU affairs and policy-making, projecting an image of the EU that goes against its own popular motto “united in diversity” and the many great achievements we have collected as a Union.
Anna Hackett:I think it is fair to say that an EU bubble does exist. In the simplest of terms, it is characterised by those who have a pulse on what is going on within the EU institutions and are either working directly for one of the institutions or are employed in a position for which the work of the institutions is relevant.
This ranges from what one could call top-level EU officials, to lobbyists, assistants, contract agents, workers of EU-adjacent NGOs and think tanks, and trainees. Just like in other ‘industries’, one characteristic of the bubble is an understanding of EU terminology beyond the names and terms that most of the general public would know. Geographically, the European Quarter in Brussels is the base of the bubble but also very much included are those based in the smaller ‘EU air bubbles’ found in Strasbourg, Luxembourg, and the various Parliament Liaison, Commission Representation, and European Movement offices across and outside of the EU.
Although pursuing a career in Brussels seems a popular option among the European youth, breaking through the EU bubble job market remains quite challenging for young professionals. Indeed, often, interns are underpaid and are caught in a cycle of successive internships without substantial career advancement.
From our expert interviews, we gathered information highlighting the challenges young professionals face in breaking through the EU Bubble, often perceived as an isolationist and elitist enclave, a perception particularly daunting for newcomers who aspire to make their mark within this highly specialised and insular community.
TNGO asks: Have you found any difficulties in accessing the job market in Brussels?
AsNathan Canas, energy and environment reporter trainee at Euractiv, explained in conversation with TNGO, “after two internships in France, I was able to find an internship in Brussels, which was a huge breakthrough to enter the Brussels job market because even though I had two internships under my belt, I did not have experience in EU affairs aside from my master’s degree in European policy. I arrived in Brussels at the end of August and was only able to find an internship by October after around 50 applications. It was a really long and stressful process. People now have more than one master and the job market is increasingly competitive. If you do not have your parent’s networks, is almost impossible.”
Ananonymous communications officer interviewed for this article, moved to Brussels to pursue a romantic relationship. As she explains, soon she realised that“[out] of love, I can’t eat.” She recalled experiencing “some difficulties finding a job in sexy topics but when I gave up on that, I found interesting internships in not-so-sexy topics.” The communications officer explained that as far as she was concerned,“it is easier to enter consultancies because they have much more turnover.”
ForEduvigis Sardà, a former trainee at Culture Action Europe, the job market in Brussels“is a very competitive market in which more than half of job opportunities are internships, so you do not really get to work in the system until you are a certain age. It is very difficult to meet these opportunities without the relevant economic basis.”
Despite numerous initiatives aimed at involving the youth in EU affairs, the reality for many young professionals who aim to break through their careers in the bubble sometimes is rather bleak. Internships, frequently seen as the primary entry point into EU institutions and related organisations, are often low-paid. This financial strain can be a significant barrier, particularly for those who do not have additional means of support.
Often, however, the difficulty lies not only in breaking through but also in securing job stability. In this sense, another critical issue the youth faces is therevolving doorof internships, with many young professionals moving from one short-term position to another with little opportunity for stable, long-term employment. This constant churn can be demoralising and exhausting, as it often involves continuous job searching, application processes, and the uncertainty of securing the next role. Indeed, the competitive nature of these internships means that only a few manage to secure positions that lead to permanent roles. As selection processes are often rigorous due to the extensive pool of young and often overqualified graduates, it is not uncommon that candidates with prior experience or connections within the bubble are favoured, further perpetuating the cycle of exclusivity and making it difficult for new entrants to break through.
Astudyconducted in Brussels by Anna Simola found the job market in this city was a highly competitive one where young workers faced considerable challenges. Simola interviewed 27 university-educated young Europeans (ages 21 to 34) from Italy, Spain, Finland, and Denmark who had moved to Brussels to work but had subsequently experienced unemployment at some point during their stay. In her study, Simola found that “[f]or the vast majority of them, a wish to pursue an international or EU career was an important motivating factor to move to Brussels along with other factors such as a lack of job opportunities corresponding to their qualifications and poor working conditions in their countries of origin. While living in Brussels, they had all been engaged in different kinds of precarious work arrangements, such as a series of short-term contracts and internships, false self-employment, temporary agency work, casual work, and informal work. […] None of the participants were ‘non-active’ in the sense that, even when not employed, they were all engaged in paid or unpaid internships and other forms of unremunerated work and training, while actively, often feverishly, searching for paid employment.”In one instance, she uses the example of “Carlos”, who had left his job in Spain and moved to Brussels because his dream was to work in European affairs. However, as he urgently needed access to healthcare, he accepted work as a school assistant to obtain a registration certificate.
The precarity, however, might also haunt those who manage to enter the ranks of the EU’s institutions. As Gregorio Sorgi, Federica Di Sario, and Lucia Mackenzie write forPolitico, “[t]he first step into EU employment consists of a time-bound contract —known as an intérimaire in EU jargon— that the employer can easily bring to an end.” A eurocrat interviewed for the piece, described the path as “soul-crushing,” explaining officials are employed in a precarious position where their contract is extended monthly, or even weekly. Sorgi, Di Sario, and Mackenzie continue:“[e]ven the ones who do stick around tend to be awarded unstable jobs. Joining the ranks of the ever-expanding contract agent staff, a transitory role that counts 8,000 officials […] is considered the first step to becoming a Eurocrat. But even that expires after six years, meaning officials would then either have to leave the Commission or start from scratch in another agency if they don’t pass the “concours” by that time. And it often means the exit door for many young people who’ve lost hope of winning a more permanent post.”
Needless to say, young professionals entering the EU bubble also encounter a steep learning curve as the environment is saturated with complex EU policies and legislation. The specialised knowledge and jargon prevalent in this community can be intimidating, making it difficult for those new to the field to engage confidently and meaningfully.
Worth mentioning, is that social dynamics within the EU bubble further exacerbate these challenges. The concentration of international employees and expatriates fosters a community where professional and social interactions are closely intertwined. “All relations revolve around the working environment. Intensive days, workshops, and other events leave everyone involved in the EU without much time to explore and get to know anything out of it,” explains Sardà, shedding light on an idea that once appeared in aPoliticoarticle: “[a]s the home of the EU institutions and a lot of lobbyists, Brussels’ social life revolves around one main activity: networking. This applies to both professional life and personal life —which can, at times, overlap (it’s a small world).”
For young professionals, gaining access to these networks can be particularly challenging, as many key connections and opportunities are facilitated through established relationships and exclusive social circles. This can create a sense of elitism, where young newcomers struggle to find their footing and make the necessary connections to advance their careers.
Where Is the Youth?
For now, it is clear that the youth is attracted to the EU Bubble, but is the sentiment unidirectional? “Brussels is no city for young officials. The European Quarter is filled with gray-haired Brussels lifers who know the corridors of powers like the backs of their (wrinkled) hands,”wroteSorgi, Di Sario, and Mackenzie. For the past 12 years, the proportion of people under 40 working in the European Commission’s administrator employee class has shrunk drastically while the share of people over 50 has increased, they explained. The bubble’s increasing age was already highlighted in a piece by the same media outlet in 2021. After analysing a unique dataset on the educational background of more than 600 EU bubblers and MEPs,Politicohad already revealed then that the average senior EU official is a 57-year-old man with at least two degrees, one of them in law. Moreover, the media outlet concluded that to make it in the EU institutions, you need at least one degree —“preferably two or three, with none of the senior officials skipping university.“In fact, the analysis showed that EU officials with a bachelor’s degree only are the minority, as most hold at least a master’s —with the European Commission having the largest share of PhDs.
Overall, asaspiring Eurocrats put it, “Eurocrats are the lifeblood of the EU institutions, drafting key reforms on issues such as climate change and digital regulation that overwhelmingly affect younger generations across member countries. It is not right for these choices to fall down only to aging staffers with no skin in the game.” While the youth seem to be nowhere to be found in the EU institutions’ corridors, can we at least say that the voices of young people are heard and considered in the EU’s institutional processes that create the policies affecting their future?
“I think in recent years we have seen a greater effort made by the EU institutions to try and ensure that young people’s voices are being heard and considered. This is primarily done through providing young people with platforms to have their opinions heard,” argues Anna Hackett, former Schuman Trainee at the Parliament’s liaison office in Dublin, while pointing at examples such as the Parliament’s biannual European Youth Event (EYE) and the EU Youth Dialogue. Moreover, Hackett pointed to proposed and adopted legislation—such as the European climate law,  measures adopted to reduce packaging waste, air pollution, and methane emissions, the EU directive combating violence against women and domestic violence, and MEPs adopting measures to improve the working conditions of platform workers and allowing people with disabilities equal access to preferential conditions—which are all in sync with the youth’s concerns. In this sense, “you could argue that the issues most pertinent to young people are being considered and debated at the institutional level,” Hackett continues, while recognising that young people could certainly be given more of a meaningful voice in the institutional process.
Alessandra Cardaci, Head of Programming and Operations at Debating Europe, offers a similar view to that of Hackett as she emphasises the EU initiatives and projects that aim to increase young people’s representation in the EU’s institutional processes: From recruiting young staff and retaining talent via programmes within the EU institutions (e.g. the Junior Professionals Programme of the European Commission) to including quotas for young people in pan-European deliberative processes (e.g. the Conference on the Future of Europe), and lowering the voting age to 16 years old for the EU elections in some countries for the first time in 2024. However, Cardaci acknowledges that “despite these are all valuable initiatives, the problem is often the lack of awareness around them as well as their perceived limited impact.” She recounts that according to a recent Debating Europe study, “2024 Voices – Citizens Speak Up!”, young people do not see the value of going to vote as they do not feel represented by politicians. “Indeed, especially in some countries, it is still quite rare to see young political leaders the youth can identify with. This is why some of the citizens participating in the project suggested for example to include youth quotas in Parliaments, like we sometimes do for gender,” says Cardaci.
Eduvigis Sardà articulates a more critical view. While she recognised that the EU gives priority to the youth in its projects and funds, she expressed that “there is still a need to create spaces for young workers (not grant holders) to be able to participate actively and representatively in European policies.”
TNGO asks: Do you find the job market or the “EU Bubble” inclusive? If not, how do you think this could be improved?
Alessandra Cardaci:No, unfortunately, I do not find the EU job market particularly inclusive and that is quite evident when you walk around the EU quarter in Brussels. However, there are some positive trends with initiatives to promote gender balance, geographic diversity, and representation of different age groups.
By broadening recruitment practices, enhancing accessibility, fostering an inclusive workplace culture, implementing policy changes, and strengthening outreach efforts, the “EU bubble” could become a more inclusive environment —and that would certainly positively impact EU policy-making.
Anna Hackett:I think some efforts have been made to make the job market in the EU bubble more inclusive. For example, the European Parliament, the European Ombudsman, and the Council of the EU all offer Positive Action schemes for trainees with disabilities, with the Parliament also offering similar programmes for contract agents. The Commission’s Blue Book traineeship also states that it is open to all EU citizens, regardless of factors such as age, gender, race, social origin, religion, or disability. Furthermore, the European Personnel Selection Office claims that it strives to offer equal opportunities and access to all candidates regardless of factors like age, race, religion, language, political beliefs, etc. In some applications, you must also declare whether you have a relative employed in one of the institutions, in a measure to help combat nepotism. These are all very promising things to consider when hoping to get your foot in the door of one of the institutions. It has been very refreshing even in my own experience at the Parliament in meeting fellow trainees and assistants of all different backgrounds.
Of course, I can only speak of my own experiences, and I would imagine that for others the reality can sadly be very different.  I imagine that the EPSO competitions can create barriers for some candidates, such as those who, for example, cannot afford to take time off work or childminding to study.
Communications officer (anonymous):I think that if there are some keywords in your CV, you might have an easier time than others to get a first job in the bubble. Nowadays those are:
It is a very elitist recruitment environment. Maybe you can try a consultancy and have your first burnout experience or in a not-super-sexy association where they have more problems recruiting. But if you want a sexy job in a sexy place, unless you have the keywords, know someone and/or do the EU institutions traineeships, you can find yourself in a difficult position.
Sidenote about the EU institutions traineeships: Did you know that only if you have a university degree, you can apply to the selection process? And, if you apply, bear in mind that people are applying with 2 masters! This year was the European Year of Skills, promoting professional training to upskill the workforce and to train future generations of workers. Well, prepare for a hypocritical slap from the EU institutions: People with professional training titles are not allowed to apply for their traineeships.
Of course, when we talk about inclusion in the gender sense, we are more or less covered. The LGTBQ+ collective is not discriminated against. But let’s not talk about skin colour! Inclusive jobs are in “cool topics”, and there are not so many cool topics in the Brussels bubble.
Eduvigis Sardà:I believe that although a great deal of effort has been made to make the institutions more inclusive, they have many difficulties in boosting the target groups of the proposed measures. It would be important to impose down-up policies that focus more on the establishment and education of a series of values that must live and last in the EU and its workers.
Nathan Canas:It is harder for people coming from rural areas and with no connections to EU Affairs to work in this sector. When Italk with colleagues, very few come from a similar background as mine.For people coming from rural areas or with less privileged socioeconomic backgrounds, you have to make double or triple the effort to break through your career in Brussels. Now, while I would not say meritocracy really exists in the EU Bubble, two days ago, a friend of mine, who grew up in a rural area with very scarce resources, called me because he had got a Blue Book traineeship, so I guess sometimes you can see success stories like this one.
Personally, I think that positive discrimination can have good aspects, but also it might allow employers to hide behind an “inclusive” label without actually making efforts to promote inclusivity. I think perhaps more blind selection processes focused on competenciesand skills might be a good option, but even this is a flawed approach.
No doubt, active citizenship in the EU and trust in its institutions are paramount for the continuation and strengthening of the EU project. APew Research Center reportfound that younger people’s support for the EU is significantly stronger than the generations that came before them, with younger people (ages 18 to 34) having more favourable views than older counterparts (ages 60 and older) when it comes to the EU in 13 countries. This support is sometimes reflected in participation in pro-European organisations like JEF (Young European Federalists), as Javier Carbonell highlights in a piece forCIDOB, or sometimes through electoral participation: Even though younger voters are usually less likely to vote than older generations,datahas shown that in the 2019 European elections, the younger generation (under 25) increased their electoral participation by 14% to 42%, while the participation of 25–39-year-olds increased by 12% to 47%.
Despite a much greater increase in their turnout compared to other generations and somewhat positive views towards the EU, at present, voters under 30 account for just a sixth of the overall European electorate. Still, as Pawel Zerka writes for theEuropean Council on Foreign Affairsthe youth is a “strategically important electorate that should not be neglected, or prematurely written off, by pro-European parties.” This is something that political parties are aware of. According toCarbonell, “European parties are striving to reach young voters through social media campaigns or supporting their youth organisations.”However,“as far as representation of candidates is concerned, the results are less impressive: […] currently only 6% of MEPs are under 35.”
For Carbonell, while young people were not a priority for the EU until the last legislative term, the consensus in favour of youth policies by political parties is reflected on an institutional level in campaigns by both the Commission and the Parliament. In this sense, following the 2019 elections, major institutional efforts have been made to reach out to young adults. The year 2022 was declared theEuropean Year of Youth—as part of the Year, the Commission identified more than 130 policy initiatives for young people, many of which were developed in close cooperation with the youth—, theEU Youth Strategywas created, theYouth Guarantee Programmewas reinforced and on April theEuropean Youth Week 2024was celebrated with the aim to promote youth engagement, participation, and active citizenship through a series of activities all over Europe. Moreover, the European Commission announced the creation of aYouth Checkthat looks to include the participation of young people in the design of EU policies.
However, there seems to be quite a split in how the youth experience the EU. Aflash Eurobarometerconducted by the European Parliament Youth Survey in 2021 found that 55% of respondents say they do not understand much or anything about the EU, while 42% say they understand a great deal or a fair amount. More worryingly, most respondents felt they did not have much or any say over important decisions, laws, and policies affecting them. This feeling increased the more distant the sphere of governance under consideration was: 53% feel they do not have much or any say over decisions, laws, and policies affecting their local area, rising to 70% for matters affecting the EU as a whole. This report also highlighted that while around three in five (62%) respondents are generally in favour of the EU, 34% of respondents are dissatisfied with the way the EU is working at present while only 28% are satisfied.
TNGO asks: To what extent do you agree that the EU institutions in Brussels are accessible to ordinary citizens?
Alessandra Cardaci:I believe there is a genuine willingness from the EU institutions to become more appealing towards the citizens they represent and reduce its democratic deficit. The Conference on the Future of Europe is a great example of this direction, as the three top EU institutions, namely the Commission, Parliament, and Council, have managed to jointly initiate the biggest ever pan-European deliberative process involving citizens from all walks of life in multilingual physical and online gatherings to produce recommendations on the future of Europe. However, as the latest EU election results show in terms of voting preference and low turnout, the reality is that most citizens still perceive the EU as far away and detached from their reality.
This is also whyDebating Europeexists: To meet citizens where they are and offer them accessible, politically neutral, and safe opportunities to engage and exchange with peers and make their voices heard. It is then our duty to channel citizens’ perspectives in the EU bubble via the work of the think tank we are part of, Friends of Europe.
Anna Hackett:  I believe that while the EU institutions are to an extent trying to increase their accessibility to ordinary citizens, many people still feel like the EU bubble is a distant world. No doubt, conscious efforts have been made to ‘open up’ the institutions to the public. For instance, anyone can book free visits to [several institutions]. [Moreover], anyone with internet access can also see for themselves what goes on within. One can watch live web streams of sessions such as the European Parliament committee meetings and plenary debates or the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly debates. Transparency regarding the work of the institutions also manifests in the press releases and statements published by the various press services as well as on numerous official social media channels. One could go on listing all the different ways the institutions try and be open, from the Eur-Lex platform which allows anyone to read the law-making procedures, legal acts, and treaties, etc. of the European Union, to the What Europe Does for Me website which details how EU funding has improved European regions and lives.
Yet, despite all this, the EU does feel very far away and confusing to many people. Unless you are actively looking for information and stumble upon some of the aforementioned platforms and websites, it is unlikely you will come across this information by chance. Even with the hard work of Liaison and Representation offices and Europe Direct Centres, many members of the public still do not know or understand the structure, competencies, or exact role of the EU and its institutions. In my own experience, whenever it came up that I worked at the European Parliament, oftentimes I was asked what it was like having Ursula von der Leyen as a boss.
More can definitely be done to increase this general awareness about the institutions. Not even just by said institutions themselves, but perhaps through more cooperation with national and local media and educational institutes.
Communications officer (anonymous):In general, I think yes. What I think though is that citizens and the bubble live in completely different realities and that some decisions are not taken to improve the EU but to follow models that do not take into account the reality of the situations outside of the bubble. There is a lack of awareness of what the EU is doing for the citizens and a lack of participation from the public in European politics.
Nathan Canas:The processes inside the EU are quite complex, with so many institutions working together to produce a Directive or Regulation. I understand the challenges in coordinating 27 Member States, but the complexity of the EU entails that not many understand it and how it works. Right now, as we are campaigning for EU elections,  I can realise this. Moreover, the language surrounding the EU is specific jargon, policy-packed, and you will see the same words repeated all over.There is a gap between citizens and the European Union.
Our respondents
Having surveyed young Europeans residing in Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, most of whose ages ranged from 18 to 24 and whose occupations ranged from students and interns to employed, on issues extending from the EU’s transparency to whether the institutions tackle the problems affecting the youth, TNGO highlights the following key findings.
TNGO asks: Do you believe the EU institutions in Brussels are transparent in their decision-making?
Alessandra Cardaci:I believe that EU institutions are among the most transparent ones in the world; so relatively speaking, as an EU citizen, I am proud of the quality of our EU public administration. However, scandals such as the so-called “Qatargate” that impacted some Members of the European Parliament in late 2022 can certainly undermine this reputation. Moreover, the EU is not the strongest in public engagement and communication, partially due to its own inherent complex structure and decision-making procedures, as well as its multicultural and multilingual nature.
It’s indeed relevant to remember that the EU institutions in Brussels with the biggest powers are: The European Commission which can only propose —and execute— EU laws; the European Parliament with elected Members from all over the EU and multiple political affiliations; and lastly, but surely not least, the Council of the EU which ultimately has the biggest influence in EU decision-making, and it’s composed of EU national governments. So, if we refer to the transparency of EU decision-making, we should then also question the transparency of all 27 EU Member States’ national governments.
AtFriends of Europe, the Brussels-based think tank for a more inclusive, forward-looking, and sustainable Europe, we have embarked on a long-term mission to contribute to redesigning Europe’s social contract by 2030 and this includes reforming EU institutions to improve their coherence and efficacy, as presented in our “10 Policy Choices for a Renewed Social Contract” report released in late February 2024.
Communications officer (anonymous):Overall, it depends. Lately, their transparency has been decreasing. The decision-making in the Council is a black box: They close the door and when they open it, you know what’s been decided. On the other side of the Schuman roundabout, at the Commission, there are negotiations and discussions with the relevant stakeholders. Ultimately to get a law approved, the paper needs to go to the Council and the Parliament, and you can follow the parliament’s votes via livestream, but the last word is always on theblack boxCouncil.
“How the young vote and whether they vote at all, should be another major ingredient in the post-electoral interpretation of European sentiment”,wrote Pavel Zerkajust a few months before the 2024 EU Elections.
In the 2019 European Parliament election, young voters turned to the polls in record numbers showing their enthusiasm for the common European project and casting their ballots for green parties. Unlike 2019, however, we are observing “the first signs of a populist insurrection of the young,” Albena Azmanova notes inThe Guardian. In both European and national elections, albeit with different degrees among countries, support for far-right parties has overall increased across voters under 30 inGermany,France,Spain,Italy,Portugal, andBelgium. This, she argues, would be the result of the neglect of the youth’s anxieties and the emergence of a novel concern among this group: economic uncertainty.
In thewordsof Christian Edwards,“[p]erhaps the “left behind” is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational.”For a generation that has been baptised in crises—first the financial, then eurozone and post-pandemic, and now the one derived from the war in Ukraine—, precarious work and high youth unemployment rates leave26% of the youth at risk of povertyand social exclusion, while the age that young adults move out of the family home has increased throughout Europe as a result of the housing crisis, making this generation vulnerable to the lure of populism. This dire social situation leads to huge mistrust of politics and institutions, explains Carbonell, with apathy turning into antipathy.
To explain the increase in popularity of far-right parties among the German youth,researcherstend to cite general unhappiness with the post-pandemic economic and political conditions, with astudyfinding that inflation, the economy, old-age poverty, professional opportunities, the health sector, and social recognition were among the issues prompting a sense of insecurity as described by participants. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people. In the wake of the pandemic, war in Ukraine, and soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people’s priority, Heinrichs toldCNN. In the case of the Netherlands, youth support in national elections for the Partij voor de Vrijheid (Party for Freedom) is also related to economic grievances. Bestaanszekerheid or “livelihood security”, that is, having a decent and regular income, a comfortable home, access to education and health care, and a buffer against unexpected problems is key to explaining the Dutch youth vote. “Young peoples’ leading concerns in the Netherlands are housing, overcrowded classes, and struggling hospitals which Wilders addressed in his campaign,” said Catherine de Vries, a political scientist at Italy’s Bocconi University, toThe Guardian. It seems, thus, that job precarity and economic insecurity are not issues that affect the EU bubble exclusively but are rather weights that are felt by the European youth’s shoulders at large.
While some argue that the youth’s allegiancescould switch again, otherswarnthat voters at the past EU elections were often new voters, who started their electoral adventure by choosing the far-right and therefore may continue doing so in the future. For Carbonell something is clear,“[t]he challenge for the EU […] is to address the demands of young people so that their grievances are not politicised by Eurosceptic forces.”Indeed, already in 2018, Brian Ager, European Round Table of Industrialists’ (ERT) Secretary General, toldPolitico“[w]e need to understand the hopes and expectations of young people, to further advance and improve the European project.”

Democracy in Decline:Cause of Peru’s High Emigration Rate,"In April, the Mexican government’s announcement regarding thereintroduction of visa requirementsfor Peruvian citizens intending to enter Mexican territory made headlines. This measure marks a reinstatement after the requirement was eliminated in 2012. Since then, Mexico has seen a steady increase in the number of Peruvian citizens who, upon arriving in the country, head towards the northern border with the United States.
Indeed, thefiguresreported by the Mexican Interior Ministry are significant. From 2021 to 2023, over 35,833 cases of denial of entry for Peruvian citizens were recorded at admission points, most due to inconsistencies in the purpose of travel. During the same period, more than 143,933 cases of people crossing the border irregularly from Mexico to a third country were identified, along with 7,053 cases of Peruvian citizens presenting themselves to immigration authorities without demonstrating their status as regular immigrants in the country.
Even more striking are thefigures related to the overall numberof Peruvian citizens who left the country in the past two years. In 2022, there were 401,740 departures, almost four times the number recorded in 2021, more than in any year since 1990. However, the number is expected to grow as the latest available data shows. In the first half of 2023, another 400,000 Peruvians left, some headed to European destinations like Spain and Italy, others to Mexico and its northern border with the United States. Some succeed in crossing the border illegally, with an increasing number as demonstrated bydata from US Customs and Border Protection, which reported 78,202 encounters with Peruvian citizens at the US-Mexico border in the fiscal year 2023, a 47% increase compared to 2022.
Congress’s controversial moves driving Peru’s exodus
The factors driving migration are obviously multiple in the Peruvian case, linked to organized crime and thus to the insecurity tied to theexpansion of criminal groups like the Tren de Aragua, a sluggish and evencontracting economy, and perhaps most importantly, the erosion of the rule of law and democracy, the most precious asset. Regarding the latter, in the past year and a half, Peru has been governed by a coalition diverse in ideological terms, sharing probably only their strong unpopularity, with Prime Minister Dina Boluarte registering anapproval rating of just 5%, making her the most unpopular president of Peru in the last 44 years. But what is this due to? The answer lies in the coalition itself that governs the country and the congressional maneuvers aimed at ensuring the coalition and its leaders remain firmly in power. Among the most unpopular measures is likely the approval last March ofamendments to 58 articles of the 1993 constitution. The most significant change resulting from this reform is the transformation of the unicameral Congress into a bicameral one by reinstating a 60-member Chamber of Senators to function alongside a 130-member Chamber of Deputies (Art. 90). Presidential candidates may now simultaneously run for senator or deputy. Moreover, senators and deputies may now seek immediate re-election to the same position without term limits. The legislators intended this as a side effect to concentrate power at the congressional level at the expense of the executive, which will be essentially controlled by the former. This reform seems even more out of place considering that in a 2018 referendum, more than 90 % of Peruvian voters rejected bicameralism and 85% opposed the immediate re-election of congressmen.
Another highly unpopular measure approved by Congress, also in March, is therepeal of legislative decree 1607, aimed at combating illegal mining. The decision sparked strong criticism, as the decree sought to formalize mining activities and distinguish between legal and illegal miners. The suspension of the decree, made without the usual review, would facilitate illegal mining activities, damaging ecosystems and limiting police action against the illegal use of explosives in mines. Illegal mining linked to informal mines is a booming industry in Peru, allowing criminal groups present in the territory to enrich themselves, expand, and especially organize, as demonstrated by someattacks on a police convoyby gold miners’ gangs in the Peruvian province of La Libertad.
A path forward for a brighter future
The future at this moment seems far from rosy for Peruvian democracy and its citizens forced to emigrate from their land, leaving behind a country where they would like to build their future. However, it is time to question what should be done to avoid the definitive erosion of democracy in the country. It is imperative to undertake a path of deep reforms to regenerate a political system now devoid of legitimacy and incapable of serving as a relief valve for an increasingly polarized and disillusioned society. In particular, international efforts should focus on ensuring free and fair elections in 2026, paying particular attention to the selection process of new electoral authorities. Even modest international attention can make a difference, especially if accompanied by financial and technical support to civil society promoting dialogue among various social sectors.
Foreign powers should also pressure the government to respect the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and other human rights organizations. It is essential to dissuade Peruvian authorities from launching new attacks on the autonomy of democratic institutions, such as the National Justice Council and the National Electoral Jury, as undermining the independence of these institutions would severely damage the credibility of future elections and the legitimacy of the judicial system.
Only through inclusive dialogue and the willingness to undertake deep political and constitutional reforms can polarization be addressed, and party fragmentation ended. The polarization between increasingly radical versions of the right and left requires a concerted effort to create common ground, outlining reforms that can be adopted by elected representatives before the next elections. The current government must recognize the urgency of these reforms, necessary to rebuild the legitimacy and stability of the Peruvian political system, preventing the country from plunging into a new and more violent political and social crisis.

Protection against Climate Change is now a Human Right – The Impact of ECtHR’s Swiss Climate ruling,"Human rights are open-ended. ⁤⁤They are not a fixed or limited set of rights. ⁤⁤Instead, they are constantly evolving to enable authorities to protect citizens from unforeseen challenges. ⁤⁤Climate change is one such transnational challenge. ⁤⁤Its impacts are far-reaching, not only harming the environment but also threatening human health and the lives of millions of people worldwide. ⁤⁤Extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, interrupted food chains and disrupted ecosystems have exacerbated existing inequalities, pushing vulnerable populations to the brink of poverty and displacement. ⁤⁤Thus, humans face climate change as a threat to their existence. ⁤
Legal frameworks have been increasingly recognising and incorporating climate change considerations into human rights protections. On April 9, 2024, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) gave a comprehensive decision on a climate litigation case. This is the first time that an international court linked the protection of human rights with the measures to mitigate the greenhouse effect. The court handed down judgements in three cases (Verein Klima Seniorinnen Schweiz and Ors vs Switzerland;Carême vs France; andDuarte Agostinho and Others vs Portugal and 32 Others) relating to States’ commitment towards climate change under theEuropean Convention on Human Rights.  While the claims in the Carême and Duarte cases were regarded as objectionable, in the KlimaSeniorinnen case, the court found the government of Switzerland to be guilty of violating the rights established underArticles 2and8of the convention, thus setting a precedent for climate protection all around the world.
The cases, despite being filed in different timelines, regions, and circumstances and possessing distinct verdicts, share common elements. All three cases are centred around the governments’ ineffectiveness in protecting its citizens against climate change, specifically questioning their inefficiency in implementing emission reduction targets. The cases challenged the States based on their human rights: Article 2,Article 6(Right to a fair and public hearing), Article 8 andArticle 14(Protection against Discrimination). They all drew inspiration from theUrgenda decision, a milestone in climate-rights based litigation. Besides, KlimaSeniorinnen, Carême and Duarte were heard by thesame compositionof the Grand Chamber, demonstrating consistency across the three varied judgements.
Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Ors vs Switzerland:The historic judgement was given in the case brought up jointly byVerein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz(Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection), a group of more than 2,500 Swiss women aged 64 or over, supported byGreenpeaceand four individual Swiss nationals. Their primary argument was that due to their age, they were at risk of health impacts of excessive heat waves, invading their right to life (Article 2) and right to private and family life (Article 8). Further, they alleged that the Swiss authorities were aware of the risks yet failed to protect its citizens, endangering the lives of the 2,500 members. According to the plaintiffs, Switzerland was unsuccessful in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and complying with the2015 Paris Agreement targets.  The Court found the Swiss authorities’ inability to establish and regulate a domestic framework for tackling the issue. In compliance with it, the Court determined that Switzerland and its courts’ inaction breached Article 8 and further on Article 6.
Carême vs France: The case was brought up by Damien Carême against the French government. In his appeal to the ECtHR, Carême, a resident and mayor of Grande-Synthe, contended that being exposed to climate-related risks such as coastal erosion, floods, and coastal flooding infringed upon his right to private and family life and his right to life. Nevertheless, during the hearing, the applicant acknowledged no longer residing in France. Consequently, the ECtHR determined that since the applicant was no longer living in Grande-Synthe, nor did he own or rent property there, he could not claim victim status under theConvention (para. 84). In its assessment, the ECtHR cited the established general principles of victim status in KlimaSeniorinnen.
Duarte Agostinho and Others vs Portugal and 32 Others:The case was filed by six Portuguese youths against33 countries. They asserted that the respondents were insufficient in protecting their citizens against the harmful effects of climate change. The complaint, which has been ongoing since 2020, was declared inadmissible on two grounds. Firstly, the ECtHR reduced the territorial jurisdiction to only Portugal and dismissed the complaint against the other 32 states. Secondly, the court noted that the applicants failed to exhaust domestic remedies before the Portuguese courts.
The ECtHR’s Swiss ruling is in agreement with theEuropean Climate Law. This regulation seeks to establish and uphold a framework for achieving climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 and reducing net emissions of greenhouse gases by 55% by 2030. The ruling upholds the law in the following ways:-
While only KlimaSeniorinnen has emerged successful out of the three high-profile cases, it has paved the way for rights-based litigation all over the world. At the same time, it is questioning its political legitimacy and calling it intrusive, leading to many member states such as the UKconsidering withdrawing from the ECHR. On the other hand, the Swiss Parliament hasrejectedECtHR’s verdict.
Nevertheless, it has set a new precedent for cases not only within the European Union but also globally. Internally, the domestic courts will have to keep in view the ruling. In cases such as Duarte, they may emerge victorious against Portugal because of this precedent. Globally, forums such as theInternational Court of Justice,International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea,South Korea Constitutional Courtetcetera which have seen an overwhelming number of cases in the past years could take inspiration and draw similar conclusions.
The KlimaSeniorinnen victory has become a source of hope and inspiration for climate activism movements across the globe. As the threat of climate change looms, the precedent established by ECtHR will likely be referenced in future climate-related legal proceedings, contributing to the effort to combat climate change whilst protecting human rights.

Protecting beyond borders: keys to successful Amazon environmental governance.,"The Amazon, which spans approximately 6,118,000 km² across eight South American nations, represents an ecosystem of vital importance for global climate regulation and biodiversity conservation. However, this ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented threats. Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and inadequate governance are jeopardizing its ability to maintain global ecological balance. Despite the establishment of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (ACT) in 1978 and the formation of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) in 1998, effective transnational governance of the Amazon remains a challenge. In this context, the need arises to explore alternative approaches to the protection of the Amazon.
Paradiplomacy, defined as international relations conducted by sub-state actors such as provinces and cities, emerges as a possible complementary solution to traditional state-centered models of environmental governance. This study examines the potential of paradiplomacy as a mechanism for addressing the complex challenges facing the Amazon ecosystem. It is postulated that paradiplomatic initiatives undertaken by subnational governments in collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international agencies have the potential to make a significant contribution to the sustained focus on Amazon conservation and to overcome the limitations of traditional governance. In this sense, the primary objective is to provide an overview of the current status of cooperation among Amazonian countries and to offer a novel perspective on multilevel environmental governance in one of the most critical regions of the world. This is with a view to developing future strategies for conservation and sustainable development.
The Amazon, the planet’s largest tropical forest biome, plays a key role in regulating global climate (Aquae Foundation 2021) and mitigating anthropogenicclimate change(Zaar 2021). Covering approximately 6,118,000 km² of the watershed’s surface area and extending across nine South American nations (ACTO 2024), this vast ecosystem harbours great biodiversity and provides critical ecosystem services for global environmental stability.
The Amazon basin functions as a major carbon sink, taking up and storing significant amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Vicuña et al. 2018). Recent research by the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project estimates that Amazonian forests contain approximately 37 billion metric tons of carbon across the Amazon in their biomass (MAAP 2023). This carbon absorption process is crucial to mitigating the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The photosynthetic process of the Amazonian flora not only captures CO2, but also releases oxygen and water vapor into the atmosphere (Carvajal et al. 2014). The latter contributes significantly to the regional and global hydrological cycle, influencing rainfall patterns in such distant and far-flung areas (Jordao 2018). This phenomenon, known as “flying rivers,” according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP 2022), underlines the transcontinental importance of the Amazon in climate regulation.
In addition, the Amazon plays a crucial role in modulating global temperatures. The dense vegetation cover absorbs a substantial amount of solar radiation, contributing to the cooling of the earth’s surface (Fundación M.J. Bustamante de la Fuente 2010). Evapotranspiration from Amazonian flora amplifies this cooling effect, releasing moisture into the atmosphere and forming clouds that reflect incident solar radiation (Walschburger, 2020).
However, despite its importance as a regulator, the Amazon faces a number of threats that jeopardize its ability to mitigate climate change and maintain global ecological stability.Deforestation, driven by illegal logging, expansion of the agricultural frontier (particularly for soy production and extensive cattle ranching), and mining activities, is causing an alarming loss of forest cover (WWF 2016). This extensive deforestation not only directly reduces forest cover but also exacerbates another serious problem: forest fires. Many of these fires, often of anthropogenic origin, further contribute to the degradation of this crucial ecosystem.
Another driver is habitat fragmentation, which severely threatens the ecological integrity of the Amazon. The construction of infrastructure such as roads and hydroelectric dams is segmenting the forest into isolated patches, affecting biodiversity and reducing the ecosystem’s capacity to absorb carbon and resist climate change (Wenzel et al. 2022). Projects such as the Interoceanic Highway have opened areas of primary forest to exploitation, facilitating deforestation and illegal logging (Johanson 2024). This fragmentation not only disrupts natural wildlife corridors, but also catalyzes the colonization of previously inaccessible areas.
Finally, it is inexorable to mention that poor governance hinders the conservation and sustainable management of the Amazon. Lack of cross-country coordination, corruption and inadequate enforcement of environmental laws allow illegal activities to thrive in protected areas (Glave andBorasino 2019). The absence of an effective transnational governance framework has resulted in contradictory policies, where short-term economic interests often prevail over environmental considerations (Ipenza 2014).
The preservation of the Amazon transcends regional responsibility, becoming a global imperative. Its preponderant role in climate regulation and climate change mitigation makes its protection crucial for the future of the biosphere. The international community must work synergistically with Amazonian countries to ensure the survival and health of this vital ecosystem for the planet.
In order to ensure the proper administration of the Amazon, theAmazon Cooperation Treaty(ACT) was signed in Brasília on 3 July 1978, withBrazil,Colombia,Venezuela,Peru,Ecuador,Guyana,Suriname, andBoliviaas signatory countries. The main objective of the ACT is to promote the harmonious development of the Amazonian territories of the signatory countries (ACT 1978). It aims for fair and mutually advantageous outcomes, while also focusing on environmental preservation and the responsible use of the region’s natural resources. (ACT 1978). In this regard, to achieve a balance between environmental preservation and economic growth in the Amazon region, the Treaty proposes actions such as promoting scientific research, conserving flora and fauna, coordinating health services and stimulating the social and economic development of the Amazon territories. By fostering cooperation among member countries, the ACT seeks to create a unified approach to managing the unique challenges of the Amazon, ensuring sustainable development that benefits both the environment and the local populations.
The ACT is implemented through theAmazon Cooperation Treaty Organization(ACTO 1998), whose goal is to promote the sustainable development of the Amazon region, improve the well-being of its populations, and strengthen the sovereignty of member countries. ACTO focuses on regional and international cooperation, creating programs and projects for sustainable forest management, conservation, and training, ensuring long-term benefits for local communities and preserving the Amazon’s ecological, social, and economic importance. The “ACTO’s highest instance is the Meeting of Foreign Ministers, supported by the Amazon Cooperation Council (CCA) and the Coordination Commission of the Amazon Cooperation Council (CCOOR). At the national level, Member Countries have Permanent National Commissions (PNC) responsible for implementing the provisions of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty within their respective territories” (ACTO 2010, 11).
The Amazon Summit held in Belém do Pará on August 8th and 9th, 2023, highlighted the lack of consensus regarding the ambitious goal of achieving zero deforestation by 2030 and taking decisive actions against fossil fuel exploitation, reflecting the political and economic disparities among the region’s countries (El Peruano 2023).
TheBelém Declaration, signed during the Amazon Summit, outlines objectives for cooperation against illicit activities and establishes a financial mechanism, yet it lacks specific goals to address deforestation and illicit economies (Marengo, 2023). In this sense, while it is true that regional efforts to address deforestation have been proposed, none have effectively mitigated the severe negative impacts on the Amazon Forest and its ecosystems. Despite the urgency, the OTCA has struggled to enforce robust forest protection policies due to a lack of political will to address the limitations posed by national sovereignty (Lizarazo et al. 2021).
This complex scenario is further complicated by the varying levels of commitment and progress among Amazonian countries in addressing deforestation and ecosystem preservation. A notable example of positive progress can be observed in Brazil, which witnessed a 36% decline in deforestation under the leadership ofPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, marking the lowest level since 2015 (WRI, 2024). These remarkable achievements are attributed to the president’s focus on prioritizing environmental protection and implementing effective conservation strategies. However, other countries like Peru have not shown strong commitment to fighting deforestation and preserving ecosystems, despite ratifying international treaties (Marengo, 2023). These disparities in commitment and action regarding deforestation and ecosystem preservation among Amazonian countries illustrate the diverse visions and capacities of each member country. The persistent prioritization of short-term national interests over the long-term survival of the Amazon rainforest is not only shortsighted but potentially catastrophic; it is crucial to establish urgent and decisive cooperative efforts among these countries to prevent irreversible damage to the Amazon, regardless of individual political or economic agendas.
The latter half of the 21st century has witnessed a proliferation of significant political and socioeconomic challenges across Latin America. Although the protection of the Amazon has been and will continue to be a matter of crucial importance, the current circumstances faced by Latin American countries have relegated this issue to their governmental agendas. Given these conditions, it is relevant to consider the potential contribution of paradiplomacy to maintaining attention in the Amazon region.
Paradiplomacy is the practice of international relations carried out by sub-state actors like provinces and cities, aiming to meet their specific needs through international cooperation (Noe 2018). This concept is closely related to cross-border management, which Gallardo Pérez (2005) identified as the origin of non-central governments interest in international affairs. Paradiplomacy in transborder regions can optimize coordination between neighboring states in areas such as technical assistance, information exchange, and the management of shared resources.
At this point, it is necessary to make a clear theoretical distinction between paradiplomacy and protodiplomacy. The functional objective of the former focuses on guaranteeing or improving the functioning of non-central government or community development, generally due to economic needs, cultural development, or knowledge transfer, among other reasons. Economic, border-related, and altruistic motivations usually pursue almost exclusively these functionalist objectives. On the other hand, protodiplomacy is the international activity of non-central governments with separatist intentions (Alvarez 2021). In the Amazon, we identify paradiplomacy as an instrument that allows subnational governments, within their constitutional competencies, to be an extension of the central government and, through decentralized international cooperation, to achieve the ultimate goal of the State, which is the well-being of the population.
In the absence of action from the state and ACTO, indigenous peoples and subnational governments are increasingly seeking assistance from NGOs and international organizations. Notable organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the Amazon Fund play a pivotal role in providing assistance and safeguarding the Amazon region. These entities facilitate the implementation of ecosystem conservation projects, sustainable development initiatives, and the defense of the rights of indigenous populations and the environment. They do so in collaboration with local authorities.
The emergence of paradiplomacy in the Amazon is evidenced by the conclusion of investment agreements, the implementation of joint projects, and the participation of regional actors in international forums. It is important to acknowledge that, despite the strengthening of environmental cooperation in the region through these alliances, they are not without challenges including conflicts of interest and legal barriers.
The dynamics of environmental governance inBrazilillustrate how the attitude of the central government affects Amazon paradiplomacy. The executive’s attitude toward international cooperation is critical to the synergy between NGOs, international agencies, and subnational governments in conserving the Amazon biome. The contrast between the Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva administrations illustrates this dynamic. Bolsonaro has taken an antagonistic stance,dismantling environmental monitoring mechanisms and withdrawing support for the Amazon Fund, leading to record deforestation in 2023. In contrast, Lula in his new government has promoted a policy of multilateral engagement, reactivating international cooperation for the conservation of the Amazon (Phillips 2023). This openness has facilitated the participation of non-state and sub-national actors in conservation initiatives, strengthening multilevelenvironmental governance. The reactivation of the Amazon Fund and Brazil’s selection by the UN to host COP30 reflect this shift towards a more robust and collaborative environmental paradigm (El Comercio 2023).
The concept of paradiplomacy represents a novel and promising paradigm in the domain of environmental governance within the Amazon region. This study has demonstrated how paradiplomatic initiatives can effectively supplement traditional state-led conservation efforts, offering a more adaptive and responsive approach to local complexities.
The findings of this study indicate that the proactive involvement of subnational governments, in collaboration with non-governmental organizations and international entities, can have a positive impact on the preservation of the Amazon ecosystem. This multilevel approach has demonstrated its potential to transcend the inherent limitations of governance in Latin America, facilitating more agile and contextualized responses to environmental challenges. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the implementation of paradiplomatic strategies presents its own set of challenges.
The lack of political commitment from Amazonian nations, as evidenced at the 2023 Amazon Summit, persists as a significant obstacle. Similarly, the ongoing tension between short-term economic imperatives and long-term conservation objectives represents a significant challenge in the formulation and implementation of effective environmental policies.
In conclusion, as the Amazon region persists in facing critical threats, paradiplomacy represents an innovation in environmental governance that merits further analysis and development. Future research should concentrate on evaluating the long-term impacts of paradiplomatic initiatives and investigating modalities for integrating these efforts more effectively with national and international conservation policies.

China-Taiwan: New Beijing’s Propaganda Campaign Target Taiwan’s Youth,"Tensions between China and Taiwan have simmered for decades, with China’s ruling Communist Party (CCP) consistently assertingTaiwan being part of its territory. Tension escalated sharply when Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, Lai Ching- Te (賴清德) secures as Taiwan’s President. In the wake of his election, waves of propaganda and threats from Beijing emerged. Observers have noted that Beijing’s propaganda has evolved and become multifaceted, with a particular focus on targeting Taiwanese youth.
In the eyes of Beijing, the DPP advocates independence. Just three days after Lai’s inauguration, China conducted a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, codenamedJoint Sword-2024A. Chinese state-owned media and officials described the exercise as a“punishment” for Taiwan separatists”.
Away from the headline-grabbing military threats, Beijing has increasingly leveraged its soft power to influence Taiwan.
Chinese leader Xi Jin-Ping (習近平) has strengthened the role of the United Front Work Department.Targeting grassroots Taiwanese society, Beijing has cultivated village-level elected officials, splinter parties, temple societies, and even triad gangs. Additionally, the department has organizedtrips and exchange eventsaimed at fostering Chinese patriotism and promoting unification among young Taiwanese. While Beijing asserts that these events are merely cultural and intended to nurture Taiwanese youth patriotism, many remainskeptical.
Beijing’s approach has become more assertive. Their strength in propaganda has become more prominent since the new Taiwan election in the beginning of the year. Following Lai’s inauguration,dozens of Taiwanese artists and actorshave endorsed Beijing’s territorial claim by retweeting a Chinese state media post supporting eventual “unification.”
Mayday, a popular band loved by Taiwanese, its lead singer Ashin (阿信) declare during a concert in Beijing, “We Chinese, when we come to Beijing, we must eat Peking duck.”. The reference as Chinese instead of Taiwanese sparked immediate anger back home. Similarly, Taiwanese pop diva Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) stated during a concert in Nanchang City, “We, China’s Nanchang, are the most passionate.” These statements sparked intense discussion among netizens and many Taiwanese areupsetabout such statement.

Taiwanese legislatorLee Yen-Hsiu(李彥秀), commented that Beijing’s pressure on entertainers to make political statements does not help build goodwill between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. This move is seen as a clear response to Lai’s inauguration.
Chinese influence in entertainment industry and cultural exchange events has long been common form of propaganda. Beijing’s attempt to spread propaganda via entertainers now extends to online influencers, such as YouTubers. This diversification of tactics to include influencer marketing allows China to subtly integrate its messages into everyday content that people willingly consume.
Beyond its subtlety, this approach targets a key demographic: Taiwanese youth.Growing numbers of people in Taiwan, especially the younger generation, view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China. The use of social media influencers could subtly shape their perceptions and attitudes, from words of their favourite YouTubers.
“Beijing using influencers to impact Taiwanese society is a strategic move.”
To Learn More:“Taiwan: Beijing’s Global Media Influence Report 2022“,Freedom House
One prominent example isZhong Ming-Xuan(鍾明軒), a Taiwanese influencer with over a million followers. Zhong, became well-known for being political outspoken and supporting gay rights. Zhong further boosted his popularity by collaborating with former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen (蔡英文), DDP. Attracting many young Taiwanese fans and build a pro-Taiwan image.
However, in recent months, Zhong has frequently traveled to China, producing and posting videos. In his content, he discusses how “Taiwanese are also part of the Chinese nation” and has made comments about the “unacceptable” mindset regarding the Tiananmen Square incident when responding to readers. These statements have sparked heated debates on Taiwanese social media. Netizens question whether Zhong has become a partner in Beijing’s external propaganda efforts.
Followed by these developments, YouTuberPotter King(波特王) revealed that the Chinese government has been paying Taiwanese content creators to travel to China and produce videos favorable to Beijing. “Starting next month, people will begin seeing videos of Taiwanese YouTubers and other content creators traveling to attractions and historic sites in China, sharing positive views of their experiences to promote China to young Taiwanese,”he said. “About 10 production teams of some well-known YouTubers are participating in the campaign.”
Immediately a “witch hunt” occurred, with netizens trying to identify those involved in Beijing’s programme. Many influencers joined the debate, accusing Potter King of making baseless claims without direct evidence. Despite this, some Taiwanese influencers haveadmittedthey have once received invitations from China. Inviting them to participate in what is suspected to be part of aUnited Front campaign. This leads to a heated debate in Taiwan among political figures. Bringing the issue of Taiwanese influencers potentially being involved in China’s cultural propaganda efforts into the spotlight.
Part of the reason is that using influencers to targetTaiwanese youthis less coercive and more subtle. China’s soft power tactics have become multifaceted, unlike in the past when they primarily targeted theolder generation or spiritual followers. By showcasing the positivity of China, commentor worry these efforts canlureTaiwanese youth. China aims to create a favourable environment for its goal of reunification with Taiwan. The recent Bluebird Movement in Taiwan may offer some insights about such surging concern among Taiwanese society.
TheBluebird Movement(青鳥行動) is the most recent large-scale social demonstration in Taiwan since the Sunflower Movement in 2014. After the election, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), in partnership with the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), gained more seats in the Legislative Yuan. The Bluebird Movement protests were a response to a set of bills reforming legislative power, hastily passed by the Legislative Yuan. The KMT dismissed the protests and criticized international observers for their lack of understanding of Taiwanese politics.

The controversial reforms grant the Legislative Yuan more oversight and investigative powers.Criticsargue that the legislation is unconstitutional, infringes on civil liberties, and targets the incoming administration. The bills contain vague definitions and allow for mandatory summons to legislative hearings without the right to legal counsel. The protests were not merely against the perceived lack of transparency in passing the laws but also against the broader implications.
Since the KMT is reputed to be pro-China, some see these legislative changes as a pan-Blue power grab reminiscent of actions dating back to the authoritarian period, potentially influenced by China.Criticsargue that these moves erodes Taiwan democratic value and sovereignty. It could also serve China’s interests. The movementagainst the pan-Blue camp’s power grabhas gradually been termed the Bluebird Movement.
Beijing’s recent tactics to exert influence over Taiwan have evolved to become more multifaceted and strategic. The controversy surrounding the use of influencers and the broader implications of these methods underscore the ongoing struggle for Taiwan’s sovereignty amidst persistent external pressures.

Amidst the boiling world tension, China is rapidly increasing its nuclear stockpile, making it possess the fastest-growing nuclear arsenal. The recent satellite images revealed that hundreds of additional silos are being built acrossNorth-Central Chinato accommodate the ever-expanding stockpile of nuclear missiles. Though such a trend might be perceived as normal for a revanchist state like China, this is directly opposed to the traditional approach of China’s nuclear doctrinal thought aimed at an absolute minimum deterrence capacity. Thus, the situation posed a crucial question: why has China embarked on its nuclear frenzy now? This raised two questions: First, what factors contributed to China’s threat perception which pumped its rapid nuclear expansion; second, judging from China’s current revanchist goal to claim Taiwan, how the increased China’s nuclear deterrence capacity might affect the US strategists?
To answer the first question, we have to examine Chinese nuclear deterrence thoughts since its inception, and how these have been affected by the external security environment in recent decades. This endeavor will heavily rely on the grey literature: publications and opinion pieces by Chinese authors through RAND Corporation publications. And for the second question, will be based on the testimony by Caitlin Lee, senior Political Scientist, presented before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which highlighted a list of concerns by the US strategists.

On China’s Nuclear Doctrine
China, when compared to other nuclear states, got its hands on nuclear weapons relatively late; it only began to test its first nuke in 1967. Before that, China often showed a dismissive attitude toward nuclear capacity, which could be traced back toChairman Mao Zedong’s viewof such weapons as nothing less than a “paper tiger”. This attitude would later change, as US officials excessively employed the nuclear retaliation threat to deter Chinese military venture across the 1950s, from the Korean War to the first Taiwan trait crisis. Subsequently, these events incentivized China to develop its warhead as a response. However, unlike the US, which seriously experimented with the theory of how to incorporate nuclear weapons in bothits tactical and strategic warfighting capacity, Chinese strategists thought of nuclear weapons in terms of a political tool on the international stage.
This was reflected in the period after the first nuclear detonation test which was marked bya minimal increase in the warhead. Meanwhile, the military service that holds majority control over the nuclear weapon,the Second Artillery Corps, received neither political nor economic attention when compared to the big three Chinese military triads; People Liberation Army (PLA), People Liberation Air Force (PLAF), and People Liberation Navy (PLN). Initial Chinese thought emphasized two concepts: the no-first-use policy and second-strike capability; the latter aim is to inflict damage on the enemy’s economic activities, and military command, hoping to maximize the psychological effect, to make China anorexia for the nuclear strike. This notion was supported by the remark ofthe Chinese Premier Zhou Enlaiin 1957, which stated that China’s nuclear development should aim to resolve the nuclear threat, not be solely a nuclear arms race.

Why does China increase its nuclear capacity now?
In 2015, the Second Artillery Corps was elevated from the service under the PLA to being its ownmilitary branchequal to the PLA and PLN; this signaled an increased commitment of China to nuclear weapons. This move was also accompanied by the rapid expansion of the nuclear stockpile and the modernization of its delivery system. There are two main explanations for this erratic behavior: changes in the external security environment, and China’s growing status on the world stage.
First, on changing the external security environment. Before the 2010s, Chinese writers and academics usually described the environment surrounding China as acalm and stable regionwith minimum prospect of conflict. This attitude changed around the beginning of the 2010s when Chinese authors attributed thedisturbance of peacein China’s periphery area to the ever-increasing provocative actions taken by its neighboring countries which infringed on China’s territorial rights. For example, Japan’s effort to nationalize the disputed Senkaku Islands. However, a particular emphasis was placed on enclosing U.S.-led alliances, and the deployment of the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) on its allied soil. It was this BMD system that troubled the Chinese analysts the most; the system can neutralize China’s second strike capacity, thus, compromising Chinese nuclear doctrine.
Second, Chinese analysts believed that the cause of the increasing antagonizing behavior displayed by the U.S. originated from the narrowing down ofthe Sino-U.S. power balance. Subsequently, the U.S. is trying to scramble strategies to contain China’s rise, which will threaten the U.S. hegemonic position on the world stage. To amend this, Chinese analysts argued, China must increase its power to reach a certain threshold that makes the U.S. feel that its containment strategy is unsustainable, thus leading to a policy of accommodatingChina’s rise. For this reason, Nuclear weapons are viewed as a political tool to create a perception of strength, forcing U.S. strategists to reconsider their foreign policy approach toward China.

What’s next?
Assessing the variables above, it can be postulated that China will keep enhancing its atomic stockpile both qualitatively and quantitively as a reaction against what Beijing may perceive as provocative neighbors. Meanwhile, the no-first-use policy is increasingly being omitted from variousrecent Chinese white papers, making the experts believe China is hinting at the possibility of using its nuke to defend its territorial claims. In this case, China will likely use its nuclear threat to deter a possible U.S. intervention in the future Taiwan Strait crisis, or if it fails, then China can still use a threat to delay U.S. military aid.
On the technical side, China will try to devise a way to counter the BMD system in order to restore the second strike capacity; the obvious route is to overwhelm the system with sheer numbers of missiles. In this scenario, the multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) will be deployed in higher numbers in the coming years. However, more subtle methods might also be considered, for example, China can pour more resources into its hypersonic missile research, hoping that its speed will be superior to that of BMD.

Despite the fear of a new nuclear arms race, all evidence indicated that China is only looking for limited deterrence rather than nuclear parity with the U.S. Assuming that the second strike capacity is being fully restored, the U.S. would not be able to use its nuclear capacity to blackmail China. In this regard, China would maintain a limited number of Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) that can reach U.S. soil; the numbers would be high enough to cause a psychological effect on the U.S. planners, but insufficient for true annihilation.

On future Taiwan Strait conflict
In a way, China’s nuclear weapons garnered concern among U.S. planners. They realized that they could not use the maximum forces when combating China or making unnecessary strikes against the Chinese homeland, which could result in nuclear escalation. This uneasy scenario is forcing the U.S. to forge a subtle strategy that aims to coerce China to negotiate. The U.S. planners came up with the concept of “deterrence by denial”. This strategy aimed to inflict massive damages on Chinese invasion forces, which would convince China that victory was likely untenable and too costly, thus agreeing to settle a war on the negotiating table. If such a retaliation attack on the invasion forces was not sufficient, the strategy calls for the strike of limited numbers of China’s military assets along the coastline. The logic behind this strategy is that the U.S. must coerce China into the negotiating table as quickly as possible since the prospect of a protracted war can generate tension, which may eventually spiral down into Nuclear exchange.

Will Russia Pay for Ukraine’s Reconstruction? Analysing European Regulation on Utilising Extraordinary Net Profits from Frozen Assets,"The European Union’s more powerful arm against Russia for the Ukraine invasion is without doubt the sanction power. The restrictive measures packages against relevant persons, companies, and agencies from Russia are the most prolific sanctions regime in its history. The 14th package of sanctions against Russia was adopted on June 24, 2024. But hand in hand with sanctions, new problems and questions have arisen, such as sanctions circumvention and the use of the extraordinary net profits from frozen assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction.

Thewar in Ukrainehas glowing recentdiscussions over the legalityof permanently confiscating assets frozen under financial sanctions. Somepoliticiansare pushing for the introduction of measures that would permit states to confiscate assets because governments have passed a decision to freeze them under a sanction mechanism. Afterwards, these funds will be used to compensate the victims of the sanctioned target.
According toEuropean Union sources, there are around €210 billion of resources from the Central Bank of Russia which have been frozen in the European member states. These resources generate revenues due to the high increase in interest rates. For a long time,the bosom of the EU debatedabout how to use this profit to help Ukraine in its reconstruction and to overcome the effects of war.
Source:Council of the EU and the European Council
The first movement to go this way was the Council’s adoption of thedecisionclarifyingthe obligations of Central Securities Depositories (CSD)holding assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) that are immobilised due to the EU’s restrictive measures. The EU prohibited any transactions related to the management of reserves and assets of the CBR.
Moreover, the Council decided that CSDs holding more than €1 million of CBR’s assets must account for extraordinary cash balances accumulating due to EU restrictive measures and keep corresponding revenues separate. According to some estimates, re-investments of these cash incomeshave generated more than €5 billion in profits for the CSDs. In addition, CSDs shall be prohibited from disposing of the ensuing net profits. This decision adopted in February left the door open for new regulation regardingthe use of these net profits.
Finally, the EU approved theCouncil Regulation (EU) 2024/1469which authorises the use ofnet profitsfrom the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia to support Ukraine’s recovery, reconstruction, and self-defence against Russia’s war of aggression. The first key element to understand this new regulation is the concept of “net profit”. Commonly known, the most popular form of the European restrictive measures is the financial sanctions:frozen assets in the European banks and financial institutions. However, in the European arena,it should not be confused with confiscation, which implies the existence of a prior court-approved judgement.Asset freezing is only a preventive measure.For this reason, persons targeted by a financial sanction do not lose the property of the capital. The EU does not confiscate the frozen assets, it will use only the benefits generated for them.

In international practice other solutions have been adopted, for example, Canada and the United States have designed systems for confiscating Russian-linked funds.Canada’s Special Economic Measures Actincludes provisions for the repurposing of funds and empowers the government to use confiscated funds for various purposes. These include thereconstructionof a foreign state adversely affected by a grave breach of international peace and security; therestoration of international peace and security; and thecompensation of victimsof a grave breach of international peace and security, gross and systematic human rights violations or acts of significant corruption. Similarly, theUS introduced a billthat permits the government to confiscate Russian-linked funds under sanction and use them for the benefit of the people of Ukraine.
Recital 26 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1469 stipulates that CSDs holding assets and reserves with a total value of more than €1 million will be required to make a financial contribution out of their corresponding net profits.This is equivalent to 99.7 % of such accumulated net profits as from 15 February 2024.The payments will be made every six months until the central securities depositories no longer have excess profits on their balance sheets. This cessation of excess profits is expected to occur when the restrictive measures, which currently prohibit transactions with the assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia, are lifted.
Moreover, Annex XLI of this regulation sets that the amounts transferred shall be allocated to Union expenditure instruments supporting Ukraine. Thus, 100% will be transferred to theUkraine Facility. In addition, in order to respond to unforeseen situations or new developments and needs, annual deviations up to a maximum of 10 % shall be possible.
After the adoption of the 13th package of sanctions, theRussian Foreign Ministry affirmedthat the sanctions of the European Union were illegal, undermining the international legal prerogatives of the UN Security Council. In line with the statement, Russia expanded the blacklist of European citizens who are prohibited from entering Russia for providing military assistance to Kyiv, as well as individuals involved in the freeze of Russian state assets. The list of targeted individuals included representatives of the Council of Europe, members of legislative assemblies of European Union countries, members of theOSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and theParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe(PACE).
The European Union is showing a big commitment to the European sanctions regimes. It is the cornerstone of its foreign policymaking. In this way, it covers all sides of the sanctioning phenomenon, and this latest step is certainly an ambitious one: the use of net profits from Russian frozen assets. However, the European position is more cautious than that shown by other G7 countries such as Canada or the United States. The EU is not talking about confiscation but about the net benefits of capital, but when sanctions are lifted the capital will be returned to the owners.","August 02, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/russia-pays-for-ukraines-reconstruction/,María Vallés González,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: Italy Protects Made In Italy Label,"When people think of luxury brands, they expect that the products are quality, potentially involving a complex manufacturing process. Recently in Italy, the uncomfortable truth has been uncovered.Dior and Armaniare in trouble with the Italian government over allegations of paying third parties who exploit immigrants to manufacture handbags. Immigrants are allegedly paid as little as 2-3 euros an hour, and both brands pay less than 100 euros to have each bag manufactured, a far cry from what many expect when paying thousands for a handbag. Dior bags with a retail price of 2,600 euros had a manufacturing cost of only 56 euros (excluding the cost of materials). While it is not a surprise that companies charge more for goods than it costs to produce them, it is still a shock regarding what a small percentage of the price of the bag is the manufacturing cost. This has also raised doubts about the quality of the bags and the possibility that consumers are simply paying a high amount for the brand name.
Armani and Dior did not directly exploit these workers, instead, they subcontracted the work toChinese-owned firmsbased in Italy. The national government maintains that while this may be the case, it does not absolve either company from the responsibility of ensuring that workers involved with the manufacturing process are fairly treated.  These firms prepared workers without a work visa to tell officials who conduct inspections of working conditions that they were actually not employed by the firms, despite evidence demonstrating that they in fact were working for the firm.
In order to ensure that the problems regarding working conditions are fully resolved, Dior and Armani will be placed underjudicial administration. The Italian government is also concerned with ensuring that there is free competition in the market. When companies use illegal practices in order to produce goods at a cheaper price, this risks pushing out firms who follow the law and consequently earn less money. In a capitalist economy, companies are expected to compete, yet this becomes difficult to do so if the only way to compete is to break the law, as Dior and Armani have allegedly done.
Under Meloni, the Italian government has been working to protect the ‘Made in Italy’ label. The government also finedDR automobiles, an automaker based in the region of Molise for selling Chinese cars as Italian made. The automaker essentially sells Chinese cars with an Italian car brand badge attached to them. This is an issue as while consumers may have thought that they were buying an Italian made car, they were in reality buying Chinese cars as DR deceptively hid the origin of the vehicles. This could also damage the ‘Made in Italy’ brand if problems arose with the vehicles despite not actually being Italian. Products made in Italy are associated with high quality and the Italian government has an economic interest in protecting this reputation. In order to discourage this behaviour, the brand will have to pay asix million euro fine. Stellantis, the parent company of FIAT, no longer places the Italian flag on FIAT 600s which are produced in Poland after being accused of misleading consumers as well.
Protecting the integrity of products made in Italy is a priority of the Italian governance considering how important exports are for Italy. With over 500 billion euros worth of products exported every year, Italy is the six largest exporter worldwide. What helps Italian products be so well known worldwide are thefour As, abbigliamento (clothing) arredamento (furniture), e automazione (machinery and transportation). Besides ensuring that companies do not abuse the ‘Made in Italy’ brand, the nation must figure out how to improve productivity, incentivize innovation, and reduce ant-industrialization sentiments in Italian society.
While it may anger people to realize how little workers were allegedly paid to produce bags for Dior and Armani, the reality is that Italy will likely not be able to prosecute these brands for low pay. Instead, the national government will have to focus on poor working conditions. This is because Italy is one of thefew European Union member statesthat does not yet have a minimum wage. While the extremely low hourly pay of 2-3 euros is being mentioned while reporting this story, it is unlikely that this will be a main point for holding Dior and Armani legally responsible for poor working conditions. Instead, this fact may help explain why these brands have partially been able to become so successful, compared to smaller brands.
Regardless of the absence of a minimum wage, bad working conditions were already discovered. Some workers weresleepingat the factories in order to produce handbags during the night. The government was also able to access documentation showing electricity consumption which proved that handbags were in fact being produced not only at night, but also during national holidays. Workers also were not provided protective eyeglasses in order to prevent fragments from damaging their eyes, along with exposure to dangerous machinery.
Nations need to ensure that companies do not exploit workers, regardless of citizenship status. Consumers also need to be more careful and realize that simply paying a higher price does not mean that a product was ethically produced. This is unfortunately not the first time that Italy has uncovered abhorrent working conditions, nor will it likely be the last. It is important to enforce legislation regarding worker rights not only to protect the workers which are actively being exploited, but to also protect the integrity of the economy and not allow companies which do not participate in these illegal practices to be forced out of the market. There is a significant risk that brands which treat employees fairly will struggle to compete with brands that do not, as they can sell their merchandise at a lower price.

Beirut’s unanswered cry for Justice: four years after the 2020 explosion,"On 4thAugust 2020, 6h07 pm, the largest non-nuclear explosion in history shattered the surroundings at the port of Beirut killing over 200 people, injuring 7,000 others, and devastating 77,000 buildings. Since then, the families of the victims have been doing sit-ins on the 4th of each month to demand justice, justice that remains elusive, whether on a local or international level.The investigation is stalling.
“August 4th did not just destroy the port. It destroyed our lives,” declares the daughter of one of the explosion victims. “The government ignores us, private initiatives keep our heads above water and give us hope.” Indeed, since the tragedy, many funds have been raised to help families in need. Other NGOs have emerged following the tragedy, such as theKrystel El Adem Foundation, named aftera young womanwho lost her life that day. The pain is unimaginable. The struggle seems eternal. And Lebanese people are still trying to make peace with the event.
Let’s go back to the source of the tragedy.
“MV Rhosus”, a general cargo ship was abandoned in Beirut, Lebanon, after its charterers lost interest in the cargo and the ship was deemed unseaworthy. The ship’s 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate were seized and brought ashore in 2014. These materials subsequently played a role in the devastating2020 Beirut explosion. The fundamental reasons behind this catastrophe are still mostly unknown.Why was the cargo ship in Beirut? Was the shipment really abandoned or was it left on purpose?
The journey of the cargo ship began in Georgia in 2013, carrying ammonium nitrate with Mozambique as the final destination. It stopped in Beirut to pay for the Suez Canal passage. To cover these expenses, the ship’s owner requested to add an additional shipment. As a result, the already overloaded Rhosus cracked and was abandoned at the port of Beirut. According to Lebanese law, if no one claims a cargo after six months and one day, the customs authorities become the owners. This is what happened in this case.
To whom did the ammonium nitrate belong?The owner of the cargo was registered in the UK under the company “Savaro Limited,” which turned out to be a shelf company.Firas Hatoum, an investigative journalist, discovered that two entities were hiding behind this company, both run bytwo Syrian-Russian businessmen. The brother of one of them was under U.S. sanctions for attempting to bring ammonium nitrate into Syria in 2013.
Let’s not forget the political context inSyria in 2013: war was raging, but it faced significant challenges in sustaining itself. The use of chemical weapons was explicitly forbidden by theU.S. in 2012for the Syrian conflict. The only way around this prohibition was through Lebanon. There is an obvious link between all these factors, yet nothing directly proves Syria’s involvement in the matter or identifies the true owner of Savaro, and thus the ammonium nitrate. It all remains a mystery.
Why did the authorities not act directly when the ammonium nitrate was at the port?They failed to properly identify the nitrate for months. Despite numerous alerts and warnings between 2013 and 2020, they were informed but did not take action. Hangar 12, where it was stored, was in poor condition. The army was notified but responded that it did not want it. No inventory was conducted to determine if the entire quantity was still there. All these factors highlight the negligence and poor management of the government and how terribly they handled the situation.
Some things to keep in mind: the authorities forbade rescuers from abroad (Limoges and the Netherlands) from entering the blast site. The families of the victims were forbidden to search for survivors at night because “there were no lights.” When unarmed civilians peacefully protested for days afterward, they were shot with live ammunition. And many such incidents occurred.
Why did the container of ammonium nitrate explode?A lot of people heard planes, but the international community dismissed this idea entirely, calling it an “accident,” making the Lebanese think it was all in their heads, a product of their imagination. At a Lebanese level, the rule of law has become a joke. Four years have passed, and no one has been held accountable.The wounds are still open and bleeding more than ever.
The Beirut explosion was not just a tragic accident; it was a devastating event that exposed the deep-seated issues of negligence, corruption, and impunity withinLebanon’s political and administrative systems.Four years later, the pain and loss remain raw for the families of the victims, who continue to fight tirelessly for accountability. Despite their relentless efforts, justice remains a distant dream, as local and international authorities fail to bring those responsible to account.
The unanswered questions surrounding the MV Rhosus, the mishandling of the ammonium nitrate, and the broader geopolitical implications only add to the sense of injustice and betrayal felt by the Lebanese people. Each sit-in, each protest, and each plea for justice is a testament to the resilience and determination of the victims’ families and the wider community.
This tragedy also serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for systemic reforms in Lebanon. The international community must support these efforts, ensuring that such a catastrophe never happens again. The Beirut explosion is a scar on the nation’s history, but it also represents a call to action for a better, more accountable future.
As we remember the lives lost and the countless others forever changed onAugust 4, 2020, we must continue to demand justice, transparency, and reform. Only then can the wounds begin to heal, and only then can the hope for a brighter future be realized. The struggle is far from over, but the spirit of those who continue to fight for justice will not be extinguished.

(Analysis) The Aftermath of Bolivia’s Failed Coup Attempt – Was It a Coup or Something Else?,"In June 2024, Bolivia faced a dramaticcoup attemptled byGeneral Juan José Zúñiga,targetingPresident Luis Arce. This incident starkly highlighted the deep-seated political and economic tensions that have been brewing in the country. The coup attempt, which Arce’s supporters branded as a direct assault on democratic governance, was met with a contrasting perspective from former President Evo Morales, wholabeled it an “auto-golpe”or self-coup, reflecting the polarized interpretations of the event.
General Zúñiga, who was rumored to be on the verge of dismissal, led a faction within the military in a brief and chaotic struggle for power. The coup attempt, however, failed to gather significant support from other military factions or opposition forces and was quickly subdued within hours.This rapid collapse left many observers questioning the motivations and authenticity of the attempt, with some speculating that it might have been a strategic move by Arce to consolidate his own position amidst declining approval ratings.
The failed coup attempt was marked by confusion and conflicting narratives. General Zúñiga’s faction managed to seize control of key military installations temporarily but struggled to secure broader support. The operation was chaotic, with unclear objectives and a lack of coordination among the coup plotters. The swift response from loyalist forces and the absence of significant backing for the coup contributed to its rapid failure.In the aftermath, various interpretations emerged since General Zúñiga claimed that:
“On Sunday I met with the president and the president told me, ‘The situation was very f*****, that this week would be critical. And so, it’s necessary to prepare something to bring up my popularity.’ And so he told me, he asked me, ‘Shall we take out the armored (vehicles)?’”Zúñiga told reporters, without providing any evidence.Arce’s supporters and government officials condemned the attempt as a blatant attack on democratic institutions. In contrast, Morales suggested that the coup might have been orchestrated or manipulated to serve Arce’s interests, positing that it was a self-inflicted move designed toboost Arce’s popularityand legitimacy. This theory, while speculative, reflects the deep divisions and mistrust between the factions within Bolivia’s political landscape.
Bolivia’s history is marked by frequentpolitical instability and military interventions. Since gaining independence in 1825, Bolivia has experienced nearly 40 coup attempts or successful coups. The period between 1964 and 1982 was particularly turbulent, characterized by a succession of military regimes that ruled with varying degrees of repression and instability.
The country transitioned back to democratic governance in 1982, and during the subsequent four decades, Bolivia managed to maintain relative stability in terms of democratic processes, albeit with significant political challenges. This era of stability was briefly interrupted by the 2019political crisisbut was notably marked by an absence of violent military coups until the recent 2024 attempt.
The events of 2019 were pivotal in setting the stage for Bolivia’s current political climate. Evo Morales, who had been in power since 2006, faced growing controversy over his bid for a fourth term. Despite a2016 referendumin which Bolivians voted against lifting presidential term limits, Morales decided to run for re-election, citing a court ruling that allowed him to do so.
The October 2019 election results, initially showing Morales securing a fourth term, were marred by allegations of electoral fraud. The Organization of American States (OAS) conducted anaudit and reported significant irregularities, leading to widespreadprotests and calls for Morales’ resignation. The report’s findings, combined with a suspicious pause in vote counting, fueled accusations of fraud.
Under immense pressure, Morales resigned and fled to Mexico, denouncing the events as a coup. His departure created a power vacuum, which was filled by Jeanine Áñez, a right-wing senator who assumed the interim presidency. Morales’ supporters and several international observersdenounced Áñez’s rise to power as illegitimate,exacerbating the political divide and contributing to Bolivia’s ongoing instability.
The economic conditions in Bolivia have played a crucial role in shaping the current political landscape. During Morales’ presidency, Bolivia experienced significanteconomic growthdriven by highcommodityprices, particularly natural gas.This period saw substantial reductions in the poverty rate and advancements in social equality, supported by various social programs and subsidies.
However, economic conditions began to deteriorate around 2014, following a decline in global commodity prices. The COVID-19 pandemic further strained Bolivia’s economy, compounding existing financial challenges. By the time Luis Arce assumed office in 2020, Bolivia was grappling with asevere economic downturnmarked by high inflation, a shortage of US dollars, and declining natural gas production.
Under Arce’s administration, efforts to stabilize the economy have faced numerous obstacles. The shortage of US dollars has led to difficulties in maintaining social subsidies and managing public finances.The economic crisis has exacerbated social inequalities, with rising living costs and fuel shortages contributing to increased social unrest.The reversal of economic gains achieved during Morales’ tenure has reignited concerns about poverty and inequality.
Evo Morales remains a highly influential and polarizing figure in Bolivian politics. His return to Bolivia after the 2019 crisis was marked by both renewed support and significant controversy. Morales continues to wield considerable influence through his leadership of the MAS (Movimiento al Socialismo) party and his connections with social movements, particularly the cocaleros (coca growers).
Morales’ criticism of Luis Arce and his attempts to mobilize political support haveexacerbated internal divisions within MAS. The factional split between “evistas” (Morales’ supporters) and “arcistas” (Arce’s supporters) has complicated party unity and governance. Morales’ potential candidacy for the 2025 elections adds another layer of tension, challenging Arce’s leadership and further dividing the party.
The deteriorating relationship between Morales and Arce reflects broader tensions within Bolivia’s political system. While Morales continues to advocate for social and economic policies that align with his legacy, Arce has pursued a more pragmatic approach focused on economic stabilization. This divergence in political strategies has fueled internal conflicts and weakened the MAS party’s ability to address Bolivia’s pressing issues effectively.
Luis Arce, as the former finance minister under Morales, assumed the presidency with the promise of continuing MAS’s progressive agenda. However, his presidency has been marked by significant challenges, including political infighting and economic difficulties. Arce’s approach to governance, characterized by a focus on economic stabilization and crisis management, has been overshadowed by ongoing economic instability and rising social discontent.
The tensions between Arce and Morales have been a central issue in Bolivia’s political landscape. Arce’s administration has struggled to reconcile the differing priorities within MAS and address the economic crisis effectively. The failed coup attempt in June 2024 has further strained Arce’s position, as the administration seeks to navigate both internal party conflicts and external political pressures.
Arce has used the coup attempt to bolster his position,presenting himself as a defender of democracy against destabilizing forces. However, his ability to capitalize on this situation is limited by ongoing economic challenges andcriticism from opposition groups.The effectiveness of Arce’s leadership and his administration’s ability to address Bolivia’s economic and social issues will be crucial in determining the country’s future stability.
The failed coup attempt in June 2024 has exposed deep fractures within Bolivia’s political landscape and raised critical questions about the future trajectory of the country. The internal divisions within MAS and the broader political instability underscore the challenges facing Bolivia as it approaches the 2025 elections.
The political rivalry between Arce and Morales, combined with the economic hardships confronting the country, suggests a turbulent road ahead. The internal conflicts within MAS and the weakened position of Arce’s administration create opportunities for opposition forces to exploit divisions and potentially regain power.
Giacomo Finzispeculates that if internal rivalries within the MAS (Movimiento al Socialismo) are not resolved, Bolivia might face a situation where both Luis Arce and Evo Morales contend for the presidency in the 2025 elections. This double candidacy could potentially open the door for the right-wing opposition to regain power. Finzi also highlights the significant impact of the recent coup attempt on Arce’s political standing, suggesting that it has severely undermined his position and weakened his leadership.
As Bolivia moves towards the 2025 elections, the ability of MAS to reconcile internal differences and address economic challenges will be crucial. The failed coup attempt highlights the need for effective governance and political unity to ensure the stability and prosperity of the nation. Addressing the economic crisis, managing political tensions, and maintaining democratic institutions will be essential for Bolivia’s future trajectory.
In conclusion, Bolivia’s political and economic landscape remains complex and fraught with challenges. The failed coup attempt serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing instability and the urgent need for effective leadership and governance. As the country navigates its path toward the 2025 elections, resolving internal conflicts, addressing economic issues, and reinforcing democratic institutions will be key to ensuring Bolivia’s stability and progress.
What role might younger generations and new political movements play in shaping Bolivia’s future political and social landscape?
What steps can be taken to rebuild public trust in Bolivia’s democratic institutions in the wake of the failed coup attempt and ongoing political tensions?
Will President Arce run for a reelection and, if so what are the implications of a potential double candidacy of Luis Arce and Evo Morales for the MAS party and the broader Bolivian political landscape?

Starmer’s Economic Blueprint of Change,"Starting in late 2021, the United Kingdom is experiencing an economic downward spiral. With the country’s worst cost of living crisis of the twenty-first century, citizens have dealt with rising energy prices and frequent industry workers strikes while their disposable income falls miserably.
The principle reason behind this crisis is inflation – an economic phenomenon owing to which the price of a commodity or a service rises gradually over time. Though inflation is not the cause of a cost of living crisis, the UK has sustained low wage growth since the financial crisis in 2007.
The second cause are various global political factors, which have adversely affected the domestic economy. The UK is a net importer of goods, including energy. But the COVID-19 pandemic restricted demands for oil and gas. The Russian invasion of Ukraine also disrupted supply chains, thus putting strain on limited power and food supplies. The third reason is Brexit. With high trade barriers, the UK plunged into inflation much faster than in the US or the EU.
Amid this crumbling cost of living crisis, the UK has seen a paradigm shift in the affiliations of the governing administration. The Labour Party won a landslide victory against the 14-year-long reigning Conservative Party, with Keir Starmer assuming the role of the UK’s new Prime Minister. With a new party leading the country, many anticipate substantial changes.
As the UK’s first-ever female Chancellor, Rachel Reeves echoed the same points in her maiden speech as originally highlighted by Starmer in February 2023. These pledges related to kickstarting economic growth have formed guidelines for the Labour government and consist of:
The perception of Labour among businesses has become favourable, as demonstrated with the cancelling of all the nationalisation plans. However, with nationalisation off the agenda, stricter regulations for UK businesses will occur.
Another policy area of prime focus for the Labour government is partnership with private investment, particularly in energy transition, infrastructure and technology. Proposals such as theNational Wealth Funduphold this approach. Capitalised with £7.3 billion, the fund will have the up-gradation of ports, steel industry, large-scale battery manufacturing, green hydrogen manufacturing, and carbon capture technology as the focal points.
Another one of the major commitments of the Starmer-led government is ensuring greater stability in business taxation. The manifesto lays out a plan to cap corporation tax at 25% for the parliamentary term, guaranteeing a sense of security and certainty to businesses for long-term plans of investment. Keeping the motto of stability, the government will also unfurl a new tax roadmap. This will involve a permanent full expensing system, allowing companies to reinvest and modernise themselves.
A top priority for Britain’s government is building robust infrastructure through its ten-year strategy, boosting investment, innovation, and technical development. Keeping it aligned with industrial and regional priorities, Labour seeks to strengthen connectivity by establishing nationwide gigabit broadband coverage. The government will also set up a newNational Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authorityto oversee large-scale projects and reduce delays and red tape. Moreover, Foreseeing the potential of digital infrastructure in the future, Labour has incorporated transitioning to electric vehicles.
Perhaps the most ambitious part of the infrastructure strategy is housing. Housing prices have skyrocketed in the UK in recent years.Studiesindicate that by 2030, nearly 1.7 million households will reside in unaffordable houses. With a staggering rise in the cost of living, rent prices will rise, thus pushing low-income families into a vicious circle of poverty.
Labour’s emphasis on social and affordable housing was a cornerstone of its election campaign. It set its target of building 1.5 million new homes. On July 30th, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner announced in a House of Commons statement the administration’s initiative to ‘build the homes we need’. This suggested along-term housing policyto turn its ambitious manifesto promises into a reality. The plan comprises bringing back the mandatory housing targets, which were previously scrapped by the Conservatives in December 2023, and reforming theNational Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).
Furthermore, Labour seeks to increase the involvement of local authorities and communities in the decision-making process, a deviation from the working strategy of the previous government. An appealing feature of the proposed plan is to usegrey belts– consisting of poor-quality land, car parks, and wastelands within the green belts. Inspired by the 1954 Labour government, the current administration strives to continue its legacy by building a new generation of towns on these grey belts. By deploying a dedicated task force, the party wants to identify the appropriate areas to achieve the target of 300,000 homes each year.
The current crisis in the UK is owing to a relatively smaller increase in their income as opposed to the price of goods and services. Labour, through its employment laws reform, aspires to change this scenario, bringing inclusivity to the table. The new plan includes support for the disabled and health-affected employees and job creation for skilled youth employment. It also puts forward legislation to improve working conditions through measures such as banningzero-hours contracts, access to enhanced parental leave and sick pay and reforming long-pending restrictions on trade unions. This will ensure the quality of employment and subsequent production is not compromised.
Keeping in consonance with increasing local involvement to reduce economic inactivity, the government has announced plans to reform thepoints-based immigration system. It envisions doing so by imposing stricter visa restrictions on immigrants and reducing reliance on them by engaging the domestic workforce through training programs.
There were six policy initiatives spread out in Labour’s manifesto to achieve their goal of economic growth, stability and development. During theKing’s speechheld on July 10th, certain key legislative commitments were announced to deliver these promises. These included the Office of Budget Responsibility bill to reform the UK’s fiscal structure, tax reforms to avoid tax evasions, anindustrial strategy, a new National Wealth Fund, and a plan to repeal the Trade Union Act 2016 and the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023 to empower trade union rights.
However, there are challenges ahead. Starmer has inherited a weak economy with sluggish growth and his promises are being deemed as far too ambitious. Since the 2016 Brexit vote, the UK economy has consistently underperformed. Thus, the Labour government wanting to make the UK the G7’s top-performing economy looks too far-fetched.
Moreover, the administration’s firm stance on retaining the existing tax rates might put financial constraints on the budget.  For instance, fulfilling the objective of building 300,000 homes a year is difficult. This is due to price rises of construction materials and the shortage of skilled workforce. The problem of public finances looks like the biggest hurdle since all the proposed projects require huge amounts of investment. Through direct and quick action on long-persisting issues, Starmer and his government has gained the trust of people. Whether they can retain this majority and deliver economic growth is something to be seen in the long run.

Austrian Parliamentary Elections 2024 – What does FPO’s win mean?,"With both parliamentary and national elections held within four months, 2024 has undoubtedly been a critical year for Austria. And in both cases, the far-right has emerged victorious. Herbert Kickl’s party has secured 28.8% of the vote, leaving the other two major parties, OVP and SPO behind at 26.3% and 21.1% respectively, in the September 2024 parliamentary elections.  Previously, the FPO won its first nationwide election in the June 2024 European Parliament elections with a vote share of 25.36%. This national and regional win of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) marks a significant shift in the EU dynamics as Austria prepares to join the likes of Germany, Netherlands, Italy and France in witnessing similar political outcomes. The political landscape of Austria has been marked by widespread dissatisfaction among its citizens concerning politics and politicians, mainly due to themishandling of the multi-crisesVienna has faced since 2019. This has led to polarisation among the masses and a victory for the FPO which has been successful in banking on the miseries of the public.
The FPO has had a controversial, turbulent relationship with the Austrian public and government since its inception. The party was founded as a liberal, anti-Kremlin organisation in 1956 by a group of former Nazi officials, with the first two party chiefs former members of the SS.  However, for over three decades the party fluctuated between extreme right and centrist politics, before ultimately solidifying its identity as an anti-elite, populist far-right party under the charismatic leadership of Jörg Haider. Haider pivoted the party’s rhetoric by focusing on issues such as sudden surges in immigration and capitalising on nationalistic sentiments and anti-EU discourse. The soaring popularity of Haider improved the party’s performance to 27.2% in the parliamentary elections of 1999. As a result, the party (as a coalition with the Austrian People’s Party, OVP) came to power in 2000, for the first time since its inception. Nonetheless, the FPO and its purportedly racist leadership were not welcomed with open arms within the EU and the party had to step down from its position soon after.
The FPO banks its popularity from two largely discussed ideologies in Vienna,nativismandeuroscepticism. Though not in the party’s agenda when it was launched, these topics became the face of the FPO under Haider’s premiership. Following in his footsteps, Herbert Kickl has adopted the agenda and heavily relied on the public’s dissatisfaction with these issues which is evident from the policies and programmes proposed in his party’smanifesto. On the issue of migrants, the FPO suggested a harsh concept of ‘remigration’ and stressed on the need of a remigration commissioner while relentlessly campaigning its slogan of ‘Fortress Austria’. Remigration refers to sending back asylum seekers to their country of origin, especially if they fail to integrate and assimilate with the Austrian rules and regulations.
Given that approximately 26.7% of the Austrian population includes residents with a foreign background, the government’s — and related political affiliations’ concerns — are justifiable, as a rapidly growing population puts an added strain on the country’s resources and services. Nevertheless, the FPO has time and again associated immigration with criticism of Islam, a tactic co-opted by the OVP to secure its position in domestic politics. The intermixing of a political affairs with religion has resulted in a racist and xenophobic environment for Muslims residing in the country. Sebastian Kurz, former Chancellor of Austria and chairman of OVP implemented policies allegedly targeted only at radical Islamists to reduce the scope ofpolitical islamin the country.  However, the impact of these policies on the Austrian Muslim population was indiscriminate. This has formed the FPO’s foundation and given a practical framework to its long preached philosophy.
The secondly widely discussed and equally vital point of contention is Austria’s EU membership. For the FPO, identity and freedom are of paramount importance. Therefore the idea of sharing its sovereignty with the EU does not go well with its goal. The party has often been seen aligning itself with groups such as ‘Patriots for Europe’ and idolising controversial figures such as Hungary’s Viktor Orban. Yet, the party limits itself to criticising the EU but stops short at arguing for Austria to leave the union. They advocate national decision-making in issues such as in the judicial arena. On the other hand, the member states of the EU have been sceptical of the government, often displaying their disapproval of the party and what it stands for.  In 2000, when it joined the OVP in a coalition, the EU headed by Portugal, the then holder of the union’s presidency, announced their refusal to cooperate with Vienna, retracting their backing for Austrian officials in an international organisation. This immediate and strict response corresponded with the EU’s stated core values of upholding liberty, equality, democracy, human rights, and rule of law.
The FPO’s proximity to the Kremlin is also a matter of concern. In 2014, the party called for an end to the EU sanctions towards Russia during its annexation of Crimea. In 2016, FPO became the first and only party in Europe to sign apartnership deal(Freundschaftsvertrag) with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party. In 2019, the FPO was at the centre of ascandalwherein former Austrian deputy chancellor and leader of the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ), Heinz-Christian Strache was caught providing large-scale public contracts to an alleged heiress of a powerful Russian oligarch in exchange for campaign support. Most recently, ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the FPO has been against the EU aidtoUkraine and the sanctions imposed against Russia.
Even though Kickl’s party has managed to secure the largest share of the vote, it does not necessarily mean that the FPO will successfullyform a government. To form the government, a party needs at least 92 out of 183 seats, which Kickl’s party falls short of as they currently do not hold a parliamentary majority and other parties have show reluctance to join them in forming a coalition. The OVP has strategically refused to collaborate with Herbert Kickl but has not opposed the possibility of a coalition with the party altogether. Given the current circumstances, it seems the most likely outcome that the OVP and FPO will form the government together,without Kicklin the picture.
Considering the election results, it is apparent that the Austrians have resonated with the message and core issues touted by the FPO, while caring little for the party’s controversial history. The FPO voters, like most supporters of the right-wing across Europe, are marred by economic shocks and the resulting social tensions. The feeling of economic insecurity experienced through unemployment and rising food and energy prices have fuelled the anti-immigration sentiment. Given the status quo of Austria, it seems that they donot have enough choiceto turn to any other party. However, the party’s approach to satisfy its citizens wants is questionable. Thenormalisation of racismand xenophobia is alarming, and the increasing hostility towards the regional bloc and closer ties with the Kremlin have put Austria in the spotlight. Moreover, as another country comes under the right-wing influence, the already divided EU arena becomes further complex and it may inspire such hardline parties and movements, thus testing the EU’s cohesion. Whether or not the FPO wins in forming the government, right-wing policies and politics continue to gain momentum.

Fold or Call: Is the Philippines’ POGO Problem a National Security Threat?,"Gambling is a well-known type of entertainment in which only the brave, or occasionally deranged, attempt to win big despite the great hazards. Of course, gambling has negative consequences, including addiction and, in particular, crime. However, in the Philippines, gambling has recently upset the country’s notion of internal safety and security–all thanks to Philippines Offshore Gaming Operators, or POGOs. As a disclaimer, this is a developing topic that has drastically altered in recent months. As a result, this article will not focus on current developments, but rather on the reasons behind the Philippine government’s reluctance to raise the matter as a national security danger, despite claims of corruption, subversion, criminality, and espionage.
POGOsare businesses that offer internet gambling services to customers outside of the Philippines. This classification became official in 2016 during the administration of formerPresident Rodrigo Duterte. Under the statute, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), a state-owned company responsible for regulating legal gaming practices, was tasked with overseeing POGO operations and revenue collection. Simply put, POGO was established to centralize the regulation of online gambling companies that have existed since 2003 and to increase PAGCOR’s revenue.
In mid-July 2024, theDepartment of Financestated that the yearly net cost of POGO operations was around PHP 99.52 billion, while the entire economic benefits are estimated at PHP 166.49 billion, of which PHP 60.68 billion were direct earnings. However, the DoF also reported a significant financial loss of around PHP 265.74 billion per year, mostly due to negative reputational risks affecting foreign direct investments (FDI). POGOsemployed25,064 Filipinos in 2023, which was at least 50% of the classification’s workforce. It also employed 22,000 to 40,000 foreign nationals in 2023, most of them being Chinese. However, the Philippine Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) stated that at its peak under Duterte, POGOs employed at least around180,000 to 200,000Chinese nationals. In addition, in 2019, the growth also led to China being ranked2ndin the number of tourists in the Philippines at around 1.74 million visits.
The reason for the influx of Chinese immigrants and tourists in the Philippines was China’scrackdownon online gambling in 2018, which forced away a big part of their gambling industry. Furthermore, Duterte’s openness to Chinese immigrants coincided with a new appeasement foreign policy towards China, which brought concern from theoppositionand70%of Filipinos.
However, several crackdowns, raids, and investigations, revealed many of these POGOs to have links to crimes such as scamming, murder, drug trafficking, kidnapping, sextortion, and others. Currently, there are 4,355 known victims of POGO-related crimes between 2017 to 2023. PAOCC also stated that around 200 illegal and unlicensed POGOs still operate in the country, despite the ban declared by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in June 2024. In addition, many of these POGOs were allegedly involved in corruption schemes with government officials and agencies at different levels. Investigations claimed that a former Cabinet official lobbied in support of POGOs, that these entities have insiders in the judiciary, and that Duterte’sformer spokespersonwas also implicated in these possible links.
Specifically, many of these links were attributed to the ongoing POGO case of the dismissed Mayor Alice Guo, known as Guo Hua Ping, which rattled the nation. In summary, Guo came to the Philippines with her family in the early 2000s from China with forged identities and documents. She, along with her siblings, ran several businesses, centered around suspicious activities, including POGOs. Guo later ran for mayor and won the 2022 elections, but was later dismissed in June 2024 amid a government probe to determine her POGO links. She was later arrested in Indonesia in August 2024 after fleeing the Philippines in secret in mid-July (Morales & Flores, 2024;Senate of the Philippines, 2024).
Allegations have also been pushed out by the country’s security and government agencies arguing these entities have ties to espionage engaged in surveillance. During a raid on the Guo-linked POGO complex in the province of Pampanga, police uncovered possible People’s Liberation Army military uniforms, medals, and firearms inside the premises. Many of these POGO buildings are also coincidentally found just outside major Philippine military installations, which have led to security officials describing these as possible Trojan horses. Among these locations is the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo which is surrounded by 3 POGO sites.
Never Bet into a Lock
This all leads to the question, why is this still not recognized as a national security threat? Lawmakers urged the country’s security agencies to elevate the issue as such. However, these agencies have rejected calls, stating that a need for further validation. To better understand this reluctance it is best to see the issue from the perspective of the security officials, which have similar approaches to arguments of the securitization theory.
Thesecuritization theorycan be best understood with the thought of security issues that can be labeled as such by a decision-maker, requiring immediate resolution after doing so. This typically happens when a “referent object” that needs to be protected is suddenly threatened by something, which can all be entirely subjective on what that object is. To prevent every single problem from turning into a security issue, proponents argued for categorizing issues depending on the threat to the referent object’s social, political, economic, military, and environmental spheres. In addition, the “audience”, or the population, must also beconvincedof the threat for the issue to be securitized.
When a Philippine senator inquired the National Security Council’s (NSC) head on their reluctance to raise the POGO issue as a national security threat, they stated that the nation’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, social cohesiveness, and political stability have not yet been affected. Instead, they tagged the problem as anational security concern, as the nation’s law enforcement and legal institutions have been cited for handling the situation well. In addition, the AFP assured that they were looking into thepossible threatsposed by POGOs, especially with espionage, but stressed that they do not want to cause any panic. What these statements show is that there is a desire to be careful in elevating the issue.
Note, as argued under the securitization theory, any problem that has been turned into a security issue allows decision-makers to skip normal procedures and use every extreme means available to resolve it. To recall, the Duterte Administration had identified the persistent issue of drug abuse and trafficking in the country as an urgent threat by using rhetoric. This led the country’s security agency to launch the controversial drug war that has killed between12,000 to 30,000people. In addition, thered-taggingcampaign was used to tag opposition groups for having links with the nation’s communist insurgents, resulting in the imprisonment and deaths of numerous people. Such examples are why other international relations fields have criticized the theory as being partly liable for the overreaction of decision-makers.
Further, securitizing an issue tends toovershadowother problems that may need equal or more attention, which could siphon resources to other prioritized matters. This was also a phenomenon that led to the deterioration of the country’s external defense capabilities, as it instead focused oninternal security threatsfor the past few decades. The POGO issue is also concurrent with the developments in the South China Sea Dispute, which the Philippines is facing. However, it is notable that China has been supportive of the efforts of the Philippines to uncover POGO-linked crimes. Withstatementsreiterating China’s stance against illegal gambling. There were alsoconcernsthat PAGCOR’s revenue may be significantly reduced, that the Philippine real estate sector would also lose PHP 100 billion, that 23,000 Filipinos would lose their jobs, and that banning POGOs may force these entities underground.
With these, the investigations on POGOs have exposed the glaring realities of the Philippines’ vulnerabilities in its security. However, there are still conflicting arguments between government and security officials on how to properly designate the problem as either a national security concern or a national security threat.  To reiterate, this situation is a fast-developing issue, with more things to possibly change. Despite the urgency and depth of the story behind the situation, the need for restraint in using extraordinary means to resolve the issue is much needed. What is ironically clear is that there is a lack of clarity in information. Wherein every new detail published may sway the perspectives of decision-makers towards either label. Just as what POGO was meant for gambling, the entire situation simply asks, who wants to fold or call?
Hence, leaves us with three of the following questions:","October 29, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/fold-or-call-is-the-philippines-pogo-problem-a-national-security-threat/,Bryan Kerr Marco,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Have Russian Sanctions Worked?,"With the war in Ukraine almost hitting the two year mark, Russia is now the most sanctioned state, with around 70% of assets in Russian banks being frozen. The US, EU and other Western states and organisations have placed numerous economic sanctions on Russia ever since the annexation of Crimea in 2014(BBC News, 2024).
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the UK and the US have banned Russian oil and natural gas imports, whilst the EU has banned seaborne crude oil imports. In February of this year, further sanctions were imposed following the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Alongside national sanctions, many Russian individuals have also been sanctioned, including numerous oligarchs and business people linked to the Kremlin, with their assets frozen and travel bans imposed. Russia’s economy shrank by around 2.1% in the first year of the war(BBC News, 2024).
This essay will focus on the economic sanctions placed against the Russian state, rather than those on specific individuals, and will look at why economic sanctions have become the punishment of choice by the West in this conflict and what that means for the conflict as it progresses.
Economic Sanctions
Economic sanctions have been the action of choice by the West in the past, with the international sanctions against Iraq in 1990 in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait being some of the most notorious, and controversial. What these particular sanctions did was show the ethical concerns – if they work, who do they impact? Several concerns about the humanitarian impact of the sanctions against Iraq resulted in theUN Resolution 706, allowing Iraq to trade its oil for approved goods such as food and medicine. The outcome of the sanctions against Iraq highlighted a key flaw in imposing economic sanctions. The civilians are often the ones that feel the impact of the first, through means such as lack of food, supplies and a quick decline in living standards, posing a human rights question of “Is this ethical?”
Economic sanctions are often considered by governments to be action without ‘action,’ acting decisively without military force.
The Russian Case
One argument is that the economic sanctions against the Russian state were an attempt by the West to show the Russian public the negative consequences of the invasion of Ukraine. But, with the Russian government having a clamp down on media across the country, including cutting off access to Facebook, the BBC and other international news sources. It seems a hard task to change the minds of the Russian public simply by putting the Russian economy under some pressure.
But, like many other cases of economic sanctions being implemented, the main desired outcome of these sanctions against Russia is to put pressure on their economy. However, in an attempt to restrict how much resources the Kremlin can put into the Russian war machine, the West has given the Russian government a way of ‘villanising’ them and victimising themselves, therefore giving further justification behind the need to invade and maintain a presence in Ukraine. Whilst this is not the only justification Russia is giving, it does support the Kremlin’s efforts to portray itself as a defender rather than an aggressor.
To understand the Russian case in point, the relationship it has with the West and the international community as a whole should be understood. The fall of the Soviet Union wasviewed by many Russians, including the government, as an embarrassment, and the end of their superpower status. Putin himself has made it clear that he viewed the collapse of the USSR as a tragedy. Nowadays, the Russian relationship with the West is, of course, a complicated one. The West views Russia as ‘aggressive’ and therefore acts defensively to protect its allies, whereas Russia views the West as ‘aggressive’ and therefore acts defensively to protect its interests.
The use of social media by official Russian accounts is a key insight into how the Kremlin wants to shape the current narratives around the war in Ukraine, and Russia’s place in the international community in general. By having a strong presence on social media, whilst simultaneously maintaining strong censorship of international media outlets within Russia, they have managed to form a narrative of the West and Russia that fits their justification of the war. The argument that the West are ‘destabilising’ the region through economic sanctions, as well as providing the Ukrainian army with military equipment, allows the Russian government to justify their actions in Ukraine as being ‘defensive’ rather than attacking. In addition to this, by promoting the West in a negative light, they improve their own image.
Ultimately, the economic sanctions against Russia may have put the country under some economic strain initially. However, in 2023 their economygrew by 2.2%with a predicted growth of 1.1% by the end of 2024, in part caused by their quick thinking by changing their buyers of oil and gas. The narrative the Russian government has created surrounding the sanctions has, quite effectively, allowed them to portray a negative image of those imposing them whilst giving themselves a reason to continue fighting. Whilst this doesn’t necessarily mean all economic sanctions end up in failure and it also should be highlighted that with time Russia may not be able to continue to survive with the amount of sanctions it has against it, it does beg the question of, if the economic sanctions were to have had a more serious impact on the Russian economy, would that be a positive outcome?

Interactive Dialogue:The Future Starts Now: Enhancing the global system for current and future generations
This session of Interactive Dialogues featured interventions that reflected on how a sustainable future is the only possible one, where Representatives treated climate action, gender equality and education opportunities as interconnected issues that are necessary to be dealt with at the global level. This was exemplified by the words of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Turk, that reminded us that justice, sustainability and peace are the only path forward as our capacity to extinguish all of humanity has reached unparalleled dimensions. He continued by remarking that we can rebuild and we can achieve a better sustainable future, but “we need to put an end to the conflicts that are putting an end to lives and hope”.Mafalda Duarte, Executive Director of the Green Climate Fund, focused her intervention on climate action, celebrating progress in clean energy, such as record-low solar energy costs and a 55% reduction in wind energy costs. However, she also warned that investments in sustainable energy have dropped by 20% since 2016, pointing to compounding crises like armed conflicts and COVID-19 recovery efforts. Duarte stressed that this downward trend must be reversed to meet global climate goals. The devastating effects of a failure in this sense was pointed out by the Foreign Minister of Comoros, who shared the devastating impact of rising sea levels and floods on his country, calling for international mobilization to build resilience against natural disasters.In his remarks, the President of Spain identified climate change, gender equality, and human rights as the three most critical challenges facing the world today. He called climate change an issue of “intergenerational justice” and argued for a financial architecture that ensures countries don’t have to choose between repaying debt and addressing climate crises. Spain also proposed electing the first female Secretary-General of the UN, underscoring the importance of gender equality. Expanding on the theme of gender equality, the Foreign Minister of Burundi proposed the establishment of a women’s investment bank as a strategy to tap into women’s economic potential and address inequality at its roots.Education was another crucial theme, as the Minister of Education for Slovakia discussed the “brain drain” phenomenon, where the country’s brightest talents leave due to limited opportunities at home. He stressed the need for better educational resources to prevent mass emigration. Dealing the issue from another perspective, UN Youth Secretary Felipe Pauller underlined that many young people remain excluded from global decision-making processes. He emphasized the  importance of meaningful youth involvement and the need for intergenerational dialogue, advocating for a more inclusive approach that recognizes the full spectrum of youth diversity.

Interactive Dialogue:Towards a Common Digital Future: Strengthening inclusive innovation and cooperation to bridge the digitial divides
The Interactive Dialogue “Towards a Common Digital Future” begins with very different stakeholders taking the floor and underlining how much the world is still digitally divided and what a great loss of public good opportunities this represents. The Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), points out that 2.6 billion people are still offline meaning that we have to align digital inclusion with the pace of digital transformation, especially if AI has the potential to mitigate 10% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.The Representative from Microsoft warns that the challenges that we are facing are complex and can be solved uniquely through a multi-stakeholder approach and digital transformation can drive progress to sustainable development only if it is trustworthy, safe and inclusive. It continues by reminding that AI can be a crucial tool, if not the only one, to diagnose promptly diabetes patiences or save lives in the  event of a natural disaster through satellite AI. In a world where 2.6 billion people are still not connected, the priority should be bridging this gap to allow every community to benefit from technology.Lawyers Hub brings forward an issue that they claim is often overlooked. A crucial point in the digital divide are Visas and Visa policies, as often a substantial amount of financial resources of startups in the Global South are employed in Visa applications in order to conduct fundraising in MEDCs. The Representative concludes his remark by saying that “we cannot have data that travels faster than people”.The Norway Representative stresses that digital public tools are essential to tackle climate change, the global health crisis and much more, but since there are still 600 million people in Africa without access to electricity we have to focus on bridging this technological and digital gap. The Digital Public Alliance is a great example, with 40 members, of how we can facilitate, discover and deploy source technology with the aim to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.

General Assembly Plenary Session 5:Day 2 of Summit of the Future
The 5th plenary of the 79th session of the General Assembly proceeds with various statements by member states. The conduct of the debate reaches a rich variety of themes all exploring one or more different aspects of the Pact for the Future, praising its aspirations and warning of the most pressing challenges. For instance the Ecuador President stressed how crucial it is to provide the sufficient opportunities to young people, as only in case of a lack of them they will resort to crime and violence, making pivotal decisive investments in improving access to education and job opportunity conditions.The President of Finland decisively underlined the current limitations of the SC that led the body to fail in preserving peace, its main mission. Thus he proposes three different reforms to address this deficiencies: include 5 more member states, one from Latin America, two from Africa and two from Asia; abolish the veto power for all members; if a member of the SC blatantly violates the UN charter, its voting rights should be suspended.The President of Slovakia decided to focus on challenges that lie ahead in the digital space. He advocates for a “digital humanism”, that should arise by developing online rules that reflect the ones of the physician world as “every freedom requires accountability”.From different small states, including San Marino, Cyprus and Micronesia, a common discourse emerged, which underlined how for these countries it is important, and thus how much they are committed, in funding multilateral agreements on the international stage, as for them international law is the only substantial safeguard. The President of Micronesia stresses the fact that for his country solving the climate crisis, which can only be achieved by multilateral cooperation, represents the only possibility of existence.

Summary of Day 1 of the Summit of the Future: Key highlights
And that’s a wrap for Day 1 of the Summit of the Future. Let’s take stock of what happened during an event-packed day of dialogue for the international community.The first day of the Summit of the Future took place yesterday, which opened its procedures with an amendment tabled by the Russian Federation that sought to reduce the scope of the Pact for the Future, accusing the West of seeking to create new obligations for the Global South while neglecting its previous commitments. At the same time, the Russian delegate criticized how the negotiations have been carried out for their alleged lack of inclusiveness and transparency, making the current draft ineffective and equal to a “vague declaration”. Subsequently Congo, holding the presidency of African Union’s Mission to the UN, presented a motion of no-action to the amendment on behalf of the African Group, stressing the urgency to adopt a united pledge for the future that could set a blueprint for future challenges regarding the climate crisis, the reform of the financial global system and digital governance. The motion of Congo passed with an overwhelming majority, but in addition  to the 7 votes against and 15 abstentions that did not show support or interest for the current Pact, it is important to stress that some of the countries that might have been present but not voting. In fact, among these 28 countries there are some of them that are either in tension with traditionally-dubbed “Western” member states or aligned with Russia, such as Venezuela, Serbia, El Salvador, Niger, Burkina Faso or the bulk of central Asian states.After its  adoption, the Secretary General Guterres hailed the Pact for the Future as the way to “bring multilateralism back from the brink” putting at the center of his speech the urgency to overcome the huge inequalities threatening sustainable development, to reform international institution such as the SC, and to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels. After the remarks of the Secretary General, three representatives of the youth delivered powerful  speeches that urged world leaders to act upon the spirit of the Pact. Mohammed Al-Muftah reminded how “as a society, we embrace each other” and as the Assembly listened to him, a person with disability, without prejudice and judgment, we ought to act to ensure the same treatment for the other billion people with disabilities. Niria Alica Garcia, passionately spoke about our collective duty to stop the current “scourging of Mother Earth” and the suffering of people in armed conflicts such as the one that is unfolding in Gaza. She reminds that there is still hope as we are still here, and how the future path must encompass listening indigenous people’s voices of which there is a frustrating lack of mention in the Pact. Finally, Monica Malith warned that ignoring the global disasters and refugee crises would only deepen the current state of global disorder, inciting youth leaders not only to “get degrees, but we must exemplify leadership […] leaving the youth and the refugees go unnoticed only slights our collective responsibilities.”.In the subsequent Interactive Dialogues and the continuation of the plenary session, many Delegates echoed the remarks of Guterres, calling for bold, swift and comprehensive reforms of the current international institutional and financial architecture. Especially among small countries and those with developing and emerging economies, a unified discourse emerged, signaling a broad consensus not only to affirm the text of the Pact, but to act decisively in its spirit. We remember in the Interactive Dialogue “Transforming global governance and turbocharging the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development”, a unity of intentions between the reflections delivered by the Representatives of the World Bank, IMF and WTO, and the speeches of countries such as Malawi, Liberia and Kenya. For instance, the latter called to bridge the financing gap necessary to achieve the SDG and reform development financing in order to prevent developing countries from risking defaulting. Similarly, in the “Enhancing multilateralism for international peace and security” interactive dialogue, almost every country stressed the need to reform the SC in order to be more representative, to prevent the veto power from hindering the GA works and ensure a more effective deployment of humanitarian aids and interventions. A more miscellaneous outlook featured in the continuation of the plenary session. In fact, some countries, such as Brazil and the Central African Republic, decided to put at the center of the debate calls for financial reforms or reflections regarding the achievement of SDGs, while others, such as Israel and Serbia, preferred to use the floor to bring forward unilateral agenda items loosely related to the state of sustainable development.

Interactive Dialogue: Enhancing multilateralism for international peace and security
The second Interactive Dialogue of the day features a vibrant discussion of the current challenges that the UN is facing in ensuring global peace and security. From different stakeholders and member states there is a general consensus that the current institutional structure has to change in order to reflect the current geopolitical realities. The speeches mainly revolved around three pillars: granting a more fair geographical representation within the Security Council; reform the Security Council procedures and veto power; address the current issues in delivering humanitarian aid. The variety of perspectives and solutions proposed shows at the same time a willingness to strengthen the UN capacity to build peace and a critical awareness that this capacity cannot be ensured by the current asset.For instance, the CEO of the International Crisis Group suggested working outside current institutional arrangements by forming coalitions of nations within the UN. These should address peacebuilding, peacekeeping, and general peace operations, possibly involving organizations outside the UN system to address both emerging and ongoing crises more effectively. Additionally she stressed the importance to strengthen African, Latina American and smaller states representation. This call was later central in speeches of the Representatives of Fiji, Nigeria, Slovenia, Latvia and Kyrgyzstan, who argued that enhanced multilateralism, key to solving the current security crises, could be achieved only by fairer representation.Then, the Delegate of Liechtenstein called to change the SC vetoing structure to ensure that when stalled it still allows the UNGA to act upon and exercise power on security matters, without hindering its works. Subsequently, the Iceland Prime Minister underlined the issue that the UN is currently struggling to provide timely and effective humanitarian aid, while the death count among humanitarians, journalists and other aid delivery personnel is increasing. These remarks were later echoed by the UNHCR Representative that warned that it is the seventh year in a row that displaced people figures are rising, and that humanitarian disasters can only be prevented if all humanitarians and development actors cooperate timely together from the start of a crisis.

Interactive Dialogue: Transforming global governance and turbocharging the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund proceeds with his intervention with mixed attitudes. On one side, she highlights the resilience that the world economy showed despite the recent years’ shocks, on the other she warns of the possible setbacks that global growth might experience, expecting an average growth of 3% over the next 5 years – less than before Covid. Four priorities are listed to reduce this risk and move towards a fairer financial system that can address the needs of developing countries: working with members on micro policies; leveraging financial strength to direct more to low income countries; helping countries to address their debt challenges; develop a more representative institutional architecture.As the dialogue continues some common themes and concerns are shared by African representatives, confirming the keynotes made by World Bank, WTO and IMF representatives and the concerns expressed by the Secretary General Guterres during the plenary. Some of the main issues raised addressed the great difficulties that LDCs are facing due to the risk of default due to debt obligations, 1 in 3 developing countries, or the need of a reform in the development financing. This impacts the ability of African countries to reach both the SDGs and a just climate transition as the President of Malawi remarks “Developing countries can’t speed up while their legs and hands are being tied”, emphasizing the need of an entire reform of the global financial architecture especially with regard to LDCs that are being left behind, struggling to adequately leverage international financial markets.

Newsroom Conference Rapporteur, TNGO
The Interactive Dialogues get started with representatives of the World Bank, WTO, and the IMF presenting the latest insights and information regarding the SDGs next priorities for future accomplishment. In particular they stress out that 70% of the SDGs aren’t on target, 17% which are deemed accessible since 2015. To succeed in future accomplishment is necessary to bridge the financing gap for development and a spending gap of 40% of the GDP, while reforming the governance to ensure more inclusive and accountable and transparent decision making processes. At the same time, it is key to implement reforms that allow for debt relief initiatives to be tailored to the unique circumstances of developing countries.The Director General of the WTO stresses: “We need not just more trade but better trade.” This is because only with open global trade, and by boosting economic growth from deeper local trade ties we managed to lift 1.5 billion out of poverty. In the same way we should bring the poor communities left in the margins to the forefront through a “reglobalization”.

General Assembly Plenary Session 3:Opening of the Summit of the Future
The plenary session starts again in the afternoon with several speakers taking the floor reacting to the new resolution adopted and giving their vision on the future of SDGs and the path to achieve them. Despite the general message that there is more than unites than divides us, the debate at times was permeated by unilateral priorities on the current state of international affairs. For instance, the President of Serbia decided to focus on family and traditional values that should be protected from the so called “woke” cultural movement, while the Representative of Israel declared that SDGs accomplishment should not happen at the expense of the fight against terrorism and terrorist organizations, making both little to none mention to their progress and commitment to SDGs and to the Pact.On the other side, speeches such as the one of the Representative of the Central African Republic, that highlighted the necessity to affirm the Pact and the SDGs through strengthened multilateralism in order to avoid being neglected due to increased polarization and growing unrest, gave crucial importance to the path drafted by the adopted resolution stressing the importance of bold institutional reforms such as the one of the Security Council.

The General Assembly plenary segment of the UN Summit of the Future set the tone for the discussions ahead with the adoption of the much-anticipated “Pact of the Future.” Garnering 143 votes in favor, 7 against, and 15 abstentions, the Pact signifies a bold step toward reimagining global cooperation in an era of increasing fragmentation. The Secretary-General, António Guterres, delivered a powerful message, emphasizing the need to revive and strengthen multilateralism, which he said is “on the brink.” This declaration underscores the urgency of reforming international institutions to better address global challenges.Source: UN Photo/Evan SchneiderIn a moving address, Ms. Malith, a youth representative from South Sudan, spoke about her personal journey from a refugee to an advocate on the world stage. She warned that neglecting the pressing issues of global disasters and refugee crises would only deepen the current state of global disorder. Her poignant reflections highlighted the critical role of international support in transforming lives, and she urged leaders to not only support education for the youth but also to foster leadership and active engagement. As she put it, “It is not enough to get degrees, but we must exemplify leadership […] leaving the youth and the refugees go unnoticed only slights our collective responsibilities.”The Summit’s opening clearly indicates a shared commitment to reshaping the future of global governance. However, the polarized vote on the Pact reflects persistent divisions among member states. As discussions continue, it will be crucial to see how these differences are navigated and whether this summit can truly catalyze the multilateral revival that Guterres has called for.

European Affairs: Children’s Rights in Iceland,"Internationally153 million children are orphans. Only1% of these children will be adopted. The unfortunate reality that millions of children will be without care illuminates the great necessity for an effective youth welfare system. Especially when these children are more susceptible to alcohol and drug use compared to non-orphaned youth. InEastern Europe, 60% of girls who are orphaned will be trafficked, while 70% of boys will become criminals. Others may suffer from psychological conditions leading to suicide. The vulnerability of children is a necessary component when looking at the methods taken by governments to address children’s rights.
In general, children rest in a position where they are unable to have a tangible effect on the government. Regardless of the integration of youth voices, there still remains a distinct inability for children in marginalized positions (orphaned, without parental care, or disabled) to participate in a meaningful way that elevates their needs. Yet, children’s rights have internationally been recognized as an integral component to society. With 196 countries having signed onto theUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child(CRC), numerous nations have ubiquitously committed themselves to ensuring the security of children. Yet, millions of children remain without parental care, institutionalized, or cared for by the child and youth welfare systems. Globally,governments have implemented guidelines for these systems, with Luxembourg, Thailand, and Iceland all ranking highly in potential.
The importance of human rights and its development in a nation’s legislation present the quality of its system for children’s care.Health, education, protection, and dedication to protecting children’s rights are all factors taken into account when analyzing the performance of countries. Providing security to children insofar as halting child labour, accessing clean water and sanitation, continuing education, and enshrining the interests of children are a few necessary steps to improving the quality of life for children. Investigating the mentioned actions by the nation allows for the possibility to end the cycle that children in foster care or orphaned are susceptible to.
Iceland’s child and youth welfare system involves a collaborative approach that marries the national services with the community-based care in the local municipalities. The mingling of the two systems bolsters the ability to provide the most effective care. The Icelandic government strengthens the local and national child protection services through extending counseling to elected committees, continuing development of the protection of children, and conducting check-ins on institutions and homes. The facilities that exist for providing care to children are small (6 children to a household) to ensure that the necessary degree of support is available. Moreover, education and recreational activities are emphasized in long-term facilities. Improvement of care was initiated by the creation of three levels of services:the primary, secondary and tertiary. The primary level specializes in the assistance of all families to secure the success of the children, including health care, education, social services, and extracurricular activities. Secondary services help in professional manners to create a plan for the development of the child. This is a systematic level of support that is exterior to basic care that assists with the needs of a child. Tertiary services are those that are implemented when stopping recurrence of endangerment.
The major change to the positionality of children comes from theProsperity Actthat was brought into force in 2022. The aims for the act were toprovide access to necessary services and guarantee Iceland undertook its obligations under the CRC. Additionally, the act includes provisions for other activities, such as the need to “monitor…and evaluate” the implementation of the act, “respond effectively… to needs”, and conduct consultations to establish the proper procedures are being taken.
Children returning to their family of origin is a primary focus of the Icelandic foster care system. Whether or not children are placed into long-term care, the aims of the institution remain the same. This intention prioritizes the child’s needs and does not leave them behind. One illustration of this concept takes the form of theBarnahus, which is a multidisciplinary system that engages with numerous agencies to minimize the impact on children that may be in an insecure environment——most commonly due to violence. When conducting interviews of children, they include every aspect of the process, such as law enforcement, child protective services, the representative of the child, and mental health services. This reduces the amount of stress on kids in violent situations by having them do one comprehensive interview without a need to repeat the procedure.
Additionally, collaborative work that includes the participation of children in the foundation of the laws around foster care improved the actions taken by the state. In 2019, the youth were invited to participate in the production of government policy. In conjunction with international organizations, the proposals that were developed were then adopted and are being implemented.
Iceland’s child protective services contain numerous tactics in addressing supplemental housing for children. One temporary solution is “residential placement facilities”. Children are housed here for short periods, while the parents and themselves are supported by trainings and targeted sessions on improving the needs of the child. Another method taken is family homes, where children who “have not received permanent housing” are given individualized care until further placement. There are then three forms of foster care: temporary, permanent, and supported. Temporary foster care acts as a home that allows for the child to return one the improvement of the family of origin occurs. Permanent foster care takes place after their current living situation has been compromised. Then, there is a period of time where the foster parents and foster child become acquainted. Once a match has been established, there is the possibility to create long lasting bonds. Supported foster care is for children “with major emotional and behavioral problems” and lasts for “a maximum of two years”. In this level of care they are provided intensive support by professionals and their foster parents.
Prioritizing the well-being of children and youth there is an indication of the potential empowerment of the future. Escalating the status of children and the enshrinement of children’s rights within national legislation and targeted policies internationally could produce a new generation of security for children.","March 12, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/european-affairs-childrens-rights-in-iceland/,Sterling Rosen,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
Let’s Tune In To The EU’s Periphery: An Italian Ex-Minister’s Sacrifice For Love,"When people find themselves head over heels for another individual, this sometimes leads to do anything they can in order to court this individual. For Gennaro Sangiuliano, this led him to losing his job as Minister of Cultural Affairs. He is the first minister of Giorgia Meloni’s government who has resigned. While he has not been scandal-free, his demise came about due to his promise to a former girlfriend, Maria Rosaria Boccia, that he would give her a job as an advisor. While Sangiuliano was not fired, it seemed improbable that he would be able to continue as Minister of Cultural Affairs.
San Giuliano allegedly met Boccia in Naples and had a “sentimental affair” with her. When he resigned, he also apologized to his wife for the affair. There are concerns that he potentially spent funds from the government. Potential evidence is from Boccia herself who secretly recorded herself with Sangiuliano using her Ray Ban sunglasses when he was on official government trips. Sangiuliano has refuted the claims any state funds were spent on her and has allegedly provided documentation showing that he paid for her to accompany him from his own pocket. This appears to be true according to documentation provided, along withevidencethat she at least paid for a hotel room once with her own money. This directly contradicts her claim“non ho mai pagato nulla”( I never paid anything). This makes Boccia a less than credible source in the situation.
The whole situation came to a head when Boccia published onInstagramthat she was an adviser for major events, yet the entire staff of the Ministry of Culture denied this claim. The staff claimed that they never met her, yet she posted screenshots, allegedly of a group chat that included her and these staff members, making them untrustworthy narrators as well. The scandal has helped Boccia amass afollowingon Instagram, going from 28,000 followers to well over 100,000 followers.
What may make the situation more shocking is that Sangiuliano ishighly educated, receiving his degrees from some of the best universities in Italy. He received a master’s degree in law from Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, a second level master’s degree in private European law from Sapienza Università di Roma, and finally a Ph.D. in Law and Economy from Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. This serves as an important reminder that anyone is capable of making serious errors of judgement, regardless of their level of education.
Boccia’s Own Controversies
His ex-lover has also found herself in hot water as well. She is currently banned from the Italian Parliament after she was caught filming inside the building with spy glasses. She tried to explain herself by saying she simply wanted to give her social media followers a tour of the building. This ban is in place until the responsible bodies reverse the decision.
She was supposed to give an interview forCarta Bianca, a television program, yet Boccia pulled out at the last minute. She claims this is not because she is nervous to tell the truth but because she was not satisfied with the conditions for the interview. Time will tell if she can explain away the situation in order to save her reputation, but the situation is not looking good for her, given her blatant violation of parliamentary rules of not recording or taking photos inside. It will be interesting to see if she ever comes forward for another interview, or avoids this in order to avoid difficult questions from journalists about what truly happened.
She has further found herself in hot water as Sangiuliano hasdenouncedBoccia to the police. This is a result of Boccia calling Sangiuliano’s wife to say that he was having an affair with her. He alleges that she threatened him, which is illegal to do so against a politician. There is however a picture of him with ascratchon his forehead from a fight that allegedly occurred between July 16thand 17th, followed up with a message where she wrote“me hai fatto diventare una iena”(you turned me into a hyena), suggesting she did potentially physically attack him. Boccia risks up to seven years in prison for this. This has not stopped her however, even though hersmart phonehas been confiscated, Boccia has continued to publish more details on social media. Police officers also seized two other phones from her home, a desktop computer, and nine pen drives which have a combined memory space of 600 gigabytes.
In the end, while Boccia’s conduct may not be perfect, the majority of the responsibility lies on Sangiuliano, who was in a position in power in order to serve his nation as a member of the government. While it is possible that Boccia may have tried to use their brief affair as leverage to secure a position for herself, it is his fault for putting himself in such a situation.
It is important to make sure that we think with our brains when it comes to our jobs rather than our hearts- or lower. Sangiuliano has forever damaged his reputation and serves as an important example that we should be very careful about making promises to our partners that may put our jobs at risk. For Sangiuliano, pursuing this love interest not only significantly damaged his reputation yet also cost him 4,500 euros a month, after taxes were already withheld. This example shows that regardless of education, anyone is capable of making serious mistakes. The most serious aspect of this situation is that when people in power make poor choices that affect them personally, they risk damaging their entire nation as well. This case continues to develop and more details may be available about what precisely occurred between Sangiuliano and Boccia. Due to lies from the parties involved, it is difficult to still understand the situation.

(Analysis) Watch Out – The Looming Arms Race in the Arctic,"An air view of an F-16 and an F-15 American Air Force jet fighter. Source:Pxhere
Aside from the prevalent resources race narrative, the recent military build-up of great powers in the Arctic is supported by their intensifying military confrontations in other parts of the globe, and it’s raising the risk of an arms race in the region.
On July 24, 2024, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)interceptedtwo Chinese H-6K bombers and two Russian Tu-95MS bombers flying near Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). After the NORAD detection, they scrambled American F-16s, F-35s, and Canadian CF-18 fighters to intercept the Sino-Russo joint bomber formation. While the Russian bombers are common in flying over the Arctic region, it was the first time for the Chinese. The Russian Defense Ministry noted that thejoint bomber exercisesspanned the North Pacific, Bering, and Chukchi Seas with over five hours of operation.
However, this unprecedented event raised a question: what might be the security impacts of the joint Sino-Russo bomber exercises near Alaska in the Arctic? While some might interpret the event as a move by the great powers to establish the Arctic’s military presence to contest future access to the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and regional undersea resources amid climate change, the joint exercises reveal deeper security motivations.
Beijing’s security motivations for the joint exercises were unlikely related to economic incentives, such as contesting the NSR’s future access or dominating the undersea resources. Firstly, the Arctic’s extreme environment and low economic viability of the NSR are insufficient to drive Beijing to joint exercises near the Arctic Circle. Specifically, although the melting glaciers amid climate change provide a new shipment path, the weather conditions became more unpredictable, forcing vessels to sail near the shore and only be available for lighter ships. This situation alone already made a large volume of shipments difficult to materialize. More importantly, China’s exports primarily via southern ports like Shanghai and Guangdong make the traditional Suez route still shorter and more economically viable than the NSR.
Secondly, theextraction costs of undersea resources and related technical difficultiesare still enormous and would accompanygeopolitical impedimentsfrom Arctic states. In contrast,China’s leadershipin renewables and nuclear energy offers a more realistic and cheaper path to achieving energy security amid the global energy transformation and decarbonization trends. All these factors have made the potential costs outweigh Beijing’s economic gains from undersea resource extraction, making economic incentives unlikely to drive Beijing’s push for joint exercises.
Furthermore, a more plausible explanation for Beijing’s security motivations behind the joint exercises is the attractiveness of the Arctic’s special military significance. The Arctic has been the primary path for military strikes between global powers as it providesthe shortest pathbetween Eurasia and North America. This is why the United States strategically established its Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system to intercept missile threats there. Accordingly, the joint exercises near Alaska and the Arctic can be seen as Beijing’s attempt to exert military pressure on the U.S. homeland.

Chinese state media have confirmed this security motivation through statements from military spokespersons. Zhang Xiaogang, a Defense Ministry spokesperson, stressed that the U.S. must adapt to China’s military presence near its homeland, as the US posesgreater security concernsto China. Similarly, Hu Xijin, former Global Times editor-in-chief, argued thatsending aircraft closer to U.S.shores is necessary to counter American bomber and reconnaissance activities near China. A July 27reportalso rebukes U.S. claims of “unprecedented provocation,” criticizing frequent American military activities near Taiwan and the South China Sea.
In this vein, the joint exercises can seen as Beijing’s direct response to Washington’s military activities around its border, especially Taiwan, which Beijing deemedthe most sensitive riskbetween both sides. Considering losing military advantages against China in the Indo-Pacific, Washington is developing its “deterrence by denial” strategy to deter and defeat China in their potential conflict in Taiwan, to maintain its power. This strategy stresses that overwhelmingly attriting Chinese forces with numerous low-cost drones in their possible conflict in Taiwan, like turning it into ahellscape, is key to defeating China. This could involve limited strikes on China’s coastal air defense and naval assets with simultaneous diplomatic and economic measures (i.e., sanctions) from the U.S. and its allies. Accordingly, the joint bomber exercises can be seen as Beijing’s signal to Washington that its North American homeland might be struck if their conflict erupts near China’s border.
Beijing is also expected to continue bolstering its military presence in the Arctic amid its growing geopolitical confrontations with Washington in the Indo-Pacific. Given the U.S. long-held asymmetrical geopolitical advantage, by projecting military power near its adversaries through overseas bases, Beijing is strengthening its deterrence capabilities in the Arctic to eliminate this gap. Chinese international politics professor Shen Yi told CCTV, another state media outlet, that the joint exercises showed China’sdeterrence capabilitiesamid its rivalry with the U.S. and that it will continually enhance them. Cameron Carlson, former director of UAF’s Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, also noted that the joint exercises were China’s signal that it would conductmore similar exercisesin the Arctic region to project its power near the American homeland.

The Kremlin’s security motivation behind the joint exercises with China can be better understood through the unprecedented nature of these drills. Traditionally, Russia has viewed the Arctic as itsbackyardand is cautious of Chinese influences stepping into the region. However, for the first time, Russia allowed Chinese bombers to operate from its highly sensitive Anadyr Air Base, which contains its most sensitive military secrets, such as specialized ammunition and electronic warfare systems.Sergey Ishchenko, a Russian military analyst, stressed that the maximum flight radius of China’s H-6 bombers could not reach high latitudes like the Chukchi Sea without Russian airfield support. But Russia never allowed foreigners to enter Anadyr, let alone permit their military aircraft to take off. Accordingly, allowing Chinese bombers to use Anadyr for joint exercises signals a subtle shift in Moscow’s Arctic defense strategy and its military ties with China.
Sergey’s analysis provides more insights into Moscow’s reasons behind such a shift. He noted that the Director of U.S. National Intelligence, Avril Haines, mentioned that the U.S. must anticipate Russia’s role in a potential Taiwan conflict, as Moscow will unlikely be a bystander. Becca Wasser, head of the Center for New American Security, concurs and expects Russia to engage in distractive military actions elsewhere to split American resources that could focus on China. Sergey argued that regardless of future developments, Russia offered what China needed: to monitor Washington more closely than ever. In other words, Russia is strategically manipulating the Chinese military presence in the Arctic to pressure the U.S.
Such strategic calculations of Moscow could be understood by considering its military confrontations with the US amid the Ukraine war. Since the war outbreak, the U.S. has notably increased its military deployments around Russia’s doorstep for deterrence. This involvesenhancing NATO’s forward presencein Eastern Europe,redeploying American long-range missilesin Germany, and graduallypermitting Ukraine to strike the Russian homelandwith NATO weapons. However, from Moscow’s perspective, these military buildups along its borders are escalating the Western proxy war in Ukraine into adirect conflictwith the U.S.-led NATO while forcing it to prepare forprolonged confrontations.

While Russia cannot confront NATO alone, offering Anadyr for Chinese bombers for usage in their possible conflict in Taiwan could offer Moscow additional leverage in its long-term confrontations or negotiations with the U.S. Specifically, introducing Chinese military presence in the Arctic during relative peacetime could force the U.S. to allocate more resources to the struggle with China while focusing less on itself. Conversely, Moscow could secure a powerful ally if the Taiwan conflict broke out between China and the US. Even if the U.S. eventually seeks tonegotiateUkraine’s future, Russia’s neutral stance between China and the U.S. could be leveraged to extract concessions from NATO regarding its military presence around Russia’s borders.
In other words, like Beijing, Moscow’s push for joint bomber exercises is closely related to its growing military confrontations with the US elsewhere. Considering NATO mulls to allow Ukraine to use its long-range missiles toattack the core Russiawhile heightening the tensions between Moscow, Moscow’s push for growing Russo-Sino military cooperation near the Arctic is expected to continue.
Recognizing the growing Sino-Russo military presence in the Arctic and the region’s proximity to the U.S. homeland, the Mitchell Institute advised the Pentagon in October 2023 to build amulti-layered missile defeat system. This system comprises early detection, tracking, attribution, and counterstrike capabilities against aviation and missile threats from adversaries from the High North.
The U.S. thus requires a network of sensors consisting of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites and drones, like the MQ9, for early warning while employing drones and reconnaissance planes, like the P-8, for potential threat tracking. Afterward, tracking intelligence would transmit to an over-the-horizon radar for further attribution, and then early warning aircraft would track and lead fighters, like the F-35A, for counterstrikes. However, communication satellites are the first element and paramount for making the system viable by ensuring high-speed data transmission across the defense network to establish the Arctic’s information dominance. After the system’s establishment, it’s believed it would bestow Americans with pre-emptive advantages to deter the Arctic’s military deployment of adversaries.
Meanwhile, thePentagonreleased its2024 Arctic Strategyon July 22, before the Sino-Russo joint exercises occurred, largely aimed at establishing this missile defeat system. The strategy notes that the US would bolster its ISR and missile warning capabilities and data and communication infrastructure, which include operatingover 250 fighters, like the F35, with allies by 2030. The U.S. would also engage with allies to enhance domain awareness and military readiness, like increasing their forward presence. Simultaneously, the U.S. would strengthen its exercises, permanently deploy its Joint Forces units in Alaska with rotational unit support, and routinely conduct air defense and maritime drills with allies.
After the Strategy was released, the U.S. swiftly implemented it and put it into action. For instance, the U.S. launchedtwo communication satellitesused for commercial and military purposes for Norway in August. It also began theNorthern Viking 2024defense exercise in and around Iceland with its allies to secure the sea routes of the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap. Besides, it newly established the “Arctic Aviation Command” at Alaska’s Fort Wainwright base to strengthen its military readiness.
Recently, these Arctic military deployments exhibited a tit-for-tat situation between global powers. Amid the rising tensions with NATO, Russia unfolded the largest military drill, “Ocean 2024”, for 30 years with China, which spanned the Pacific and Arctic oceans betweenSeptember 10 and September 16. Simultaneously, the U.S. dispatched adestroyerandtwo HIMARS rocket launcherswith airborne troops to Alaska to warn Russia. It also held the “Operation Polar Vortex” multi-domain exercises from September 11 to September 15 to show its rapid response capabilities to defend its homeland. These concurrent and strong confrontational exercises highlight the growing military tensions between global powers.

Given the region’s geographic proximity to global powers, the Arctic is vital for their homeland security. This situation would naturally push major powers to augment their military presence in the region when their confrontations intensified for deterrence and counterbalance. As the current tensions continue heightening rather than de-escalating, both sides will likely continue to increase their regional military presence to ensure the balance of power can tilt toward its side, and the Sino-Russo joint bomber exercises were only a beginning. Eventually, this build-up could spark more frequent and larger-scale offense-and-defense confrontational exercises, increasing the risk of a regional arms race. As a Finnish security expert, Minna Alander, notes that the Arctic will no longer be free from world power struggle but might become ‘high north, high tension.’

Galípolo’s appointment and the political stakes of Central Bank autonomy in Brazil,"With 66 votes in favor, five against, and no abstentions, the full Senate approved the nomination of economist Gabriel Galípolo as president of the Central Bank (BC). Amid growing debates about Brazil’s economic policy,Galípolo was nominated by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) to take over the presidency of the Central Bankin place of Roberto Campos Neto, whose term will end on December 31st of this year. Despite being critical of the Central Bank’s current interest rate policy and its current president, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has indicated that he does not intend to make any demands of Gabriel Galípolo when he takes over as president of the Bank. Galípolo also stated in an interview that hewas guaranteed “freedom in decision-making”and was committed to the interests of the Brazilian population. Lula’s tacit support of the Central Bank’s autonomy raises questions about why Lula is adopting a more open and moderate stance regarding the institution.
In Brazil, as in other countries, the Central Bank is responsible for defining the country’s monetary policy. Its mission is to control inflation, primarily using tools such as the basic interest rate (Selic). However, high interest rates have a direct impact on the lives of Brazilians, raising the cost of financing and making credit more expensive, which affects everything from purchasing homes to small business loans. On the other hand, a forced reduction in the basic interest rate can lead to uncertainty and capital flight, which causes the currency to depreciate and prices to rise.
This crucial role of interest rates in shaping daily life makes the Central Bank’s policies a constant subject of debate. Amidst these discussions, a significant turning point came in 2021, when the institution gained operational autonomy through a law sanctioned by then-president Jair Bolsonaro. The law, which passed witha large majority support in the National Congress, marked a milestone in Brazilian monetary policy. Byestablishing fixed terms for the president and directors of the Central Bank that do not coincide with the term of the President of the Republic, the institution gained greater independence from political influence, particularly in decisions like setting interest rates.
This autonomy allows the Central Bank to make crucial decisions for the country’s economy, such as controlling interest rates, without the need for direct approval from the president. However, this very independence has generated controversy, especially in the context of high inflation and high interest rates, issues that directly affect the population and the government. Galípolo, as the new president, faces the challenge of balancing these pressures while maintaining confidence in the Central Bank, a task made all the more delicate by Lula’s historic stance on the institution’s autonomy.
The approval of the law is not an innovation, even within Brazil. Previously, the Central Bank was the only regulatory body without a fixed term for its leadership, making it more vulnerable to political interference. Furthermore, Brazil has merely followed the path of the world’s major economies. Other major central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB), follow the same line of autonomy. The terms of office of the chair of the Federal Reserve are 4 years, not coinciding with the term of the chief executive, and must be approved by the Senate. Similarly, the European Central Bank (ECB) has non-renewable terms of 8 years, which Parliament must approve.
What has Lula said about it?
As mentioned, the Central Bank gained operational autonomy in 2021, during Jair Bolsonaro’s administration, and Lula resumed the presidency in 2023. Since then, the independence has been a source of tension between the Central Bank and the Executive. Lula has been critical of the Central Bank’s independence and its management of interest rates.In Lula’s view, the rates were too high, limiting the government’s ability to invest in critical projects, which, he argued, harmed the Brazilian people. At one point, Lula even suggested that Roberto Campos Neto, the current president of the Central Bank,was pursuing a political agenda aimed at damaging the country.
Beyond criticizing interest rate policies, Lula went further by directly questioning why he couldn’t appoint a new president for the bank upon taking office.“How can a president who was not elected by the current government continue to head the Central Bank?”he asked, implying that the selection of a new Central Bank president should fall under the authority of the elected government. This criticism targets the heart of the Central Bank Autonomy Law, which was designed specifically to prevent political interference in monetary decision-making. At another time, Lula also pointed out:“The president never interferes with Copom’s decisions… Meirelles had autonomy with me, but I had the power to remove him, just as FHC removed others. Then they decided it was important for the Central Bank to be independent and autonomous. But autonomous for whom?”
It’s also worth mentioning that Lula’s criticism has resonated with the public. AQuaest/Genialpoll conducted in July 2024 revealed that 66% of Brazilians agree with the president’s critiques of the Central Bank’s interest rate policies. Only 23% disagreed, while 11% remained neutral or did not respond. Lula is right about one thing: the rates are indeed high. Brazil currently holds the second-highest real interest rate in the world at 7.33%, according to economistJason Vieira from MoneYou.However, experts note that the rates are justified, considering the persistent inflationary pressures, fiscal challenges, and a volatile global economy. For the Central Bank, such measures are crucial for controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability in the context of global uncertainty and domestic fiscal concerns.
Galípolo isan economist with vast experience in both the public and private sectors, who has risen to prominence as the executive secretary of the Ministry of Finance. His recent vote to raise interest rates as part of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) highlights his commitment to addressing inflation concerns,a move that the Lula administration defended in the face of potential criticism.Galípolo has also signaled his supportfor a Constitutional Amendment Bill that would further guarantee the Central Bank’s financial autonomy, though this proposal has encountered some delays due to ongoing disagreements between Lula and current Central Bank president Roberto Campos Neto. Galípolo’s technical expertise and experience, combined with this new political strategy, mark his appointment as a pivotal moment in Lula’s government.
As stipulated by the Central Bank’s Autonomy Law, Galípolo’s nomination had to be approved by the Senate. With 13 different parties represented in the Senate, including the Liberal Party (PL) -of former president Bolsonaro and persistent opposition to Lula – Lula had to secure support beyond his Workers’ Party (PT), which holds only 11% of the seats. To win approval, Lula needed to build alliances with centrist and right-leaning parties. Galípolo’s moderate and technocratic profile proved acceptable to a broad range of political ideologies, helping him win support even from figures aligned with the opposition.
This political dynamic reflects Brazil’s system of“coalition presidentialism”, as described by political scientist Sérgio Abranches. Under this system, the executive branch must navigate a highly fragmented Congress, building coalitions across the political spectrum to pass legislation and implement policy. This system often prevents radical shifts in policy, instead encouraging negotiation and compromise. Therefore, Brazil’s party diversity, often criticized for splintering political power, plays a crucial role in maintaining checks and balances. It ensures that no single branch of government can dominate, forcing the executive to collaborate with different factions in Congress.
In this way, Galípolo’s appointment, achieved through consensus-building efforts involving centrist and opposition parties, was approved with 66 votes in favor, five against, and no abstentions. This illustrates how consensus-building can act as a stabilizing force. As the new president of the Central Bank, Galípolo will play a key role in shaping Brazil’s economic future by balancing monetary policy decisions. While Congress is expected to continue to act as a balancer of forces in Brazil, political equilibrium in Brazil remains crucial to safeguarding both democratic institutions and economic stability.

Brazil’s historic G-20 tax proposal could mark a turning point for the global taxation scenario,"In July 2024, anew global tax proposalby Brazil’s Finance Minister, Fernando Haddad, in the context of the G-20, broke ground and gathered worldwide attention and scrutiny. Following Brazil’s temporary leadership position in the G-20, composed of the world’s 19 largest economies and the European Union, the proposal, sponsored by Mr Haddad and ultimately approved by all other members, calls for increased cooperation regarding taxation on the global super-rich. Documents and studies commissioned by the Brazilian presidency and based on EU Tax Observatory Coordinator Gabriel Zucman’s work include a proposed 2% global tax on billionaires. If implemented, such a measure could reportedly gather up to 250 billion USD globally. Furthermore, extending the tax requirements for “multimillionaires” could reportedly net an additional 100 billion USD.
The text, put forward in July 2024 in a ministerial congregation involving the G-20’s Finance Ministers and Central Bank Chairmen, has been approved as a joint ministerial declaration. However, it still needs to be ratified this November, at the G-20 summit, which will happen in Rio de Janeiro. The proposal has been widely describedas progressive and bold, and its potential approval by the G-20 Heads of State this year could signal a marked turnover in the global tax atmosphere. Mr Haddad’s team has reportedly also based their suggestions on Nobel Prize-winner French economist Esther Duflo, alongside Gabriel Zucman. The expected gains arising from such increased taxation have been noted by Mr Haddad’s team to be of potential use in combatting worldwide issues, such as the climate emergency, energy transition, world hunger, inequality, and other pressing social issues.
Coming from the neoliberal turn of the 1970s and 1980s, the worldwide taxation scenario has been continuously relaxed and liberalized. Following the end of the regulated Bretton Woods system, the termination of the global gold standard, and the widespread relaxation of capital movements, the West, and the world at large have seen an increasingly liberalized tax scenario. The advent oftrickle-down economicsand the worldwide promotion of neoliberalism andsupply-sidemeasures have largely spared corporate and capital taxation while preferring to focus on income and sales taxation, which necessarily penalizes the middle class and working populations more. According toGabriel Zucman’s recent studies, the effective tax rate on the billionaire class stands at around 0.3%.
In this sense, it’s no surprise that Brazil figures as the originator of the proposal. Mr Haddad’s home country is in a way very representative of these challenges and tax inefficiencies. Struggling to balance his tenure as a Finance Minister of a left-wing party in Brazil with fiscal requirements claimed by markets and institutions, Mr. Haddad’s G-20 global suggestionsare very much linked to his domestic issues. Fighting for increased taxation domestically has been one of Mr. Haddad’s main political struggles at home, while his sponsored G-20 suggestion represents  another front on the same issue, this time internationally. In late 2023,Haddad’s Ministry had already moved on this issue in Brazil, proposing new regulations and taxation on family-owned, ultra-high-net-worth exclusive investment funds.
However, many technical difficulties have been noted in response to the proposal, andcriticsare quick to raise points on the operational and technical side, not to mention political and theoretical disagreements. While the main theoretical and ideological proponents linked to low taxation have been slowly ceding ground to more progressive solutions in the face of enormous global challenges— such as the climate emergency or social issues— practical and logistical arguments persist. These objections appear to be the primary rationale used to counter broad and ambitious global tax proposals.
At the same time,the discussion of a global tax reformulationin this context is in and of itself very much a response to previous technical limitations. In the absence of global coordination, country-specific tax raises can often result in capital flight, especially in our current context of increased international money mobility and the lack of capital movement regulation. Thus, bringing this discussion to an international forum with explicit agreement from high-profile stakeholders can be seen as an effort to unify disparate country-specific policies. It aims to establish a strong technical and operational background from which more progressive taxation can arise.
Nevertheless, getting explicit approval from a wide set of high-profile stakeholders can be as challenging or even more so than engaging in country-specific tax policies. International forums are notoriously filled with high-spirited proposals that frequently struggle to see the light of day. Even if innovative and bold proposals can be agreed upon on a clear and widely-observed international stage, they can typically be dehydrated and stripped of their more prepositive ideas by their national application, which frequently is heavily marked by entrenched domestic interests. Mr Haddad himself has reportedly noted that themes of such nature can advance very slowly on an international sphere, but that there was nothing stopping countries from acting even more boldly in their domestic arenas.
Toward the year’s end, G-20’s Chiefs of State will be inevitably brought against this resolution, which has already been signed off by their respective Finance Ministers and Central Bank Chairmen in the July meeting.US Secretary of Treasury Janet YellenandGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindnerboth have reportedly expressed reservations against the proposal, with Yellen allegedly claiming it was better to leave tax discussions to country-specific policies, while Lindner reportedly claiming the proposal to be not relevant. Pressured by their constituency, these stakeholders might well back off from the more aggressive proposals, preferring local discussions and measures; or they might make history with a strong progressive taxation message.
Lastly, originating from the Brazilian staff, this proposal also highlightsPresident Lula’s international footprint, which has been widely noted as one of his strong suits in Brazil’s top executive position.Past TNGOarticles have already dealt with Lula’s international ambition. Rivalling his predecessor Bolsonaro’s often lacklustre international profile, Lula’s Itamaraty strives for high-profile actions and high-impact propositions, and aims to position Brazil as a leader of the so-called Global South. Therefore, Brazil’s bold G20 tax proposal serves as a high-powered and forward-looking message on many levels.

The story behind the 2024 Labour victory and lessons for other left-leaning parties across continental Europe,"The collapse of the Conservative party after more than a decade of uninterrupted rule didn’t come as a surprise to anyone, but the reasons for a record voter turnout in favor of Labour are more complex than it seems at first glance. Keir Starmer has secured an astonishing victory and the largest majority government in 25 years with 412 seats in the House of Commons (Kirk et al., 8024). The landslide majority has almost overshadowed a fact that could unravel the Labour success story.
Despite securing 211 seats more than in the last general election, is it important to note that Starmer has underperformed in terms of vote share compared to past leaders of the party, which suggests that victory margins were narrower this time around (Bhatiya, 2024). This would suggest that the prevalent media narrative of a liberal comeback may be deceiving and that British voters did not choose a left majority but rather decided to vote out the ineffective Tory government. Ben Wellings, a professor at Monash University, has questioned whether the recent UK election represents a real change in voter preference, or if it is just one more instance of electoral volatility (2024). This article analyzes to what extent the Labour Party can claim credit for their election success, and if there are lessons to be learned for their European colleagues.
Labour Manifesto
Underneath a studious-looking photo of its current leader, Keir Starmer, the title page ofLabour’s Party Manifestoreads, ”Our plan for Britain is a fully costed, fully funded, credible plan to turn the country around after 14 years of the Conservatives. It contains a tax lock for working people – a pledge not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT.”It continues, “Public investment, where it supports and de-risks additional private investment, is one important tool being used successfully across the world,”  and “Labour will cap corporation tax at the current level of 25 percent, the lowest in the G7, for the entire parliament, and we will act if tax changes in other countries pose a risk to UK competitiveness.”
One of the keypromisesis not to raise the main rates of VAT, National Insurance, Income, or Corporation tax, which comes off as rather unusual for a left-wing party. Indeed, a general trend of aligning Labour towards the centre has been observed by experts and watchers. AsClaire Ainsleystates, “Elections are fought and won in the centre ground of British politics. The challenge for Labour now, and the centre-left around the world, is to revive the centre as a dynamic political force that inspires hope as well as security.” She argues that the centre-left should aim at creating the conditions for innovation and prosperity, while also responding to the needs of the people.
Responding to voter needs
The decade following the Financial Crisis has seen voters more concerned about matters such as mortgage payments, rent, bills, and necessities. Incidentally, it was also marked by a global rise of the political right that seemed unstoppable. Although it looks as if social democracy could be back with the election of social democrats in Germany, the far-right still looms at large, and leftwing parties are anxiously searching for a strategy on how to win back voters’ trust. According to some observers, Labour has taken desperate measures and has deliberatelypurgedthe left within its ranks, most notably Jeremy Corby, the former Party leader who was thought to support more “extreme” left policies. Keir Starmer hasclaimedas early as 2022 that Labour is firmly in the center ground of British politics, from where he believes his party is ready to answer voter demands.
Hisstrategyof combating the radical right differs from that of his colleagues in that he has chosen a less ideological route, consisting of removing potholes in the nation’s roads and tackling hospital waiting times, all in the hopes of addressing what is believed to be the root cause of far-right popularity: dissatisfaction with the living standards. His goal is to deal with socio-economic conditions that have created the space for extremist violence, and show Brits that “politics can solve real-world problems.”
Labour victory in perspective
Despite securing a landslide majority, criticsarguethat having only won 34% of the overall vote, Labour does not have a strong mandate to govern. The 2024 election was not only marked by a historically low voter turnout, at only 60%, but also by a rise in support for alternative parties such as Liberal Democrats, and the right-wing populist Reform UK, which ranked third when it comes to overall vote share. Apurav Bhatiya argues that, while the 2024 election was a record defeat for the Conservatives, the Labour victory can be attributed to “voters’ dissatisfaction with the Conservative government’s handling of the cost of living crisis and internal party conflicts, suggesting that the result was more an anti-Conservative vote than a pro-Labour one.”
Martin Williamsexplains that the support for Labour did not increase and that the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system is to thank for the Party’s success, whileJohn Curtice, a BBC polling expert, agrees that Labour victory has been achieved on the back of a stark 20 point decline in Conservative support, stating that “All in all this looks more like an election the Conservatives lost than one Labour won.” ChrisMasonputs it clearly: “The story of this election is one of an electorate showing a ruthless determination to eject the Conservatives. In plenty of places that meant electing a Labour MP.”
Conclusion
There is no doubt that Labour policies will dominate Britain’s economy and society for the next four years, but what was once a markedly left-leaning party is now one exhibiting more centrist reforms that hope to appeal to a wider electorate. Experts that shown, however, that a landslide Labour victory is masked by a dissatisfaction with the current status quo that has resulted in a massive drop in Conservative support, and a determination to vote them out. By responding to voters’ long-standing socio-economic problems, Starmer hopes to consolidate his Party’s newly won power and at the same time weaken the far-right.
Questions for consideration:
What can other left parties learn from the 2024 UK elections?
Has Labour chosen the correct strategy for combating the far-right?
Will Keir Starmer be an effective Labour leader?

Brazil’s Supreme Court: Democracy in Crisis?,"Judicialisation—the transfer of power from other political bodies to the judiciary—has been a growing trend within Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court (STF). The 1988 Constituent Assembly marked a significant expansion of fundamental rightsenshrined by the Constitution. Insofar as these rights are essentially principles—freedom of expression, right to life, etc.—, it is the Court’s prerogative to interpret what their observance consists of. Although judicial bodies are responsible for enforcing legislation rather than passing new laws, the open-endedness of rights in the new charter gave the STF authority over many matters typically within the purview of the legislative and executive branches.
For instance, the Supreme Court holds the prerogative to overrule the parliamentary majority to protect minority rights. Should it decide that Congress, by not addressing a given issue, has enabled a gap in the protection of fundamental rights, it can also legislate as a fill-in. Judicial activism—when the court interprets and applies the law more broadly to fill legislative gaps—is grounded in the Constitution as an exceptional mechanism. It remained relatively well-integrated into democracy throughout most of the recent decades, with other branches of government often viewing it as a means to outsource unpopular policies.
Being a post-war event, the Brazilian Constitution arose when democracies generally transitioned from the individual-centered Liberal State to themore collective profile of the Welfare State. As constitutions worldwide leaned towards the expansion of rights, democracies saw judicial bodies become, as a rule, more assertive in interpreting and enforcing constitutional norms and principles.
This prerogative has since been raised in many relevant judgments by the STF. When voting in favor of allowing the termination of pregnancies with anencephalic fetuses, JusticeCármen Lúciadefined the procedure as countering ‘unnecessary and disproportionate suffering on women […] in light ofthe constitutional principles which protect human beings‘. In the suit that declared corporate donations to electoral campaigns unconstitutional, JusticeLuiz Fuxargued that such donations ‘offend republican and democratic principles, since [they skew] political representation and jeopardises the legitimacy of elections’. Being policy-related, kindred rulings typically created little public upheaval. Since 2010, however, personalised corruption trials like ‘Mensalão’ and ‘Lava Jato’ have pushed judicial bodies—STF included—to unprecedented public scrutiny.
The presidency of Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022) represented a turning point in the three-power balance. Brazil was undergoing acute polarisation, manifested through a divisive ratio of Petistas—Workers’ Party (PT) supporters—and Anti-Petistas led by Bolsonaro. Before running for President, Bolsonaro made a name in Congress as a staunch supporter of the Brazilian military dictatorship (1964–1985). His vote in favor of the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016), broadcasted live on open television, began with the assertion that ‘they [who] lost in 1964, […] lost now in 2016’, and concluded paying homage to Carlos Ustra, a dictatorship-era colonel who allegedly tortured young Rousseff. During his speech, Bolsonaro referred to Ustra as ‘Dilma’s dread’.
As members of an institution whose modern prerogatives were laid during re-democratisation, many in the Supreme Court saw Bolsonaro’s campaign with concern—a feeling reiterated when the candidate announced heplanned on court-packing the STF. Tension grew substantially once Bolsonaro was elected. Alongside restricting federal-level executive authority in policies related to COVID-19, the Courtinitiated an inquiryinvestigating several of Bolsonaro’s allies accused of spreading disinformation on democratic institutions. The inquiry later expanded to include both alleged funding networks behind disinformation and threats made against STF Justices. As the one assigned to preside over the inquiry, Justice Alexandre de Moraes experienced the early stages of his surge in notoriety, which has not slackened since.
Attrition between President Jair Bolsonaro and the STF peaked in the periodfrom July to September 2021. Throughout July, the President made increasingly bolder statements against Brazil’s electoral system, often challenging the legitimacy of electronic ballots and claiming the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) was complicit with fraud. The TSE reacted by sending a criminal notice to STF Justice Moraes accusing President Bolsonaro of disinformation and undemocratic discourse. Moraes accepted the request, to which Bolsonaro then threatened to bypass the Constitution. ‘My game is played within the pitch,’ the President told the press. ‘But if it leaves the pitch, I’m compelled to leave the pitch too.’
As animosity escalated, STF President Justice Luiz Fux deleted a planned conciliation meeting between the three branches of government, saying he had previously cautioned President Bolsonaro about the limits of the right to freedom of expression and the ‘non-negotiable respect between the branches of government’. On Bolsonaro’s ‘repeated offences’ to Justices Barroso and Moraes, Justice Fux stated that ‘when you attack one member of the Court, you attack the entire Court’.
On September 7th, President Bolsonaro visited two parades honouring Brazil’s Independence Day—one in Brasília, one in São Paulo. His statements that day werethe most explicit so faragainst the STF and democracy overall. The President labelled the demonstrations an ‘ultimatum’ to Brazilian institutions, asserting that he would only leave the presidency ‘dead, imprisoned, or victorious’. His speeches antagonised the STF mostly concerning Justice Moraes, henceforth consolidated to Bolsonaristasas their main adversary.
This two-month period marked a turning point for the STFvis-à-visother branches of government—not only because it revealed vulnerabilities in a still recent democracy, but also because it provided a depiction of how the ‘political chessboard’ surrounding the Supreme Court has looked ever since. Brazilian democracy has quaked many more times. A Capitol-inspiredstorming of the Three Powers Plazaby Bolsonaro supporters widened the range of sentiments over the STF. Under Moraes, the Court has sentenced over 200 people involved in the event, withrulings of up to 17 years in prison. Also under Moraes, the TSEdeclared Bolsonaro ineligible until 2030for spreading disinformation on the Brazilian electoral system, whilst investigations into the ‘digital militias’ continue the Justice’s protagonism within the Supreme Court.
Notwithstanding the eventful character of the decade, the chessboard has somewhat remained the same all the way through, at least concerning the stakeholders on each side. Bolsonaro may be politically weakened, but Bolsonarismoremains influential in Congress. A Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI) was recently filed with the Chamber of Deputies to investigate alleged abuse of authority by Moraes, with 147 federal deputiesdeclaring their supportfor opening impeachment proceedings against the Justice, 273 undecided and 96 against. Members of the Senate—the body responsible for processing and judging impeachment requests for STF Justices—have announced thatthey should delay filing for impeachmentuntil September to galvanise public support and gather evidence.
Most STF Justices have consolidated around Moraes to present an optics of internal stability. When deciding on issues related to disinformation and democratic principles, they have mostly conveyed coherence over variance. Consequently, the Court has increasingly relied upon Moraes’ hard-line approach in kindred issues. Despite Bolsonaro supporters seeing Justice Moraes as a ‘dictator‘, the current presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva praises him as a strongmaninstrumental in safeguarding democracy. Division was blatant in2024’s Independence Day—the government-backed parade in Brasília was titled ‘Democracy and Independence: Brazil on the right track’ and was attended by Lula and his officials alongside STF Justices, including Moraes; the parade in São Paulo, on the other hand, was attended by Bolsonaro and opposition members, marked by flags against Moraes and Lula, calls for amnesty for those arrested for the storming of the Three Powers Plaza, and pleas for the Senate to address the request for Moraes’ impeachment.
The struggle between Bolsonaristas and the STF is, on the surface, one between different notions of governance. But in the context of judicialisation, the outcome may just as well be shaped by Machiavellian politics.
To those sympathetic to Justice Moraes and the STF, Brazilian democracy faces an immediate threat that calls for a stringent response. Compared with their adversaries, they are often more lax towards the prerogative of judicial activism, viewing it as a legitimate means to counter disinformation campaigns and authoritarianism. Moraes’ decision-making, according to some, reiterates the Court’s mandate to interpret and enforce constitutional norms, including the integrity of democratic processes, where other branches may fail. Some supporters acknowledge that the Court has acted beyond its prerogatives, but argue that a context of democratic erosion calls for pragmatic rather than ideal solutions.
Conversely, critics view the STF as the real authoritarian party in this dispute, blowing activism out of proportion and thus skewing the three-power balance. A common claim is that Moraes has amassed too much power since taking charge of the TSE. Hisestablishment of a covert intelligence unitthat operates outside of Brazil’s official federal agencies is seen as threatening individual rights and proper oversight. Moreover, critics argue that several of the emergency measures implemented under his leadership—such asimposing fines on VPN users,jailing individuals without a trial for social media posts, andsuspending social media accounts or entire platforms(e.g., Telegram and Elon Musk’s X)—, may persist beyond the current political circumstances. There is concern that these powers could be turned against political factions of varying ideologies in the future, undermining democracy as a whole.
Those critics often frame their resistance to the Supreme Court as a defence against an overly politicised judiciary. They claim that on the grounds of protecting democracy, the STF works against it through excessive punishments and biased decision-making. The struggle is described as one between elected officials and an unelected, increasingly authoritarian Court.
Judicialisation has blurred the lines of governance. Constitutions are not monolithic; as written by Lacey, ‘legal principles must be understood as contingent upon human perception and the realities of social life’. As the STF finds itself immersed in the political milieu, the dispute may be ultimately settled less by law than power.","March 05, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/brazils-supreme-court-democracy-in-crisis/,Fabiano G.

What’s going on in Argentine Intelligence?,"The role of the Argentine Intelligence System holds significant importance. Firstly, Argentina is located in a region (Southern Cone) which has been characterized by the absence of major interstate conflicts but the country faces serious issues related to drug trafficking, extremist groups, porous borders, and organized crime — among others. Additionally, recent history shows that Argentina is not immune to the phenomenon of terrorism. During the 1990s, the country sufferedtwo attacks: on March 17, 1992 against the Israeli Embassy and on July 18, 1994 against the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA).
The head of the Argentine Intelligence System, the SIDE (by its initials in Spanish forSecretaría de Inteligencia de Estado), previously named AFI (Agencia Federal de Inteligencia) between 2015 and 2024,has been the target of various criticisms: being associated with human rights violations during the Military Dictatorships of the last century, participation in internal political espionage, being connected to the two mentioned terrorist attacks and even being tied to the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman.
The structure of Argentine intelligence, along with the laws that shape National Security (Internal Security Law 24.059 of 1992) and Defense (National Defense Law 23.554 of 1988), is framed within a particular context. The decision to separate Internal Security from state type external threats was made throughout the 1980s and 1990s, after the dictatorship “Proceso de Reorganización Nacional” (1976-1983), when Argentina’s political leadership decided to limit military influence to areas specifically related to armed conflicts and external threats. The objective was to diminish the power of the military, who throughout the past century has been interfering in Argentina’s democratic life with coups d’état.
In 2001, the National Intelligence Law 25.520 was added to the mentioned body of laws. This regulation is the main framework for the National Intelligence System (SIN). Until then, intelligence in Argentina was still influenced by the National Security Doctrine of the 1960s, whose primary focus was combating communism and subversion, and also associated with serious human rights violations.
In this sense, the spirit of separating  internal security from the defense against external threats also influenced Law 25.520. This law established an Intelligence System with components that follow the same logic of dividing internal from external intelligence: SIDE (renamed as AFI after the 2015 reform; renamed to SIDE again from 2024) as the leading entity within the structure, National Directorate of Strategic Military Intelligence ( in Spanish:DINIEM) under the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for the production of strategic military intelligence related to external threats from state actors or war-related threats and National Directorate of Criminal Intelligence (in Spanish:DINICRI) under the Ministry of Security, responsible for producing criminal intelligence.
Law 25.520provides the definitions of activities under jurisdiction of the Argentine National Intelligence System, as well as the limits to intelligence activities. It establishes protocols for the collection and storage of information, declassification timelines, and affirms that communications are inviolable, except when they are authorized by a judge.
Beyond the idea of separationof the military forces from the internal political life of the country, the goal of this law was bringing transparency to intelligence activities. The most significant change introduced was the creation of a Bicameral Commission (composed of members from both legislative chambers) to control and audit reserved expenses. The issue of reserved expenses is particularly important, as they were never subject to review before the induction of this law. From this point on, secret regulations in intelligence matters in Argentina were eliminated, and the country became the first in Latin America to establish a specific legislative body to control and regulate intelligence activities.
Law 25.520 aimed to bring transparency to the system. However, the 2000s were not free from scandals for Argentine intelligence. The critical point came in 2015 during a period of institutional crisis and general questioning of the intelligence services following the death of Prosecutor Alberto Nisman who was in charge of investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing. His death remains a subject of controversy; he died just hours before he was set to filean accusation against then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchnerfor allegedly covering up the AMIA bombing and making a pact with Iran.
In this context, a reform process took place, leading to the enactment of the reforming Law 27.126. The main change involved an image makeover, with the SIDE being rebranded as the AFI. However, the most significant change concerned phone surveillance and wiretapping. Until 2015, the Directorate of Judicial Surveillance (known in Spanish asDOJand colloquially asOJOTA) was responsible for intercepting communications and was part of the SIDE. Although judicial authorization was required, the transfer of this Directorate to the judiciary (Public Prosecutor’s Office) meant that the newly formed AFI no longer had the ability to conduct wiretaps.
Starting in 2015, a trend emerged in which the AFI gradually distanced from functions related to the judiciary. The main change was mentioned transfer of the “OJOTA.” The final blow came during the government of Alberto Fernández, who, through a Decree, prohibited intelligence agencies from acting as auxiliaries to the judiciary in judicial investigations. Since 2020, Argentine intelligence only produces information relevant to national security, directed solely to the president.
With Javier Milei’s arrival in December 2023, things did not change much at “La Casa” (as the SIDE is often referred to colloquially). Milei came to power with libertarian ideals, such as minimal state intervention in the economy and reducing the deficit and public sector spending. AsRawlings Mitema Onserio points out“The candidate has also endorsed the individual right to freely sell organs, in addition to rampant privatization of state companies, pension cuts, and charging for public hospital services.” The government’s approach to intelligence was no different from its agenda for other areas: staff cuts, especially targeting those agents hired during previous presidential administrations. The difference was in the budgetary aspect, where the AFI was among the least affected by the“plan motosierra”(Milei’s economic plan, which refers to cutting public spending with a chainsaw)
On the other hand, Argentina’s intelligence agenda aligned with the positive shift in the country’s foreign relations towards the United States. This shift in agenda materialized in February 2024, when Nicolas Posse (Chief of Cabinet) and Silvestre Sívori (Director of SIDE)traveled to Washingtonto meet with William Burns, the director of the CIA, and officials from SOUTHCOM.
The new SIDE director, Sívori, was aligned with the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Posse. Six months after taking office, Posse was removed. With the  fall of Posse, Sívori also resigned. The context of their departure was shaped by events familiar to the history of the SIDE: internal political espionage on Cabinet members close to Milei. In response to this situation, Milei chose to delegate the appointment of the SIDE director to Santiago Caputo. Caputo’s voice has become one of the President’s main influences, and he has become one of the most trusted and strategic figures within the current government. With his strong strategic abilities, Caputo earned the status of “star advisor” and the “brain” behind Milei’s presidential campaign.
But that was not all, in mid-July of this year, through Decree 614/2024, the government announced the dissolution of the AFI, which was replaced by the new SIDE (yes! with the same historic name it had before 2015). The decision to delegate SIDE related matters to Caputo was intended to create the impression that intelligence once again reported directly to the President rather than to the Chief of Cabinet (as had been the case during the short-lived Sívori-Posse period). The leadership of the AFI was entrusted to a close associate of Caputo: Sergio Neiffert.
The SIDE’s leadership was established along with four sub-agencies. The first is the SIA (Servicio de Inteligencia Argentino), responsible for external intelligence. Then, there is the ASN (Agencia de Seguridad Nacional), aimed at gathering information on complex federal crimes. The third is the AFC (Agencia Federal de Ciberseguridad), tasked with planning solutions and responding to cyberattacks. There was also the addition of an Internal Affairs Division that supervises and audits the other three sub-agencies.
In addition to the recent historical context in which Argentina suffered two attacks in the 1990s, there are a series of factors that could make Argentina a potential target for fundamentalist terrorism.
Milei’s foreign policy is characterized by a highly direct and personal approach to international relations. Milei’s geopolitical shift towards closer ties with Israel deviates from Argentina’s historical position of balanced diplomacy in the Middle East. In this context, statements such as his desire to move the Argentine embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, choosing Israel as the destination for his first official visit, and designating Hamas as a terrorist group, among others, could make Iran or proxy groups potential enemies of the Argentine state. In fact, Teheran Times, a media outlet close to Iranian authorities, warnedArgentina that it would “regret their enmity with Iran”
Argentina’s geographic characteristics make it a place with “porous” borders. The Triple Border area between Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina has historically been identified as an operational hub for various transnational organized crime groups and is still considered a potential site for the transit, establishment, and financing of terrorist groups. Additionally, a new factor could impact Argentina’s security:Bolivia and Iran have strengthened their ties in technology, security, defense, and intelligence.This has raised concerns not only because of the proximity between Argentina and Bolivia but also due to the porous border between the two countries. In this regard, the Minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich, expressed concern about the presence of Iranians with Mercosur passports who are allegedly linked to the Quds Forces (special unit of the Iranian IRGC)

Resource Dependency: Exploring the Chinese Monopoly of Critical Minerals,"Geopolitical and economic attention regarding the US-Chinese trade war has tended to fixate on control of semiconductors, energy sources, and lately, electric vehicles. The control and supply of critical minerals essential to the manufacturing of these products, and many others, has remained overlooked by comparison. China, through early and aggressive investment, has gradually developed a near monopoly over a large contingent of these critical resources, posing a serious threat to governments that are reliant on their imports for economic prosperity.
In the last decade, governments increasingly concerned by the vulnerability of mineral supply chains have established critical mineral strategies with lists that designate resources that are crucial for their industrial base. An official US government definition, formulated in theUS Energy Act of 2020, recognised non-fuel minerals that are indispensable to economic and national security, absence of which would disrupt and jeopardise key manufacturing sectors.
In 2022, this definition was used to classify50 such minerals as critical, to be reviewed every three years. The common use of these resources in a wide array of modern technology, from everyday items such as smart phones, to clean energy solutions, solar panals and wind turbines, and even vital defence systems, is what forms their central importance to economic prosperity.
Since the onset of the Ukrainian war, dependence of some European nations on Russian energy has presented a thorn in the side of any collective response by Europe. This should visualise the importance of diverse supply lines in any resources that underpin an economy. Critical minerals are, by definition, a resource that underpin economic function.
As governments pursue clean energy solutions, demand for the critical minerals necessary to produce such technology is expected to increase. Whereas the last 50 years of energy security competition has been dominated by oil and gas,the next 50 yearsis predicted to be dominated by critical minerals and supply chains.
China has emerged with a monopoly over the supply of many of these resources. According to a US subcommittee, China now enjoys a “strangle hold on global critical mineral supply chains” and has created a fragile dependence on Chinese benevolence to maintain steady supply lines. It also provides Beijing the opportunity to wield critical minerals as bargaining chips, garnering geopolitical influence – an accusation that the Chinese government already faces.
TheUS Geological Surveyestimated that in 2022, China was the world’s leading producer of 30 out of the 50 designated minerals critical to US economic and national security. Beijing has slowly acquired this control through monopolies and monopsonies over vertical supply chains of different minerals. For example, the extraction and processing of rare earth elements (17 elements which are all designated as critical minerals) is heavily dominated by China.
As of now,60 percent of world rare earthsare produced and 90 percent processed by China, providing a near complete monopoly. In other cases, where there is greater competition of resource extraction, influence is exerted through a monopsony which allows them to manipulate the market. Despiteholding less than sevenpercent of the world’s known lithium reserves, an essential component in battery production, China has strategically positioned itself as a dominant player in the global lithium trade.
Through investments and supply agreements, Chinese companies have secured vast quantities of raw lithium from nations that are rich in the resource, Australia, Chile, and Argentina. The overwhelming quantities that are supplied grants China an extensive purchasing power, enabling significant influence over the price and supply.
Further domination of the processing of lithium into battery-grade material allows control of both the upstream sourcing and downstream refinement of the resource. As nations increasingly seek the energy transitioning technologies that lithium is often critical for producing, Beijing can leverage their control to assist in their broader geopolitical agendas.
China has increased their grip on supply chains and thus the dependence of other nations. Control over critical minerals has provided Beijing a whip hand with which to pressure governments in other political situations. Between 2009 and 2020, Chinese exports ofcritical minerals were restricted nine times, more so than any other supplier in the world.
More recently, gallium and germanium exports were restricted in August 2023. This was followed by high-grade graphite in December of the same year. The two former minerals are vital components for the production of semiconductor chips and military systems. Both their markets are dominated by China, who produce80 percent of gallium and 60 percent of germanium. The regulation of these exports was cited as being for national security due to their dual use within military applications. It is more widely understood as having been retaliation to greater US, Japan, and EU prohibitions of semiconductor exports to China.
As the trade war between Washington and Beijing develops, the ability to withhold resources vital for US economic and national security presents a serious vulnerability that Beijing has proven it is willing to act upon. The commonly drawn case study is from a 2010 spat with Japan regarding the disputed Daioyu/Senkaku archipelago. On the 8th September, aChinese trawler crew were arrestedfor allegedly ramming into two Japanese coast guard boats within close proximity to the islands. Although the crew was released a week later, China began restricting rare earth element exports, which specifically targeted Japan for two months.
The export embargo of rare earths to Japan presented a surprising vulnerability, prompting an urgent strategy to diversify. At the time of the incident,90 percent of Japanese rare earth importswere from China. A decade afterwards, this had been minimised to 58 percent.
Tokyo prioritised the development of new technology which either reduced consumption of rare earths or used alternative resources, investing in overseas mining operations, and stockpiling critical resources. Abudget of JPY100 billion($1.2 billion at the time) was prepared for this mineral strategy the month following the dispute, demonstrating the perceived urgency. Through this multi-pronged strategy, dependency on Chinese imports was reduced and future short term supply shocks were mitigated.
The 2010 dispute identified the threat of China weaponising critical resources. Beijing’s willingness to wield their monopoly to leverage concessions in other areas has motivated a number of governments to devise mineral strategies and to diversify their supply lines. The Japanese model demonstrates that, through urgent and coordinated efforts, diversification is possible.
Yet, after a decade, reliance remained at 60 percent of rare earth imports, underscoring the scale of the challenge faced. Thelast three US government administrationshave developed critical mineral strategies, but 60 percent of US designated critical minerals remain dominated by China. It is also clear that Beijing will not concede their control without resistance. In December 2023, the US began ramping up their efforts to process critical minerals domestically.
Through time and practice, China has developed an absolute advantage over other states in the knowledge and technology needed to process these elements. To slow any attempt by the US to close this gap, China quickly incorporated anexport banon its extraction and processing technology. However, whilst other nations may be late to the game, there are still opportunities to reduce the Chinese monopoly.
Developing their own processing plants and importing from other nations will help to diversify away from China. Critical mineral rich African nations are already the centre of this growing market. The global revenues from the extraction of four critical minerals – cobalt, lithium, nickle, and copper – over the next 25 years is estimated toreach $16trillion, of which Sub-Saharan nations stand to reap over 10 per cent from this. This is testament to the large found and untapped reserves of critical minerals on the continent. There remains an opportunity due to the large reserves of resources outside of China’s borders to scale up critical mineral processing and reduce Beijing’s dominance.","May 10, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/resource-dependency-exploring-the-chinese-monopoly-of-critical-minerals/,Oliver Lee-Pearson,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
(ANALYSIS) Freedom of Speech Under the Meloni Administration,"A recent defamation case has come to the fore of the Italian political landscape. The case concerns the journalist Giulia Cortese and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in what a Milanese judgehas ruledearlier this July are defamatory remarks amounting to ‘body-shaming.’ The remarks in question – abarbfrom Cortese mocking Meloni’s height – may appear insignificant, but this lawsuit lies represents and fits within a broader pattern of actions taken by the current Italian administration against freedom of speech in Italy. This is not the first time that Meloni has litigated against her critics during her Premiership. Another notable example is hersuccessful defamation lawsuitagainst famed journalist and author Roberto Saviano. Whilethe increasing number of defamatory lawsuits against journalists in Italygives pause for concern, the greater systemic assault against Italian freedom of speech runs far deeper, necessitating a greater understanding of freedom of speech within Italy.
First, it is important to establish the origins of contemporary Italian freedom of speech as being born out of – and in contrast to – the censorship of Benito Mussolini’s fascist government.Time Magazinecarried adenunciation of such censorshipback in 1927 fromChicago Daily Newscorrespondent George Seldes for, “reducing the Italian press to utter subservience to Dictator Mussolini… Mr. Seldes went on to tell how foreign correspondents, under threats of expulsion, effective because they are feared, are bullied by the censorship.” Following the Italian Civil War, the republican government would ratify a new constitution articulating free speech rights.Art. 21of the constitution declared, “anyone has the right to freely express their thoughts in speech, writing, or any other form of communication. The press may not be subjected to any authorisation or censorship.”Art.17compliments these rights, specifying that, “citizens have the right to assemble peaceably and unarmed. No previous notice is required for meetings, including those held in places open the public. In case of meetings held in public places, previous notice shall be given to the authorities, who may prohibit them only for proven reason of security or public safety.”
Strikingly, this articulation of the right to freedom of speech mirrors the international recognition to this right that would follow the Italian Constitution in 1948. The definition of freedom of speech found withinArt. 19of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) expresses that, “everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”Art. 20compliments this, establishing that, “everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.” While Italy was not a member of the United Nations at the time, and therefore could not vote on this matter, the document’s significance indeeply influencing and providing the framework for international human rights lawcannot go unmentioned while discussing the post-war formation of Italian freedom of speech. Italy was on the same page as those who ratified the UDHR as it pertained to this right in this post war period. In this context, one can go on to better analyze the more systematic actions of the current Italian administration vis-à-vis the post-war establishment of Italian freedom of speech.
The defamation lawsuits brought by Meloni are noteworthy in themselves; however, these individual cases are indicative of the system as a whole. That is to say, the actions of the current Italian government systemically run counter to the already established roots of Italian freedom of speech. Take, for instance, the assertion that it is not just Meloni herself seemingly making use of Italian defamation laws to go after critics: her administration hasemployed defamation lawsuitsto such ends as seen in the case brought by Agriculture Minister – Meloni’s brother-in-law – Francesco Lollobrigida against political philosopher Donatella Di Cesare. Di Cesareopinedthat this case, brought against her after shedrew a comparisonbetween comments by Lollobrigida and Mein Kampf, demonstrates that, “the aim of defamation trials like mine is not just to intimidate… Those who draw attention to the movement’s fascist roots are being punished.” Individual instances of wielding defamation lawsuits against critical voices and efforts by the Meloni administration to increase the consequences for defamation have garnered attention for their apparent front to freedom of speech. Senator Alberto Balboni – a member of Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia (FdI) ruling coalition party –introduced legislation in 2023that has been revealed to maintain potential lengthy, years-long prison sentences for defamation, while simultaneously incurring a ban on working as a journalist for up to six months in addition to raising the fine for defamation by thousands of euros.
Efforts by Meloni’s government to alter and utilize defamation laws to their own benefit aside, her administration has progressively sought to totallyremake the publicly-owned broadcasterRadiotelevisione italiana (RAI), leading tobacklash and a strikethis past May at RAI. RAI journalist and head of the Italian National Press Federation, Vittorio di Trapanistated, “we have always fought against every effort to gag freedom of speech, but I want to make it plain that what has been happening in recent months is unprecedented.” The strike succeeded another incident at RAI when an anticipated talk with Antonio Scurati, professor and author ofM: Son of the Century– a book critically chronicling the rise to power of Mussolini and the Fascists, wasabruptly cancelled before its April 25thairing– the same date as Italy’s Festa della Liberazione from fascism – for ‘editorial reasons.’ Scurati was adamant as to what he believed the reasoning for the abrupt cancellation was though,stating toLe Mondethat, “this government persists in its attempts to rewrite history and impose its hegemony on the country by force and political leverage,” continuing to assert that, “this incident reveals that its conception of power is not exactly dictatorial, but rather authoritarian…” While Melonisought to abateany notion of censorship by posting Scurati’s speech in full to her Facebook page, the perception of censorship nonetheless remained. The systemic assault against the freedom of speech goes beyond efforts to quell certain individuals and remake the public broadcaster though.
Speech in public spaces has likewise become a target under the current government both by law and force. Shocking scenes from a pro-Palestinian demonstration sparked outrage this past February in Pisa whenpolice beat schoolchildren attending the protest, withReutersreportingthat teachers at Pisa’s Russoli high school – near to where the demonstration took place – stated that, “we found boys and girls from our classes trembling and shocked… from the beatings they received.” Likewise, The ability to publicly demonstrate in Italy – a cornerstone of freedom of speech – hasbeen subjected to legislative constriction and control. The current administration has sought to reshape laws concerning public demonstration –attempting to enhance the penalties for those found to be in violations of increasingly stricter controls concerning public protests– all in the name of ‘security.’ This ‘security bill,’ termeddisegno di legge 1660 or just ‘ddl sicurezza’in Italian, has been snaking its way through the Italian legislature – passing through parliament’s lower house this past September and awaiting approval in the upper house. Meloni’s administrationhas already increased the penaltiesfor anyone found to have damaged artwork by thousands of euros in light of a spate of recent environmental protests. In tandem with these penalties,‘ddl sicurezza’ would further criminalizethose resisting arrest, protesters blocking roads and so called ‘strategic’ public works, and those within the justice system engaging in hunger strikes alongside other forms of passive resistance. All the while, the advancement of this ‘security bill’ through the legislature continues sparking public demonstrations.
This all paints a rather grim picture of the current state and trajectory of Italian freedom of speech, and it would be easy enough to discount all of this as being dramatic – especially giventhe normalization of Meloni and her partyon behalf of the EU. There is a veritable orchestra of alarm bells being rung by NGOs on Italy in this regard though. Reporters Sans Frontières(RSF) notes in theirAnalysis 2024, Europe – Central AsiaToxic Kremlin influence reaches EU,that while not ranking among the bottom three in Europe for press freedoms alongside Hungary, Malta, and Greece – nonetheless, “Giorgia Meloni’s Italy (46th) has also fallen five places.” While it may come as some relief that RSF does not rank Italy as low as such aforementioned standouts, the descent in Italy’s ranking can be attributed to the factors covered thus far, withRSF notingthe fear of defamation against journalists and public figures by politicians that abounds in Italy. The raising of red flags by NGOs goes beyond concerns for journalists though.
Amnesty International noted Italy’s constriction of rights to freedom of expression in 2023, specifically making mention of the aforementioned laws discussed to clamp down on public protests along with instances of excessive force by the police against protestors. Striking at the heart of the discourse as it pertains to publicly protesting though, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention –a legally binding conventionthat seeks to safeguard an environment adequate to  one’s health and well-being – has staunchly criticized efforts to curtail public demonstrations against climate change in Italy. Writing in the Italian news publicationDomaniin the context of Italy’s increasing restrictions against environmental protests, Special Rapporteur Michel Forststated that, “illegal actions are sometimes legitimate. While one may disagree with some of these actions, acknowledging their legitimacy is key to understand what environmental activists stand for and why they fight for it that way. If governments fail to understand that, they will fail to adequately respond to civil disobedience,” later continuing to note that, “When peaceful protests are banned, protesting becomes an act of civil disobedience. Climate activists should not be banned from a city for that. We should all be concerned of where that leads us.”
Therefore, while defamation cases over perceived slights may certainly appear innocuous enough in their presentation, taken collectively with the government exerting control over the public broadcaster and laws framed around ‘protecting’ cultural heritage by restricting protestors, these efforts represent an assault against the very idea of modern Italian freedom of speech. Italian freedom of speech, that very same freedom of speech that was born out of opposition to Italian Fascism, having been in lockstep with the UDHR since its foundation, is endangered by these efforts in tandem. While there have been protests against this seeming attack, greater action must be taken now to guarantee what have and always will be self-evident rights to all.

The Problem of Over-tourism in Europe,"In recent times,travellers in Europe have been chased by locals and targeted with water pistols, while ‘go back’ slogans have been making headlines. Spain is the latest country to experience this. Thousands of Spaniards have been holding demonstrations in the areas most popular among visitors, chanting,”tourists go home” and going on hunger strikes. However, this surge of acrimonious behaviour is not directed to the tourists but at over-tourism which has failed to be managed sustainably.
Europe, home to five of the ten most popular places in the world to visit, is undergoing an upheaval. The locals of Venice, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Canary Islands, Lisbon, Athens are struggling with inadequate infrastructures, overcrowded streets and pollution, all topped with the prohibitive property prices. While tourism has been the economic driver of such cities, it now threatens the quality of life of its residents.With 73.9 million tourists in Spainin the first nine months of 2024, the question of over-tourism and its damaging impact on climate change and residents have garnered attention in Europe.
The alreadyover-utilised, drought-prone Spainhas 61 percent of its surface water available and 45 percent of its underground water contaminated. Similarly, Italy is facing an acute shortage of water. In 2022, almost 40 percent of Italy’s agricultural sector was at risk owing to record low water levels.  On the other hand, parts of Central Europe —namely, Romania, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic— endured therainiest monsoon ever recorded.
According to theEuropean Environment Agency reportof 2023, coastal areas would experience an increase in the mean and extreme sea levels. The countries of Southern Europe would see a rise in droughts and fire hazards. This anticipation was met withwildfires, primarily in Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, which burned 500,000 hectares of land. Moreover, Europe has been impacted by heat waves and has seen a surge in temperature-related health issues.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared thisclimate crisis a public health crisis, the first of its kind. This phenomenon of climate change not only hampers people’s living conditions but also threatens the national economies. The loss of infrastructure, extended pressure on natural resources and dire effects on all the sectors of production can lead to a sharp economic decline. Such a situation coupled with mass tourism has pushed many countries to the brink.
The housing crisis is another matter of grave concern. Rent prices that were already skyrocketing pre-COVID-19 have surpassed the affordable capacity of an average income earner. For example, rentin Barcelonahas increased by 68 percent in the past decade and property prices by 38 percent. At the same time, inGermany, there is a shortage of 800,000 apartments, with hundreds of applicants on waiting lists. InFranceand Sweden, soaring prices for owning houses are discouraging the younger demographic from buying them. In the case ofGreece, owners have switched to short-term rentals over long-term ones due to lack of affordability. Considering the ever-growing demand for Airbnb and rental properties among tourists, property owners are evicting their tenants and subletting their apartments to earn extra income. This has perpetuated forced displacement of thousands of local residents and an overall deterioration of the quality of life in some of the most popular tourist destinations. Moreover, as thousands of travellers flock to ancient cities, they are putting pressure on health services, waste management and other essential amenities which are not used to such a strain.
The protests and their widespread coverage have compelled the governments to take stringent measures against over-tourism. Some policies have already been implemented, some have been circulating for years, and some have been recently proposed to calm down the angered citizens and rectify the worsened situation.
Since August 2024, Venice has decided tolimit the number of peopleto 25 for guided tour groups and ban loudspeakers to prevent any disturbances caused by crowds to the locals. These restrictions have also been extended to the islands of Murano, Burano and Torcello, and failing to comply with instructions would result in a €25-€30 fine. Earlier, in April 2024, Venice became the first city to charge a symbolic €5 entry fee to limit the number of day-trippers. Though, still in its initial stages of execution, the strategy has shown little promise to tackle the heavy amount of tourists during peak seasons. Greece has adopted similar measures,imposing a €20 levyon cruise ship visitors in the islands of Santorini and Mykonos during the summers. The revenue collected will be used to improve the infrastructure of the islands. The officials of the overcrowded Croatian city of Dubrovnik, in which only 30 per cent of the Old Town is occupied by the locals, have decided toreclaim the landfor the local inhabitants. It aims at banning new rental permits and short-term leases.
Another tourist hotspot, Amsterdam, has taken drastic steps to lower the visitor numbers. It hasbanned the construction of new hotels, allowing the construction of a new, more sustainable building only if another structure closes. In such a case, the newly built hotel cannot exceed the number of hotel rooms which were in the previous property. The government also seeks to reduce the cruise ship entering the capital by half by 2028. These actions are a part of the successful long-term tourism campaign, announced in 2022. In order to avoid voyeuristic tourism and unwanted behaviour, the government banned smoking in the red-light district. This‘stay away’ campaignwas initially targeted at British men aged 18-35. The campaign has now spread all over the city, banning smoking in the city centre and planning to relocate brothels to the outskirts of the city.
Copenhagen has also been in the spotlight for adopting an entirely different approach to handle the situation throughCopenPay. CopenPay is a pilot scheme which ran from July 15 to August 11, 2024 wherein tourists were encouraged to make sustainable decisions. Adamant that they need to change the tourists’ mindset and not make their city inhospitable at the same time, they launched this green economy initiative. CopenPay rewards for participating in activities such as cycling, volunteering at urban farms and clean-up drives while indulging in exploring the city.
In light of recent events, Barcelona has called for ashutdown of short-term rentalsto tourists by 2028 to address the housing crisis. It has announced to eliminate 10,000 registered short-term rental listings, making it one of the most aggressive policies in Airbnbs in the world. However, it is not alone. Many countries have and are restricting the short-term rental regulations. The UK unveiled its planning permission before the general elections of 2024 which would be required to rent a property for more than 90 days. France has approvedanti-Airbnb billto accommodate its citizens’ demands for affordable housing. The legislation which was in circulation since April 2023 aims to bring down the tax allowance for tourist rentals, from 71 per cent to 50 per cent, with a cap of €77,000. The bill also slashes tax breaks for non-classified tourist properties, bringing them to 30 per cent from 50 percent, with a cap of €15,000.
The outrage and concern of the locals have been met with some measurable steps taken by their respective governments. However, the question lies whether they are enough.Many experts are arguing that imposing additional taxation is non-effective in lowering arrivals. A person planning a holiday will seldom get deterred by the trivial amount of tax. The ban on Airbnb might resolve the housing crisis in the short-run, but can lead to the problem of gentrification in the long-run.
Moreover,many scholars argue that discouraging touriststhrough campaigns, and targeted policies would have a negative impact on the economies of countries. It would hamper the employment opportunities in the tourism sectors, and reduce their global visibility. The government needs to strike a balance between promoting its country as a tourist destination while upholding the interests and security of its citizens. Most importantly, they need to take climate changes related to tourism into effect, along with the economic conditions. A viable solution to this issue would be sustainable tourism, an option explored and executed by Copenhagen. Another possible resolution is the promotion ofcultural tourism.The governments by doing so could not only promote their cultural heritage but also support environmental conservation practices and local communities.

Rise in Digital Influence Operations: An Analysis into Iranian Disinformation Campaigns,"As news consumption has increasingly moved online, concerns about the credibility and reliability of online information have grown. This digital shift has sparkedinterestin disinformation as a driver for political influence or to simply mislead. Disinformation, as defined by theUS Department of Homeland Security, refers to the deliberate dissemination of false information. Alongside this, misinformation involves the unintentional sharing of inaccuracies. According to theGlobal Risks Report, misinformation and disinformation are seen as significant threats for 2024. With clickbait and sensationalized content dominating social media platforms, these tactics have turned into a profitable industry focused on attracting viewers, often at the expense of truth.
Despite social media being theleast trusted news sourceglobally since 2016, many internet users still turn to these platforms for current affairs, inadvertently exposing themselves to fake news. The Iranian government has been notably active in this domain, withMicrosoftestimating that it conducted 24 cyber-enabled influence operations throughout 2022. The threat of disinformation reaches across civil society, international organizations, academia, government and the private sector, making it a key concern in global risk assessments.
Iran’s early engagement with the internet fostered an environment of open discourse, especially through internet cafes and online platforms. However, this openness quickly shifted into a landscape ofcensorship, especially after the 2009 Green movement, which saw significant crackdown on dissent. In contrast, Iran has increasingly harnessed digital platforms for propaganda and diplomatic purposes. The Islamic Republic has a long-standing history of information warfare, highlighted by Ayatollah Khamenei’s 2019statementthat promoting content is a crucial international weapon against adversaries. Various entities, including the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Iranian Intelligence services, are actively involved in these digital campaigns, often obscuring their ties to state authorities to appear independent from the state.
John Brennan, the former CIA director, hasnotedthe growing use of disinformation as a tool of warfare by various nations. Disinformation sites typically do not rely solely on fake content; rather, mix real information with exaggerated or misleading claims, making it difficult for audiences to discern the truth. The rise of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has further simplified the creation of deceptive content, posing significant challenges for public discourse.OpenAIhas reported efforts to identify and shut down covert influence operations utilizing AI models for content generation, translation and engagement simulation. Among the disrupted operations was one linked to Iran, known as the International Union of Virtual Media, which utilized open AI to generate and translate articles for publication on its websites. Iranian influence operations often plagiarize news from established news outlets to lend credibility to low-effort websites masquerading as independent news sources.
Iran’s disinformation strategies are politically motivated, primarily targeting the US, Israel, Iranian opposition figures, and rival Gulf states. For instance, Iranian cyber operations against Israel have had broader repercussions affecting the US, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. The digital landscape has become saturated with Iranian propaganda, exemplified by platforms like Nile Net Online, one of over 70 sites identified byReutersthat circulate Iranian disinformation while posing as legitimate news outlets.The impact of disinformation runs deep, especially inelectoral processes, where it can exacerbate societal polarization and provoke political unrest in democratic nations, thereby invoking government response that can potentially undermine free speech and human rights.
Iran employs tactics that often exaggerate its moral authority while minimizing domestic issues, all aimed at furthering its foreign policy objectives. The primary targets of these campaigns are Western nations and Israel, with strategies designed to stir contempt, polarize opinions, and manipulate political dynamics in favor of Iranian interests. For example, Facebook recently removed 82 accounts and pages linked to Iranian disinformation efforts, which had gained over a million followers in just a month, according toReuters.
Unlike Russian disinformation methods that rely heavily on outright fabrication, Iranian operations typically offerdistorted versionsof the truth that enhance Tehran’s image and policy goals. Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center reported Iranian efforts to create discord among American voters leading up to elections, with several Iranian hackers facing charges related to information warfare. Investigations revealed that an Iranian group operated four fake websites posing as American news outlets, amplifying divisive narratives.
Additionally, the use of disinformation and cyber warfare tactics toinfluencethe 2020 US presidential elections is another example where Iran-backed groups circulated anti-US, anti-Trump content online due to Donald Trump’s disdain towards the Iran nuclear agreement as opposed to Joe Biden’s support for it in an effort to influence the electoral process. These disinformation tactics have a global reach, with content translated in various languages to target audiences worldwide. The risks associated with such campaigns are considerable, including censorship, societal polarization, civil unrest, violence, and theerosion of human rights, as well as heightened threats of extremist attacks and armed conflict.
Disinformation campaigns play a significant role in shaping public opinion and political discourse. In early 2023, over 40% of US news consumers encounteredfalse informationabout the COVID-19 pandemic, a trend mirrored in Slovakia regarding the war in Ukraine. These statistics highlight how targeted disinformation can influence political landscapes and underscore the importance of public vigilance.
In response to escalating Iranian information warfare, the US government has implementedsanctionsand designated the IRGC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The IRIB has also faced sanctions as part of broader efforts to curb Iranian influence in the global media sphere. While Iran’s disinformation campaigns may not be as extensive as those from Russia, they have had a significant impact by exploiting volatile political issues. For example, afabricated storyin 2016 prompted Pakistan’s then defense minister to issue threats of nuclear retaliation against Israel, later revealed as part of an Iranian disinformation plot. Such state-sponsored disinformation efforts can escalate tensions in international relations and contribute to increased cyber offenses, leading to a more volatile geopolitical environment.
Given the sheer volume of information circulating on social media, combating disinformation presents a formidable challenge. National agencies and human resources alone cannot effectively tackle this issue; it is essential to raise public awareness about how to identify and report false information. Current efforts to combat disinformation, including new cybersecurity regulations, often struggle to keep up with the rapid speed and volume of online disinformation. There has been an increase in development of applications, websites and organizations focused on identifying and addressing influence operations utilizing misinformation and disinformation.
While social media platforms can swiftly remove accounts known for spreading disinformation, dismantling entire websites requires collaboration among law enforcement, internet service providers, and web infrastructure companies. The Iran Disinformation Project has raised concerns over attacks on allegedly pro-Iranian US journalists, damaging the credibility of organizations like the Global Engagement Center andhindering effortsto identify Iranian digital influence networks.
To efficiently combat disinformation, it is crucial to understand the impact of these operations.Brookingshas proposed the “Breakout Scale”, a model for measuring the influence operations based on observable, replicable, verifiable and available data. The scale is divided into six categories ranging from low-level transfers to the same platform to high-profile individuals and posts inciting a policy response. For instance, the disinformation operation targeting Pakistan’s defense minister in 2016 can be classified as a category five operation, which involves amplification by high-profile individuals, such as political candidates. This scale underscores the significance of influential figures in boosting engagement with disinformation online.
As the geopolitical landscape evolves, the threat posed by Iranian disinformation remains a pressing concern. Microsoft highlights the ongoing risk of cyberattacks from Iranian groups targeting critical infrastructure and domestic processes, emphasizing the urgent need for vigilance and proactive measures in countering these tactics. The complex interplay of disinformation, misinformation, and the rapidly changing digital environment presents significant challenges to public discourse and democratic processes globally. Addressing these challenges will require a coordinated effort among governments, civil society, and the public to build a more informed and resilient information ecosystem. In the absence of robust regulations and safeguards addressing AI and disinformation amidst rapid technological advancements, a greater effort is required in educating the general public to recognize and resist influence operations and understand the credibility and the integrity of the information shared online.

European Affairs: Central Europe’s Flood Defense and Storm Boris,"Violent weather patterns across Europe have become increasingly common with record breaking heat waves, frequent hurricanes, and cross-border storms. Over the course of the two week period fromSeptember 13th to September 27th, storm Boris poured over125 centimetersof rain, more than two to four times the typical average of September. Numerous countries across central Europe were deeply affected by the torrential rain. Even with substantial investment in flood defense, citizens of Poland, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Romania wereevacuatedfrom their homes as flood infrastructure deteriorated. There were numerous homes, roads, and bridges destroyed and several liveslostto the conditions of the storm, along with widespread power outages and damages to transport routes. Emergency services were stretched thin due to thousands of reports, yet some flood infrastructure proved itself adequate in protecting the population.
Prior to Boris, Vienna had invested and improved their flood management systems, and their infrastructure was able to successfully mitigate the extremerainfall event. Their flood defense system has the capability to withstand up to14,000 cubic meters of water. One implementation was theNew Danubechannel; the channel is normally closed, but is opened prior to expected floods, allowing relief to the Danube and diverting the risk of a flood. This waterway prevented flooding in 2013, where there was 11,000 cubic meters of water to withstand. Another system is theDanube Island, which was created from the material from the hollowed out channel, and acts as both flood protection and a recreational area. It also has a flood plain, which helps decrease the speed of run off water as well as storing some flood water. The combination of these two features assist in the prevention of the Danube river from flowing too quickly and over-filling. Simultaneously, Vienna has constructed a system of dykes on both banks of the Danube and reinforced and raised the existingones, which allows for elevated water levels in preparation for extreme events. In Vienna, Storm Boris affected underground transport after the Wienfluss spilled over into the railway. Without the altercations made to the flood defense systems in Vienna, there would have been similar levels of flooding where communities were evacuated, infrastructure was destroyed, and lives were lost as other parts of Europe experienced.
The entirety of Austria has varying levels of flood defense with structures such as dykes being the most common. There have also been an increase in emergency planning in order to notify those at risk and to assist in evacuations. These take the forms of hazard zone planning, where preemptive measures are taken to communicate with those that reside inat-risk areas. Individual preparedness is a critical component in Austria’s defense, but more systematic methods include coordinated efforts of controlling river basins, dykes, and monitoring the flow of rivers by organizations. TheDanube Flood Control Agency(DHK) is in charge of flood prevention for Vienna and Lower Austria. They maintain the operation of the dams, dykes, and other plants that maintain the‘preventative and protective’measures of the system. Upper Austria also maintains Hydraulic systems for the prevention of flooding.
The rest of Central Europe also faced similar challenges as Vienna during Storm Boris because of its heavy rainfall. For instance, Poland faced extensive flooding in the south western regions ofSilesia and Lower Silesia. In Lower Silesia, 1,600 people were evacuated from Kłodzko, while in the same area a dam on the Biala Ladeckia River failed, causing destructive flooding. The lack of success within Polish infrastructure presents an alarming problem for future storms. Throughout the Boris,thousands of people faced power outagesbecause of the systems being overwhelmed as well as damage to power cables. While the Czech Republic’s Environment Ministry labeled Storm Boris as a1-in-50 year event, South Bohemia suffered a severe level of flooding leading to a dam bursting. This failure of infrastructure caused an exacerbation of flooding, where there were 13,500 individualsevacuatedwith over 600 being rescued from harm. The flood management systems of Central Europe had been seemingly upgraded for the purpose of protecting and preventing flooding; however, these systems were unable to fulfill their duties completely in the face of the unprecedented scale of Boris. Investments into large scale flood defense that are present in Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Central Europe are all effective during low-levels of flooding; although, there must also be more preventative measures taken for national flood defense to be effective, such as having a prepared population and an effective alert system, for there to be a strong flood defense.
TheLower Raciborz Reservoirin Poland was a crucial component in securing the protection of Opole and Wroclaw. The reservoir was able to flatten the wave of flooding on the Oder River; with its robust ability to hold185 million cubic meters of flood waterit was able to withstand the heavy rain. In addition to this, the Polish government’s early warning system and ability to effectively declare a state of natural disaster allowed for enough time to carry out evacuations in high-risk areas. In the Czech Republic, similar early warning systems were able to prevent increased harm, and their retention basins and artificial ponds that collect storm water were able to withstand parts of the flood.  Furthermore, they have begun ecosystem restoration projects to improve natural flood management. In Hungary, the government deployed thousands of individuals to work on water and disaster management. They also have30 reservoirs with a total capacity of 721 million cubic meters, and there were39,335 sandbagsplaced along areas at risk during the storm. These large scale flood defense operations were able to mitigate disaster along numerous river systems.
The various methods of flood defense were proven effective in the face of the destructive effects of Storm Boris. Yet, the torrent showed that there needs to be further resources placed in flood management in order to readily prevent and protect other locations in each country. The continued development of harsh storms internationally has put a heavy reliance on governments to strengthen and improve current systems. Simultaneously, individual awareness particularly for those located in zones prone to disaster must be enhanced, in order to streamline defense operations should disasters occur. The mechanical processes in Vienna illustrate potential methods to control the level of water throughout the Danube varying from the new channel to the construction of flood banks. The non-mechanical processes in Poland and the Czech Republic show the importance of alert systems that allow for mass evacuations for individuals in high-risk areas.

The Far-Right’s Shocking Campaign in São Paulo’s Mayoral Race,"The 2024 municipal elections in Brazil highlighted significant political dynamics, particularly in São Paulo, the country’s center of political and economic power. With aGDPcomparable to that of Morocco and a labor market larger than the rest of Brazil combined, São Paulo plays a central role in shaping the national economy and political landscape. This election saw intense polarization, mirroring broader trends in Brazilian politics, and concluded with centrist mayor Ricardo Nunes (MDB)defeatingleft-wing candidate Guilherme Boulos (PSOL) in the second round. However, one of the most remarkable figures to emerge was Pablo Marçal (PRTB), a businessman and digital influencer whose candidacy is often labeled as far-right due to his radicaldiscourse, which blends cultural conservatism, delegitimization of institutions, and antagonistic populism.
His rhetoric emphasizes hyper-individualism, framing personal success as a moral imperative tied to entrepreneurial achievement while portraying traditional democratic institutions as ineffectual or corrupt. This aligns with broader far-right strategies that seek to erode public trust in governance structures while amplifying the role of the “strong individual.” Although Marçal’s relationship with the PRTB—a smaller party lacking a distinct far-right identity—was more strategic than ideological, his campaign effectively leveraged these radical messages, combined with a performance tailored to digital audiences. Narrowly missing the second round — having garnered over1.7 million votesin the first — his candidacy not only reflects the diversification of far-right politics in Brazil but also underscores the growing role of digital platforms in reshaping political identities and mobilizing voters.
Pablo Marçal, who before the elections was best known for his activities as a coach and for selling online courses, had unsuccessfully tried to run for president in 2022 when theTSE (Superior Electoral Court) barred his candidacydue to the annulment of the party convention that nominated him. Following this setback, Marçal later attempted to run for a seat as a federal deputy, securing over 200,000 votes, but his candidacy wasimpugned, preventing him from taking office. However, in the São Paulo mayoral elections, he ascended to a new level of prominence. With his digital communication strategy, based on short and highly viral videos, the candidate gained visibility and garnered support, especially among those most dissatisfied withthe political status quo. Marçal evenadmittedthat these viral videos often influenced his actions. His campaign combined attacks on the “corrupt system,” simplified promises of solutions, and emotional appeals, which resonated with voters disillusioned with institutions and the political class. He positioned himself as an outsider who could bring drastic changes to the system, a role commonly played by contemporary populist leaders.
What is most striking is that he achieved his projection despite having his social media accountssuspendedby the Electoral Court in August, until the end of the election, due to accusations of “illicitly recruiting people to increase the visibility of his content” and encouraging the creation of “cuts” of his speeches, promoting a network of professional “cutters”. Despite having his accounts suspended, the candidate quickly created alternative profiles and surpassed all other candidates in follower count on Instagram.
In addition to his adeptness in utilizing social media, Marçal also drew attention by generating controversy through his confrontational approach during the campaign.He frequently used debate stages to launch personal attacks on his rivals, creating an intense rivalry with nearly all his opponents. This tension culminated in one of the election’s most emblematic moments when Marçaladmittedto using an ambulance—after being hit with a chair by José Luiz Datena (PSDB)—to “make a scene”. In a video filmed during a dinner with supporters, Marçal said he could have run to the hospital and withstood other attacks but chose to use the moment to generate media impact.
The most serious episode was the case of thefalse reportreleased on the eve of the election, which accused Guilherme Boulos of using cocaine. The report, which contained the signature of a deceased doctor, put Marçal in a delicate situation, with the possibility of being declared ineligible for seeking election for eight years, depending on the outcome of the investigations. In addition, Marçal tried to associate himself with international figures, such as Donald Trump, by sharing a supposed letter of support from an advisor to the former US president, which was laterdeniedby Trump’s team.
Despite missing out on the second round, Pablo Marçal’s candidacy was significant in that he managed to capture and channel the discontent of a meaningful portion of the electorate with traditional politics. The outcome of thefirst roundwas decided by a narrow margin, with the top three candidates—Mayor Ricardo Nunes, Guilherme Boulos, and Pablo Marçal—virtually tied in voter support. Marçal missed the second round by just over 1% of the vote, highlighting how tight the race was. However,with more than 1.7 million votes, Marçal has positioned himself as a rising figure in the political arena, reinforcing his potential for future contests.The October 2024 Quaest pollalready projects him with 18% of voting intentions for the 2026 presidential election, second only to Lula and ahead of Tarcísio de Freitas (current Governor of the State of São Paulo). This demonstrates his growth on the national scene and the relevance he has garnered with disaffected voters.
However, Valdemar Costa Neto, president of Jair Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party (PL),pointed outthat Marçal does not yet have enough strength to compete directly with Bolsonaro. Costa Neto pointed out that Marçal’s behavior during the campaign, marked by episodes of violence and personal attacks, could harm his consolidation as a viable alternative in the next election cycle, for whichBolsonaro is ineligible. In any case, the fact that Marçal is mentioned in the context of a possible presidential race is already a positive indication of his political visibility and relevance within the conservative spectrum. However, he faces challenges that could slow down this growth, such as the ongoing judicial investigations regarding the alleged falsification of a report against Boulos.
The rise of figures like Pablo Marçal raises important questions about the direction of politics in Brazil and globally. The combination of populism and aggressive digital strategies has proven its efficacy but poses considerable risks for democracy. Disinformation, personal attacks, and extreme polarization weaken political debate and reduce trust in democratic institutions. In Marçal’s case, the use of fake news and misleading narratives is a clear example of how such populist candidates can manipulate public perceptions to gain political advantages.
In a broader sense, we can see parallels between Marçal and figures likeJeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom, Beppe Grillo in Italy, and Donald Trump in the United States.These figures have used their social media platforms to channel mass popular dissatisfaction which in turn has catapulted them into political prominence and relevance. Marçal follows a similar model, and his ability to mobilize through social media makes him a leading figure for the future of Brazilian politics. Marçal, like Trump and Grillo, positions himself as an outsider who is not part of the political establishment and is therefore better placed to lead the masses against a corrupt system. Grillo did this by directly attacking established politicians in Italy, while Trump stood out for his aggressive rhetoric against the political elite in Washington. Marçal follows this line byattackingthe “communist consortium” — as he calls it — and other established political actors in Brazil. The rhetoric of these politicians emphasizes the traditional populist discourse of division between “the people” and “the elite.” They present themselves as the legitimate voice of a discontented population they seek to mobilize through emotional appeals. It is also not uncommon to see them adopt a direct approach to the public, often bypassing the traditional media and even discrediting it. Grillo, for example,used his blog and digital movementsto build the 5 Star Movement party. In contrast, Trump used Twitter as one of the main communication platforms during his campaign and presidency. Marçal follows a similar strategy, with strategies that include short videos and viral cuts to reach followers and maintain media attention.
It is important to remember that these figures exert pressure on democratic systems not only through disinformation or personal attacks but also by exploiting the very mechanisms of democracy to undermine its fundamental principles. They challenge institutional norms by pushing legal frameworks to the limit, circumventing traditional checks and balances, and taking advantage of loopholes to consolidate their power or weaken the opposition.Trump’s attemptsto challenge the US election results andGrillo’s rhetoricagainst Italy’s political elites illustrate how these leaders erode trust in democratic processes while continuing to act within them. This approach, often justified as a fight against corruption or systemic inefficiency, can destabilize public trust and set a dangerous precedent, weakening the institutions’ ability to safeguard democratic values.
The rise of Pablo Marçal is not an isolated case on the Brazilian scene but part of a global trend in which political outsiders use digital media and popular dissatisfaction to facilitate and solidify their candidacies. This strategy has been widely analyzed in other international contexts, asdiscussed by Césarino (2020), who mentions how social media enables new forms of populist political mobilization, facilitating direct communication between leaders and voters, often bypassing the traditional mediation of political institutions. Ultimately, Marçal’s candidacy, even if rendered unsuccessful, reflects growing political fragmentation and the search for a new political formula that challenges the established order. However, observing this phenomenon can serve as a warning; the consolidation of leaders based on strategies of digital manipulation and extreme polarization could result in even greater challenges for democracy, especially if these leaders can build coalitions broad enough to achieve power.

The MENA Region’s Culture of Repression of Dissent: Is a New ‘Arab Spring’ in Motion?,"Over the past years, authoritarian regimes in the  Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have devised unforeseen tactics and strategies to maintain their grip on power, despite expressions of dissent and discontent. More than a decade after the Arab Spring, issues including political corruption, economic disparity, and restricted liberties are remarkably similar to those that initially provoked revolutions in the region. Nowadays, and more than ever before, regimes are readily able to monitor and stifle resistance, particularly due to the availability of cutting-edge surveillance devices and censorship capabilities. The tenacity of youth activism, however, raises the question of whether such protests will recur and whether attempts to bring about political change could be effective today.
The Arab World has long sparked the interest of political researchers and analysts, particularly scholars examining patterns of authoritarianism in the MENA region. For a majority of experts, however, it is possible to trace back the current political climate in the region to a landmark series of events: the 2011 Arab Uprisings, commonly referred to as the ‘Arab Spring’. While the protests were once hailed as a pioneering attempt to achieve democracy and overthrow repressive regimes in the MENA region, it is important to mention that such efforts did not fully succeed in dismantling patterns of repression in several countries. Instead, over the years, authoritarian governments have devised even more advanced strategies to suppress dissent and maintain their grip on power – some of these strategies will be explored in what follows.
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the ‘Arab Spring’ was its rapid emergence and widespread influence, which ignited what can only be described as a ‘domino effect’ across the region. Initially perceived as isolated acts of opposition against individual regimes, the movement quickly transformed into a sweeping wave of protests, as dissatisfaction with totalitarian governments rippled through countries such as Egypt, Syria, Libya, Bahrain, and Yemen.
As for itsorigins, the series of revolts saw the light of day with Mohamed Bouazizi, a young Tunisian vegetable vendor. A victim of police harassment and a regime ridden with rampant corruption and poverty, Bouazizi set himself ablaze, triggering widespread local protests that called for the resignation of the country’s President, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. These protests successfully culminated in the ousting of Ben Ali. However, while Tunisia’s uprising was seen as a monumental victory, the momentum of change that followed was not as effective or lasting in other countries, with regimes in places like Egypt and Syria proving far more resistant.
Almost a decade after the Arab Spring, the political situation in the MENA region remains extremely volatile, with heightened governmental restrictions on freedom of expression in numerous countries. Recognizing the power that social media platforms hold in exposing truths, authoritarian governments have systematically focused on redesigning the internet as a tool for stifling dissent rather than for enabling its expression.
A common method implemented by such regimes involves the use oftransnational repression strategies—a state-led initiative to control exiled activists through cyber surveillance, threats, intimidation, and even violence. Said oppressive governments have even used embassies and consulates as “satellite stations,” where officials monitor citizens, impose restrictions on consular services, and occasionally exploit the presence of dissidents’ families abroad as leverage. Over the past years,global concern has increaseddue to the development of advanced technologies and their recurrent exploitation by specific regimes.
On October 2, 2018, for example,the murder of Saudi journalist and columnist Jamal Khashoggishook the world, raising concerns about the lengths that governments would go to silence dissidents. Prior to Khashoggi’s murder,Citizen Lab, a Canadian research team, found out that Saudi Arabia had been monitoring Khashoggi’s acquaintances withPegasus, a potent spyware program developed by NSO Group. As perthe Pegasus Project, a collaborative initiative with Amnesty International’s Security Lab, the spyware program works using “zero-click attacks”. In other words, while common malware requires specific action from users – such as clicking on suspicious links or emails – Pegasus does not require any user interaction. Additionally, its complex functionalities allow for it to monitor calls, track the user’s location, access the device’s camera and microphone, as well as save passwords and various data.
Among the individuals monitored was Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist and outspoken opponent of the Saudi regime who lived in Montreal. Together, Abdulaziz and Khashoggi were developing a social media initiative known as the “Bee Army,” which sought to thwart Saudi-sponsored accounts that supported the state and disparaged its opponents.
Moreover, countries like the UAE and Jordan implement expansive cybercrime and anti-terrorism legislation to stifle internet activism and criticism, frequently citing national security as an excuse for judicial action.
For instance, theFederal Decree-Law No. 5, created to combat cybercrime, is used in the United Arab Emirates to suppress internet speech and criminalize opposition using vague definitions such as “unlawful content.” Essentially, posts that criticize government allies or contain information deemed to challenge official authority are often considered acts of rebellion. Due to the expansive wording of this statute, severe penalties,such as life imprisonment,have been imposed, for championing political change or large fines for harming the UAE’s reputation.A well-known caseisAhmed Mansoor,an Emirati activist, who was notably targeted for his online support of human rights reform. He was arrested in 2017, kept in solitary confinement at Al Wathba prison, and given a ten-year sentence on imprecise charges pertaining to his activism, including “insulting” the UAE and harming its “reputation abroad.” Concerns over Mansoor’s treatment and the harsh conditions of his confinementprompted several UN experts to urge his release, drawing attention to his arrest on a global scale. Despite worldwide censure andglobalhunger strikes, Mansoor is still behind bars, exemplifying how the UAE uses anti-terror and cyber laws to stifle dissent and regulate online speech.
Similarly,Jordan’s Anti-terrorist Law No. 55gives police the authority to detain individuals over social media that is said to inspire “terrorism” or jeopardize international relations. Because of its ambiguity, which permits massive censorship, this rule has been used to arrest civilians, journalists, and activists for discussing sensitive political subjects.
The possibility of the re-emergence of a wave of upheavals in the MENA region can be largely determined by analyzingthe factors present in the original Arab Springandcomparing them to current ones. Some major key factors behind the previous series of revolts include economic instability, a corrupt political system, limited freedoms, as well as youth disenfranchisement.
In Egypt, for example, Hosni Mubarak’s elite-dominated political system and lack of economic opportunity infuriated young Egyptians. Theyouth-led revolutions forced Mubarak to resignin February 2011, but despite hopes for democratic improvements, political disillusionment heightened with the ascent ofAbdel Fattah el-Sisi, who restored an authoritarian climate reminiscent of the pre-Arab Spring era.Corruption in the administration and prevalent economic inequality were also factors in Libya’s involvement in the Arab Spring. The concentration of Libya’s riches in the hands of the ruling class under Muammar Gaddafi sparked outrage among the people. Gaddafi was overthrown and assassinated in 2011 after widespread demonstrations against his leadership turned into a civil war. But while groups wrestle for control, political unrest persists and the nation is still in disarray. Unlike other Arab Spring countries, however, the protests in Yemen and Syria ignited two prolonged civil wars, rather than political transitions. In the case of Syria, government repression under Bashar al-Assad led to the severe suppression of the 2011 protests against high unemployment rates, poor economic prospects, and limited freedoms. As for Yemen, economic hardship and corruption fueled protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s long-standing rule. Protesters cited poverty, joblessness, and an unequal distribution of resources as major grievances. The protests led to Saleh’s eventual resignation, but the country’s descent into a civil war ultimately yielded one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.
Economic instability, widespread corruption, and political disengagement persist in the MENA region as we know it today, fueling a degree of discontent much similar to the one observed in the previous Arab Spring. In 2019, Lebanon, for instance, witnessed a series of protests fueled by severe economic mismanagement, political corruption, and rampant inflation, hence echoing concerns similar to those of the original revolts. Likewise, in Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring, young people continue to face economic stagnation and a lack of opportunity, conditions that have remained largely unchanged and risk reigniting public dissent.
According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, prevalent corruption and poor economic management continue to halt significant progress and exacerbate inequality across a large portion of the region,which raises questions about the likelihood of further upheavals. Such recurrent economic and political struggles are further aggravated by oppressive regimes’ use of harsher tactics to quell opposition, as observed in Egypt and other post-Arab Spring nations. Despite the suppression, a number of experts—including World Bank analysts—argue thatif these underlying issues are not addressed, there is still a considerable risk of civil unrest as socioeconomic resentment grows. It is equally important, however, to take into account the major technological advances made over the past years, many of which clearly continue to aid authoritarian regimes in their quest to silence dissent.
Questions• What are some significant measures that global movements and organizations can implement to obstruct the violation of privacy of dissidents on behalf of authoritarian regimes?• Will governments develop new strategies, possibly focused on societal structures, to suppress dissent more effectively?• Can the ongoing efforts of the MENA region’s youth result in meaningful political change, or will authoritarian regimes continue to thwart such movements?

[Analysis] Rolling the Dice on the Development Road: Will Iraq and Türkiye Hit the Jackpot?,"Relations between Iraq and Türkiye have historically been strained. Water disputes over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers andunlawfulTurkish military operations against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in northern Iraq are just some of the challenges that have contributed to nearly a century oftensionsbetween the two countries.However, a meeting on April 22ndbetween Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan suggests a change is taking place. TheBaghdad summitappears to have laid the groundwork for a potential partnership, as both leaders expressed interest in moving beyond past conflicts to pursue strategic collaboration. This renewed interest in closer ties and collaboration is further demonstrated by the signing of26 memoranda of understanding, through which Iraq and Türkiye pledge to jointly develop projects across key areas. These include initiatives aimed at securing vital water resources for Iraq, developing joint education programs, and facilitating tourism between the two countries, among others. These projects are significant and promise to bring meaningful benefits to both nations; however, the economic initiatives are drawing the most attention, with theDevelopment Roadproject taking the spotlight.
The Development Road is a visionary project aimed at creating a new, faster trade route linking Europe to Asia through Iraq and Türkiye. Starting at the under-construction al-Faw megaport — set to become the region’s largest port — the route will traverse Iraq’s highways and railways before reaching Türkiye’s key Ovaköy junction. From there, goods will continue their journey to Europe via the Mersin Port or the Kapıkule land passage. This new route is expected to cut transit times to just 25 days — compared to 35 days via the Suez Canal and 45 days around the Cape of Good Hope — providing a major boost to trade between Europe and Asia.
Besides providing advantages for those who will use the route, the Development Road promises to offer significant benefits to Iraq and Türkiye as the countries leading the initiative. First, it is expected to position both nations as key commercial hubs, potentially increasing their influence in international trade and global affairs. Second, the project is anticipated togenerate an estimated $4 billion in revenue and create over 100,000 new jobs, providing a significant boost to both countries’ economies and offering them a path out of their current crises.
However, beyond geopolitical and economic benefits, the Development Road is also expected to grant Iraq and Türkiye valuable opportunities to advance domestic objectives. For thefragileBaghdad government, the Development Road presents a chance to foster long-term domestic stability. The substantial revenue generated by the initiative is expected to make stability a more attractive goal for all local actors. This could encourage figures traditionally opposed to the government — such asMuqtada al-Sadr, the influential Shiite cleric and politician behind much ofIraq’s recent instability— to reconsider their positions and seek compromises with the government, ultimately advancing the project and benefitting the Iraqi people.
At the same time, the initiative’s promise to reduce goods transportation times between Europe and Asia is anticipated to elevate Iraq’s stability to a matter of global priority. This logistical advantage could, in fact, prompt global powers — particularly Western nations — to take a more active interest in Iraq’s situation. Such attention could play in favour of Baghdad, as it may gain support from international powers in its efforts to maintain security and stability within its borders.
For Türkiye, on the other hand, the Development Road presents an opportunity to address its longstanding Kurdishissue. For decades, the Ankara government has opposed peaceful calls for Kurdish independence, not only within Türkiye but also in Iraq. In fact, it has worked to prevent the emergence of an independent Iraqi Kurdistan, fearing that such a development would inspire similar demands or calls for annexation within its own Kurdish population. However, the Development Road appears to mitigate this risk as its success relies on a unified Iraq, potentially quashing Kurdish peaceful demands in Iraq and, by extension, in Türkiye.
Nonetheless, the project also provides Türkiye with a chance to counter separatist demands expressed through armed resistance. With much of the Road passing through PKK strongholds, the need for security creates an opportunity for the Turkish government to launch full-scale operations and dismantle the organisation. An opportunity it will likely take, as a victory would create the conditions for a final resolution to the Kurdishissueon itsownterms.
As observed, the potential benefits of the Development Road are considerable. However, the challenges to its successful completion are equally significant, with security issues emerging as the greatestmenace. In fact, both Iraq and Türkiye face threats from armed groups that could present obstacles to the project’s construction.
ISIS — although reduced to approximately1,000-2,500 militants— remains a destabilising force in the region. At present, the group’s presence and activities are mainly confined to areas outside the designated route for the Development Road. This, however, does not rule out the possibility of them extending their operational range and resorting to sabotage or acts of violence to disrupt the project. ISIS may be motivated to carry out such attacks, as theheftyrevenues expected from the project could represent a threat to the group’s existence — especially given the high likelihood that these would be used to finance counterterrorism efforts. As such, the Islamist group may attempt preemptive strikes to disrupt the project’s timeline and secure itsinterests.
In a similar manner, the PKK may make use of violence as the Development Road threatens itsinterests— if not its survival. The group holds many of its strongholds in areas between Iraq and Türkiye — precisely where the Development Road is set to pass. This factor makes them a primary target not only for the Ankara government — with whom they have been “at war” since the 1980s — but also for the Baghdad government, as both countries aim to secure the area for the project. The threat of large-scale coordinated operations from Turkish and Iraqi forces could push the PKK to escalate its activities, targeting multiple locations along the Road and possibly across both countries — with Türkiye being the main target given the widespread presence of PKK cells across the country. Such escalation would in all likelihood force both governments to prioritise national security over the Development Road, delaying — if not thwarting — the project’s realisation.
In view of these threats, Turkish and Iraqi authorities must act smartly and quickly, not just to weaken these groups but tofullydismantle them. Failing to do so could compromise the success of the project.
Obstacles to the Development Road’s realisation may emerge from not only security threats but also political dynamics involving local and regional actors. One actor that could present an obstacle is the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Although controlling the area where the final 15 km of the Road between Iraq and Türkiye will pass, the KRG has been left out of any discussions regarding the project. This exclusion has caused discontent in Erbil, with Kurdish authorities threatening that they may withhold construction approval unless recognised as active stakeholders in the project. Thiswarninghas not so far prompted any response from Ankara and Baghdad, though its character is well understood. It is, in fact, very improbable that the two governments would search for alternatives, as bypassing these 15 kilometers would mean restructuring the layout of the Road — which translates to extra costs and delays. As such, it seems clear that if the project is to be achieved, Iraq and Türkiye will need to engage with the KRG and make some concessions to secure its cooperation and keep the project moving forward.
“On many occasions, we affirmed our support for all efforts to establish the [Development Road]. [However], just like without Faw [Port] and Basra, there will be no [Development] road without Kurdistan[‘s involvement]”
Another actor that could hamper the project is Iran. For the time being, the Tehran government is uninterested in the project,  as it is preoccupied with other more pressing matters — such asthe threats from Israel to its nuclear facilitiesandthe renewed imposition of tougher economic sanctions by the US. However, should it perceive the Development Road as a factor that would undermine its influence in Iraq and its interests in the region more generally, then there is a high chance that it would use its proxies scattered throughout the country to disrupt and delay the project’s progress. In this scenario, it will be important for both Iraq and Türkiye to find a diplomatic solution that prevents tensions from escalating into a full-blown conflict — whether in a political or military sense.
In addition to political and security aspects, the project faces financial risks as well. Currently, Qatar and the UAE are providing economic support to Iraq and Türkiye for the project. However, it remains unclear whether their funding will continue throughout all construction stages. This uncertainty around the commitment of international actors poses a significant threat, as it is doubtful that Iraq and Türkiye can bear the costs alone — especially withthe expenses projected to exceed the initial $17 billion estimate.
Iraq’s economic resources are strained, with much of its budget being used for security and welfare systems essential for maintaining stability. Additionally, its resources are unstable, asthey rely heavily on oil exports, which are highly susceptible to fluctuations in global demands. Likewise, Türkiye’s resources are under pressure as the country faceseconomic challenges caused by unorthodox policies. These conditions could undermine both countries’ commitment to the project. In this scenario, the two governments may have no choice but to look for other investors to keep thedreamof the Development Road feasible and alive.
Whether the Development Road will ever see the light of day is hard to say. As highlighted earlier, numerous challenges could hinder its realisation. However, if brought to life, the project will still need to prove its effectiveness and the advantages it promises — a task that will not be easy. The Development Road will, in fact, have to compete with other regional infrastructure projects aimed at strengthening trade routes connecting Europe to Asia via the Middle East — such as theIndia–Middle East–Europe Economic CorridorandChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. Backed by powerful stakeholders, these alternative initiatives could pose a major threat to the Development Road’s success by diverting attention and resources away from it. With so many players in the game, the competition for dominance is fierce.
Despite this, Iraq and Türkiye remain determined to continue gambling on the Development Road. While the stakes remain undeniably high, the potential rewards — ranging from economic growth to political stability — are even more enticing. In other words, the potentialjackpotis simply too tempting to resist. As Iraq and Türkiye place their bets on the Development Road, the question remains: will their risks pay off, or will they be overtaken by challenges and competition?
Only time will tell, but for now, the game is on.

The Democratic Republic of Congo’s fragile path to peace,"On the 30thof July, Angola announced a ceasefire agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Welcomed by the UNas a positive step towards de-escalation, the agreement is part of a longstanding context of violence and tensions that have plagued Eastern DRC for decades. Despite several peace agreements, peacekeeping missions, and international pressure, the situation deteriorated again in 2021 with the return of the March 23 (M23) armed group.
Over the years, the civilian population in the region has paid a high price. This conflict has led to the internal displacement of 7 million people and an estimated 6 million deaths in the DRC since 1996. Human rights violations, food insecurity, and epidemics are worsening an already direhumanitarian crisisthat only peace can start to solve.
The ceasefire agreement came as a fragile sign of improvement. However, the deteriorating humanitarian situation underscores the urgent need for sustainable peace.
The conflict’s roots trace back to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 when the then-Hutu-led government targeted Tutsis. As Paul Kagame – president of Rwanda since then – and his Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) won and took power, millions of Hutus – mainly civilians – crossed the border and fled to DRC in fear of retaliation. Some of these refugees were Hutu extremists and genocide perpetrators who started to formarmed groups, profiting from a lack of governance and pre-existing ethnic tensions linked to the refugees’ presence.
Kigali accused the Mobutu regime in DRC of complaisance with these groups. In 1996, backed by Tutsi militias based in Congo, Kagame’s military invaded East of the country to fight what Rwanda viewed as an imminent threat. With the support from Laurent Kabila, the opposition leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), and backing from other African countries—including Uganda, Angola, and Burundi—the Rwandan-led alliance forced Mobutu to flee and ultimately won the first Congo war in 1997.
The Second Congo War began in 1998 when Laurent Kabila, who succeeded Mobutu as head of state, sought to distance the Congolese government from Kigali and reduce its influence. As a symbolic move, he ordered all foreign troops to leave the country. In response, Rwanda invaded the DRC, supported by Uganda, Burundi, and other Tutsi-aligned forces. In 2001, an attempted coup led to the assassination of Laurent Kabila, after which his son, Joseph Kabila, assumed power.
The war was finally ended through the Global Inclusive Agreement of 2002, following four peace agreements: the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement (1999), the Sun City Agreement (April 2002), the Pretoria Agreement (July 2002), and the Luanda Agreement (September 2002).
Despite these agreements and the first Democratic elections in 2006, Eastern DRC has not achieved lasting peace.
A major aspect of the negotiations was the integration of former fighters into the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). However, a Rwanda-backed group, the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), resisted joining. The 2009 Goma Agreement incorporated the CNDP into the FARDC, but a faction later split off to form the M23 rebel group in 2012. After briefly occupying Goma, the M23 was driven out by UN forces and remained inactive until reemerging a decade later.
Successive peace processes tried to find lasting solutions to bring peace to Eastern Congo. Various tools and mechanisms were involved including the deployment of MONUSCO (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the establishment of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the 2013 “Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC, and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which, unfortunately, proved to be short-lived. While these initiatives brought temporary relief, they failed to eliminate the issues at the heart of the conflict.
The DRC is an immensely vast country, home to nearly 100 million people. The central government, based in Kinshasa, has struggled to establish effective governance across the entire territory. Lacking access to basic services and disconnected from the rest of the country, large segments of the population feel abandoned and have little faith in their government. In many regions, especially in Eastern DRC, this has created a political vacuum that armed groups exploit to recruit and terrorize local communities. This lack of governance is paired and reinforced by impunity for all the perpetrators of violence – military or militias, corruption, and local conflict dynamics.
Today, multiple actors contribute to the complexity ofthe DRC. In addition to the main armed groups backed by regional powers, the Islamic State-affiliated Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and smaller armed factions with varying allegiances are actively part of the violence in East DRC and contributing to peace failure. Neighbouring countries also play a key role in the destabilisation of the region. The Rwandan army‘scontinuous presence in DRC to fight the FDLR and its alleged support of the M23 movement are notorious. However, both Burundi and Uganda have also crossed the border to target groups that operate within their territories but hide in the DRC.
Additional foreign stakeholders have interests in East DRC. The DRC’s abundant mineral resources, essential for the energy transition, play a central role in the conflict. The nation holds 60% of the world’s coltan reserves, a critical component for electronics. Chinese andtheWestern mining companies and others have been operating in the region for decades. Reports show that various actors, including Rwanda, profit from illicit resource trafficking; The DRC government’s limited control over mining sectors allows the continuation of both violence and economic exploitation. As such, resource wealth is a motive and a mechanism for perpetuating conflict.
Addressing the UN Security Councilin early October, Mr. Huang Xia, UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes region, described the ongoing peace talks as “a glimmer of hope.”
In November 2021, the dormant M23 reappeared. Over the past three years, the movement has gained territory and weakened DRC’s army position in the region. Hosted under a new overarching organisation “the Alliance du Fleuve Congo (ACF)” the rebel group is accusing the government of not respecting the 2013 Nairobi agreement, to demobilise and reintegrate M23 soldiers. In February 2024, the armed groupsbombed the Goma airportdamaging military aircrafts and worrying the UN. Concerns grew with the impending departure of MONUSCO, as the government requested the UN peacekeeping mission to leave due to increasing controversy over its lack of effectiveness.
In response to this resurgence of the M23, new peace processes emerged.
The East African Community (EAC) launched the Nairobi Process in 2022, which engaged diverse stakeholders in dialogues to resolve internal conflict. The Process was seconded by a military volet but the lack of results in neutralising the M23 led to the withdrawal of the troops. It was replaced byThe Southern African Development Community Mission in the DRC –SAMIDRC. The Luanda peace process, under the Angolan President João Lourenҫo, aimed to reconcile DRC-Rwanda relations
Both processes are complementary, and after facing difficulties in 2023, they are being revitalized. The July Ceasefire agreement between Rwanda and DRC and the Rubavu agreement focused on neutralizing the FDLR and coordinating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces—suggest renewed commitment to cooperation.
Impediments to a lasting peace process persist. The DRC government refused the mediators’ suggestion to include the M23 in the peace talks. Rwanda continues to deny supporting the M23 despite theUnited Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) report. The situation remains fragile, and an expansion of the conflict in the region cannot be dismissed.
Newer peacebuilding approaches are now emerging, such as the recentHigh-Level Regional Forum of Women of the Great Lakes Region, held in Luanda, which underscores the potential of gender-inclusive efforts to foster reconciliation. Stakeholders are also exploring greater cooperation to reduce resource exploitation, which could limit funds fuelling the conflict and contribute to economic stabilization.
Writer’s Note:This article was written in November 2024. Since then, the situation has significantly deteriorated, with the M23 advancing and seizing key cities in eastern DRC. These developments have further dimmed hopes for a lasting peace, highlighting the persistent challenges in resolving the conflict.

(ARTICLE) EU – Israel Relations: Between Strong Ties and Strategic Ambiguity,"EU-Israel diplomatic ties were formally established in 1959 and, despite various political tensions, their relationship has been relatively stable. In particular, EU countries have developed bilateral relations with Israel fostering strong trade, energy security, and research cooperation. Still, the EU has consistently struggled to have a strong and coherent voice in foreign policy because of internal divisions among member states and differing priorities, which originated from the lack of a truly European approach regarding Israel and South Asia.
EU-Israel Economic Relations
Economic cooperation between the EU and Israel began withthe 1975 Free Trade Agreement, which established free trade for industrial and agricultural products. This agreement was later replaced by theEU-Israel Association Agreementin 1995, which entered into force in 2000. This agreement governs EU-Israel trade relations to this day. By 2022, the EU was Israel’smain trading partner, accounting for 28.8% of Israel’s trade in goods, amounting to €46.8 billion. The EU also supports Israel through variousfunding programs; notably they contribute €1.8 million annually to Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), which finances institutional twinning projects to align Israeli public administration with EU.In addition to trade, the EU and Israel collaborate extensively in research and innovation, fostering advancements through joint participation in Horizon Europe projects. Israel also participates in Erasmus+, enabling academic exchanges and strengthening “people-to-people” connections. Building on these strong trade and research ties, energy security and energy trade have become increasingly prominent areas of cooperation, particularly in light of global energy challenges.
In 2020 Israel became anet gas exporter, and although 64% of these exports have been committed to Egypt for 15 years, with the remainder going to Jordan, the presence of a new gas exporter near Europe was a welcome development. Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, the region’sstrategic importancehas significantly increased. The EU has described exports from Israel, Egypt, and Cyprus as strategic assets in its efforts to diversify the 27-nation bloc’s gas sources. In June 2022, Israel, Egypt, and the EU signed a  memorandum of understanding (MoU) toboost natural gas exportsto Europe, marking the first framework for substantial Israeli gas exports to the continent as Europe seeks alternatives to Russian energy.
EU-Israel Political Relations
The EU has consistently supported a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, as outlined in the1980 Venice Declarationand reaffirmed in theEU’s 2016 Global Strategy. Until 2005, the EU played anactive, if sometimes ineffective, rolein advocating for peaceful negotiations between Israel and Palestine. To advance the two-state solution, the EU employed various diplomatic, economic, and institutional instruments to foster dialogue and stability in the region. TheEuro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP), also known as the Barcelona Process, was launched in 1995 to enhance cooperation with 12 countries around the Mediterranean, seeking to promoteregional stabilitythrough economic and political cooperation at regional level.  The multilateral forum included Israel and Palestine as full participants opening new channels forpolitical dialogue, confidence-building, and practical cooperation among Israel, Palestine, and their Arab and European neighbours.
The EU’s enlargement in 2004 marked a historic political and economic shift, bringing the EU and Israel geographically closer. The EU and Israel signed theEU-Israel Action Planin 2005 under theEuropean Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), promoting the integration of Israel into European policies and programmes. The Action Plan, the validity of which is being further extended to January 2025, outlined four key priorities: enhancing political dialogue, boosting economic integration, strengthening cooperation in justice and policing, and expanding collaboration across various sectors such as environment, energy, transport, and technology.
However, since 2005, the EU has faced mountingchallengesin its declared efforts to sustain the Middle East peace process. First, the enlargement of the EU broadened its range of interests, making consensus increasingly challenging to achieve. Second, following the first military operation of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza in 2009, Operation Cast Lead, and later Operation Protective Edge in 2014, the European approach has grown increasinglyinconsistent. While Europe has criticised Israeli bombing campaigns and annexation policies, as well as the Palestinian Authority’s delegitimizing authoritarianism, this criticism has lacked concrete consequences. Third, tensions arose in November 2015 when the EU decidedto label settlement products, sparking criticism of the EU by the Israeli public and government. The decision was officialized to further protest with theEuropean Court of Justice’s 2019 ruling, which mandated that goods produced in Israeli settlements must be labelled to indicate their origin in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT).
EU-Israel economic relations continue to grow because EU member states haveprioritisedtheir bilateral ties with Israel over clearly promoting EU stances on the Israel-Palestine conflict.  While the EU continues to advocate for a two-state solution, conditions on the ground increasingly point toward aone-state reality.  In response, the EU employed contradictory strategies.  While supporting a two-state solution, the EU focused on strengthening relations with Israel.  Internal divisions even widened following Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.  While all EU member states acknowledged Israel’s right to self-defence, they disagreed on the limits of this right in light of the unprecedented death toll from Israeli military operations in Gaza. Thevote on 27 October at the UN General Assemblyregarding a resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, further showcased paralysis and deep divisions among EU member states. Three members of the Visegrád group – the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia – together with Croatia, votedagainstthe UN Resolution. Germany and Italy, major defense exporters to Israel, abstained from voting. Meanwhile, France, Spain, Ireland, and Belgium voted in favour of the resolution, adopting some of the most critical European positions regarding Israel’s actions during the Gaza war.
Recommendations
1. The EU needs to formulate a coherent external strategy toward the MENA region. Although the Middle East holds a significant place in the EU’s external policy – on issues such as immigration, terrorism, trafficking, and energy needs –bilateral relationscontinue to underpin most of its diplomatic efforts. Consequently, it is individual member states, rather than EU institutions, that largely determine the bloc’s policy in the region.
2. The EU needs to develop a common position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and speak with one voice on the topic. The endorsement of a two-state solution is an empty shell if it is not accompanied by coherent policies. Europe has moved from efforts to build a Palestinian state to attempts at managing an ever-worsening “status quo” to which it clings mainly because it sees no alternative. The EU is not only Israel’s main trading partner, but also the largest external donor to the Palestinians (€1.11-€1.356 billion from 2017 to 2020); however, economic support without meaningful political engagement cannot serve as an effective solution. Moreover, by not challenging the viability of a two-state solution, European leaders avoid confronting the consequences of their Israel policy, stopping short of holding Israel accountable for its erosion.
3. In the short term, the EU needs to leverage its strong economic position vis-a-vis Israel to influence its conduct. The EU unanimously imposedsanctionson Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank for the first time in April 2024, and again in July, citing human rights violations against Palestinians. Asuspensionof the EU-Israel Association Agreement – which provides for a human rights clause – could significantly impact Israel’s economy and help deliver a clearer message from the EU. Finally, Europe could alsoconditionits cooperation and trade with Israel on progress toward a two-state solution and the protection of Palestinian rights.
For Further Thought:
Will the MENA region play a more significant role in ensuring the EU’s energy security in the future?
Given the EU’s efforts to promote regional stability through initiatives like the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, can such initiatives still have an impact amid the current instability in the region, marked by the Israel-Gaza war, Israel’s rivalry with Iran and its allied militias, and the potential fallout from Bashar al-Assad’s ouster in Syria?
How would the EU’s enlargement to the Western Balkans and Ukraine impact its relations with Israel and the region?

(Analysis) Chips and Power: How TSMC Navigates Geopolitical Tensions,"Disclaimer: This article was written in January 2025, and therefore some information may be outdated, and events mentioned may have developed further.
Taiwan is one of the world’s top producers of semiconductors, manufacturing about 90% of the global supply of advanced computer chips. Its biggest manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), ranks as theninth-most valuable businessin the world. This “silicon shield” gives Taiwan significant leverage in navigating the complex geopolitical landscape between the U.S. and China. As tensions rise, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry finds itself at the heart of geopolitical pressure, with its pivotal role becoming a key factor in global security and technology.
In a 16th July 2024 interview withBloomberg Businessweek, then U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump voiced concerns about U.S.-Taiwan relations and Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. When asked if he would defend Taiwan against China if re-elected in November, Trump suggested that Taiwan should compensate the U.S. for its protection, stating that Taiwan was“stealing” American’s semiconductor jobs and that it was the U.S. that needed protection from Taiwan. Then onThe Joe Rogan Experience podcast, he again criticized the U.S. Chips Act and threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwanese chips if he became president.
This criticism isn’t new.Trumpfirst argued in 2023 that the U.S. should have imposed tariffs on Taiwan’s semiconductor exports. Trump’s comments triggered declines in TSMC’s share price on both occasions. More importantly, it raisedconcernsabout the future of U.S. – Taiwan relations and America’s role in the Asia-Pacific.
Semiconductors are at the heart of modern life, powering everything from home electronics to transportation, communications, clean energy systems, and AI technologies. Beyond commercial and daily applications, they hold immense strategic importance for national security.
Inmilitarycontexts semiconductors have long been essential for communication and, with advances in sensing and data processing, now play a crucial role in enhancing the computing power of modern defense systems. As semiconductor technology progresses, its impact on defense capabilities and strategies is set to be transformative, reshaping the future of military power and global security.Such significance makes the ability to produce semiconductors critically important.
Driven by strong growth and lower costs in emerging countries, a significant economic power shift fromWest to East. It is also the case for thesemiconductor industry. Historically, the sector was highly concentrated in the West. However, Western including the U.S., have limited government investment in semiconductors. The Department of Defense and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) have made only modest and specialized investments in specific technologies. In contrast, Asian governments have heavily invested in their semiconductor industries. There is no surprise that this crucial sector shifted to East Asia after briefly transitioning through Japan, then to Taiwan.
While much of the semiconductor value chain is concentrated in East Asia, it is far from monopolized by any single region. The semiconductor supply chain is highly complex and spans multiple continents, with different regions specializing in various stages of production. No one country dominates this industry. The supply chain can generally be divided into three main components: design, manufacturing (including wafer fabrication, assembly, and testing), and the equipment and materials necessary for production. Each region plays a distinct and specialized role. This fragmentation of expertise and specialization createsinterdependenceamong regions and makes each component irreplaceable
Overall, the global chip value chain, which includes design, manufacturing, and the relevant inputs, is still largely controlled by theU.S.and its allies, includingJapan,South Korea, and theNetherlands. However, China has adopted amilitary-civil fusion strategyto reduce its dependency on the global supply chain, focusing on self-sufficiency in semiconductor production.
Regardless of Trump’s remarks, the U.S. has actively sought to reduce its reliance on East Asia’s complex semiconductor supply chain. In 2022, the Biden administration passed the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing domestic semiconductor manufacturing and enhancing supply chain security. This bipartisan legislation marks a significant step in reshoring chip production and decreasing dependency on overseas suppliers.
Biden’s policies primarily target China’s advancements in chip development as part of a broader U.S. security strategy using“carrots” and “sticks”.Beyond merely blocking Chinese companies from obtaining advanced chips, the new restrictions bar the sale of SME and prohibit U.S. personnel from working for Chinese chip companies. Additionally, these policies aim to reshore semiconductor production by providing subsidies to incentivize companies to strengthen advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.
Taiwan’s semiconductor industry is crucial at the center of the U.S.-China geopolitical struggle. TSMC’s immense influence in the global supply chain acts as a strategic “silicon shield” for the island. However, U.S. restrictions on China present challenges for TSMC, given its significant business with Chinese customers and factories based in China. TSMC responds by halting the sale of advanced chips to Chinese-affiliated companies and personnel. At the same time, it has continuously invested in building new facilities and hiring American workers to staff them.
U.S. policy shows subtle signs of aiming to gradually decouple from TSMC leadership in the semiconductor industry. Concerns intensified when Trump accused TSMC and Taiwan of “stealing,” a choice of words that stirred debate and unease in Taiwan. His comments suggest a strategy of using TSMC as a bargaining chip in exchange for U.S. military protection, raising concerns about the future of U.S.-Taiwan relations, as he is now back at the White House. TSMC stock price experienced a suddendropafter the news of Trump winning the election.
Despite this pressure, TSMC’s unique position grants it substantial bargaining power. One key advantage is its ability to set prices, which serves as a vital bargaining tool in response to actions that may threaten its interests. A recent example is Intel’s loss of a 40% discount on TSMC’s latest chips after CEO Patrick Gelsinger’s remarks about Taiwan’s tenuous relations with China, which reportedlyoffendedTSMC. TSMC’s ability to adjust pricing terms, as illustrated by the recent case withIntel, underscores the strategic leverage it holds within the semiconductor industry. This flexibility in setting prices gives TSMC considerable influence over its client relationships—an advantage that proves valuable in the broader U.S.-China technology rivalry.
Even if TSMC faces tariffs or reduced subsidies, the intertwined nature of the global semiconductor value chain ensures its resilience. Tariffs would likely drive up the overall cost of chips, a burden that could ripple across industries and ultimately affect the U.S. This interconnected dependency explains why TSMC’s stock price recovers quickly, despite political shocks like Trump winning the election. Investors recognize the enduring demand for TSMC’s critical role in the supply chain. The future of TSMC is increasingly intertwined with Taiwan’s broader strategic considerations.
In response to global supply chain challenges and the U.S.’s demand. TSMC has been expanding its footprint beyond Taiwan. Alongside its factory in Arizona, the company is investing nearly $9 billion in a plant inJapanand establishing its first European site inDresden, Germany.
Meanwhile,emerging marketslikeIndia, thePhilippines,VietnamandSaudi Arabia, are vying for roles in the semiconductor ecosystem.India, for instance, launched an ambitious initiative in 2021. Offering substantial subsidies to attract investment and develop a domestic semiconductor industry. However, entry into the complex and capital-intensive semiconductor value chain poses significant challenges for these latecomers. The current global semiconductor network remains heavily dominated by the U.S., particularly in high-end design and technology.Geopolitical alignment limits the abilityof emerging players to acquire the advanced knowledge and technologies needed to climb the value chain. Although Chinese investment could offer an alternative, it risks entangling these countries in acomplex geopolitical landscapedominated by U.S.-China tensions, complicating their path to independence in this critical sector.
Whether under Biden or Trump, U.S. policy towards the Taiwan-China Strait shares a common thread of strategic caution. However, Trump’s inclination to frame alliances in transactional terms places Taiwan’s semiconductor sector squarely within his security calculus. Despite uncertainties surrounding a Trump presidency, manyexpertsremain confident in TSMC’s resilience.Its pricing power, coupled with unmatched expertise and technological capabilities. Ensuring its critical role within the global supply chain while adapting to geopolitical shifts.

Turning the Tide: South Asia’s Democratic Defiance in an Authoritarian Era,"Introduction
Over the past decade and a half, global politics has experienced significant and disruptive transformations. On a global level, although with different shades, political landscapes have been reshaped by the rise of populism and nationalism, coupled with the erosion of democratic institutions, the rise of illiberal ones, or the entrenchment of authoritarian regimes. This trend—often described as a wave of democratic backsliding—represents not just isolated developments but a coordinated shift that is altering the fabric of international relations and domestic governance alike. Scholars have documented a new form of democratic backsliding: Bermeo in “On democratic backsliding” (Journal of Democracy, vol. 27, no. 1, January 2016, pp. 5–19) where democracies do not collapse abruptly through military coups or revolutions, but rather erode incrementally, as elected leaders manipulate legal frameworks to extend their authority and restrict dissent. Levitsky and Ziblatt in “How Democracies Die”(2018), illustrate this phenomenon through detailed case studies, highlighting how democracies can deteriorate from within as leaders exploit legal mechanisms to curtail political freedoms, eliminate checks and balances, and consolidate power.
This trend is particularly evident in numerous countries where populist leaders have leveraged anti-elitist rhetoric, xenophobic tendencies, and nationalistic appeals to gain broad public support and implement policies that weaken democratic institutions mocked as ineffective or constrictive towards people’s will. Viktor Orbán’s Hungary offers a paradigmatic example of this form of “illiberal democracy.” Orbán has strategically consolidated power by curtailing judicial independence, restricting media freedoms, and weakening civil society, and now his party and cronies have entrenched themselves in power positions hard to challenge. His emphasis on “illiberalism” has become a blueprint for other leaders in Central and Eastern Europe, who view this model as an alternative to Western liberal democracy.
Similarly, in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has systematically reduced the independence of the judiciary, weakened opposition voices, and exerted control over the media, consolidating his hold on power and transforming Turkey’s political system into a more authoritarian structure, with a semblance of electoral democracy but aggressive agenda on foreign affairs coupled with a reaffirmation of Turkey’sIslamic roots. In Latin America, Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro rose to prominence through a blend of populist and nationalist rhetoric, which he wielded to polarize public opinion and cast the media and judiciary as opponents of the people’s will. His approach to governance, marked by an undermining of democratic norms and a rejection of international standards on human rights, resonated with similar movements around the globe.
Traditional democratization theory assumes that younger democracies are more susceptible to destabilization due to their comparatively weaker institutions and less established political norms. The older, consolidated democracies should theoretically possess a behavioral, attitudinal, and constitutional resilience that protects them from such regression. However, recent developments in democracies such as the United States and the United Kingdom challenge this assumption, demonstrating that even well-established democracies are vulnerable to authoritarian pressures, nationalism, and the erosion of democratic norms. In the United States, for instance, Levitsky and Ziblatt (2018) argue that the rise of populist rhetoric, particularly during the Trump administration, has undermined core democratic norms of mutual tolerance and institutional forbearance, casting the judiciary, media, and opposition parties as adversaries rather than democratic institutions. Similarly, the Brexit process in the United Kingdom showcased the susceptibility of even longstanding democratic institutions to populist mobilization and societal polarization. Scholars like Flinders (2018) argue that the “resilience paradox” in the UK’s institutions—where perceived stability fosters complacency—has left even this mature democracy exposed to destabilizing forces.
In 2024, South Asia appears to be rediscovering the power of democracy and popular participation. Authoritarian, nationalist, and populist tendencies are on the rise globally, and countries in this region are sending a strong signal of resistance and renewal. Through elections, civil uprisings, and even armed resistance, many South Asian populationsshowanunexpected attachment to democracy. This year, citizens and activists have challenged the growing authoritarian tendencies and indicated that even well-established leaders are subject to accountability showing interesting examples of democracy’s capacity for self-correction, adaptation, and responsiveness
India
In 2024, against all forecasts, after the general elections in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party lost the absolute majority in the parliament. Modi, whose decade-long tenure was marked by Hindu nationalist policies, consolidation of power, crony capitalism, and the systematic marginalization of religious minorities, had been widely expected to dominate the polls. His administration had leveraged control over media narratives, tightened its grip on state institutions, and faced repeated accusations of targeting journalists and political opposition. Despite these efforts, election results presented a significant setback for Modi’s BJP, which fell short of securing an even larger majority in parliament, BJP projected a target of over 400 seats, but it was able to secure only 240 out of 543—a dramatic decline from its previous standing. This outcome reflected an unanticipated discontent with Modi’s polarizing governance style. His Hindu nationalist and Hindu religious extremism failed to win the support of the people who were affected by economic challenges such as inflation, unemployment, and a struggling manufacturing sector. Regional parties and opposition coalitions, representing India’s diverse social fabric, capitalized on this discontent. The setback has forced Modi to shift his approach, as the BJP now relies on coalition partners to maintain power. This shift is likely to constrain Modi’s executive authority, compelling him to engage in a more collaborative, consensus-based style of governance—a stark contrast to the strongman image he has projected over the years. The election outcome not only tempers the BJP’s power butgiveshope to India’s secular and democratic identity. In this climate, Modi’s leadership may need to evolve from divisive tactics to building bridges, balancing his ambitions with the demands of a diverse electorate.
Ultimately, the 2024 election reaffirms the resilience of India’s democracy, where the electoral process serves as a powerful check on authoritarian drift. The challenge now lies in Modi’s willingness to adapt, as the country’s democratic institutions and its people call for a more balanced and inclusive political approach. This historic vote could symbolize a turning point in India’s backsliding tendencies, reinforcing the principles of democracy.

Thailand
Thailand’s political landscape wasrocked by the dissolution of the Move Forward Party (MFP), a popular progressive force that has consistently challenged Thailand’s conservative establishment. On August 7, 2024, the Constitutional Court disbanded MFP, citing its pledge to reform the country’s strict lese-majeste law, which criminalizes insults to the monarchy. The court’s ruling, rooted in a desire to “protect” the monarchy, reflects the power dynamics that have long kept Thailand’s political landscape under the influence of unelected bodies aligned with royalist and military interests. This dissolution follows the fate of the MFP’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, which was banned in 2020 on different charges, though similarly tied to its progressive and anti-establishment agenda.
The dissolution of MFP, which won the most votes in the 2023 elections, effectively invalidated the political voices of over 14 million Thais who supported the party’s campaign for a more transparent, democratic government. The party’s proposed reforms, which included breaking up monopolies, ending military conscription, and re-evaluating thelese-majeste law, resonated with Thailand’s youth and urban populations, including in traditionally conservative Bangkok. Despite this support, Thailand’s military-appointed Senate blocked MFP from forming a government, reinforcing the establishment’s resistance to any political entity threatening the status quo. Following the dissolution, MFP lawmakers announced the formation of the People’s Party, under which they plan to continue their reformist agenda to achieve a “decisive victory” in the next general election in 2027.
This shift is emblematic of Thailand’s “supra-constitutional” order, a term coined by Thai scholar Somchai Preechasilpakul to describe a system in which conservative and unelected institutions maintain ultimate control over Thailand’s political sphere, beyond the scope of electoral mandates. This structure has allowed royalist and military-aligned actors to dissolve multiple reformist parties since 2007, including those associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, illustrating the lengths to which Thailand’s conservative establishment will go to prevent democratic forces from gaining ground. Despite these obstacles, the Move Forward Party’s dissolution has not discouraged its leaders or supporters. Their strategic decision to regroup under the People’s Party aims to harness public frustration with the ruling elite, who many argue lack a clear vision for Thailand’s future beyond maintaining the status quo. The fate of the People’s Party will likely be shaped by its ability to galvanize this discontent, particularly in urban centers, and by the performance of the incumbent government, which has struggled to address pressing economic issues, further fueling calls for reform.
The dissolution has not only intensified domestic dissatisfaction but has also drawn international attention, with political analysts warning that these undemocratic measures could lead to increased political instability. MFP’s former leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, cautioned that this episode might spark renewed mass protests. Although Pita himself advocates for change through parliamentary channels, the pervasive sense of injustice among Thai citizens, particularly the youth, suggests that the conservative establishment’s approach could ultimately backfire, reinforcing rather than suppressing the democratic aspirations that MFP and now the People’s Party represent.

Bangladesh
The current political upheaval in Bangladesh has resulted in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation from office and flight from the country, ending her 15-year rule. Once hailed as a time of economic expansion and stability, Hasina’s administration came to be associated with authoritarian governance, marked by a deterioration of democratic norms, grave violations of human rights, and a stepped-up assault on dissent. She oversaw a string of dubious elections in Bangladesh that were tainted by allegations of manipulation, intimidation of opposition parties, and widespread media control, all of which served to silence anyone who tried to oppose her rule. Bangladesh was turning into an autocratic stronghold as civil rights were restricted and institutions that had previously supported democratic norms were methodically destroyed.
A period of political change is nowunderway in Bangladesh because of Hasina’s regime’s fall, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus leading an interim caretaker government that aims to reestablish democratic principles. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other political organizations, such as Jamaat-e-Islami, have been able to reenter the political sphere of Bangladesh due to the interim government’s restoration of competition. However, there are significant obstacles to this democratization endeavor, such as economic instability brought on by years of unfair economic policies and an excessive reliance on the textile industry, as well as sectarian tensions that have erupted in the absence of a strong-handed government. Bangladesh’s economy, which has suffered from slow GDP growth, a depreciating currency, and a substantial national debt linked to megaprojects that have not produced the anticipated returns, is being actively watched by economists. Addressing these issues while simultaneously fostering a stable political environment will be a key test for the interim administration.
The provisionalgovernment’s ability to rebuild Bangladesh’s democratic institutions will likely define the country’s political future. While Hasina’s regime stifled opposition and hollowed out democratic structures, there is a renewed public appetite for reform and accountability. Observers suggest that establishing a transparent electoral process will be crucial, as will the government’s approach to handling the military’s historic political influence. Long-standing institutions like the Rapid Action Battalion, implicated in numerous human rights abuses, may need significant restructuring or disbanding to facilitate democratic consolidation. The caretaker government’s success in promoting an inclusive and representative political environment will also depend on addressing inter-communal tensions and ensuring the protection of minority groups often marginalized under Hasina’s rule.
The path to a stable democracy remains fraught with challenges, yet the opportunity for a fresh start has generated optimism within Bangladesh and among its international allies. If managed effectively, this transition could place Bangladesh on a path to democratic resilience and economic recovery, reshaping its role in South Asia and beyond.

Myanmar
Myanmar’s civil war, now entering its fourth year, began as a direct response to the military junta’s abrupt halt to the nation’s transition towards democracy in 2021. Democratic supporters, faced with oppression and violence, fled to remote regions or rebel-held areas, forging alliances with marginalized ethnic groups and existing armed factions. Together, they have mounted a broad-based resistance to create a more inclusive and democratic Myanmar.
As opposition forces gain ground, the conflict has only intensified. The military junta recently attempted peace overtures, marking its first offer for dialogue since seizing power. Yet, these gestures have been broadly rejected by rebel groups and pro-democracy factions. The exiled National Unity Government, representing Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement, swiftly dismissed the proposal, questioning the junta’s legitimacy in overseeing elections or offering any genuine resolution to the country’s political crisis. Major ethnic armed groups have also rebuffed the overture, demanding the military’s withdrawal from politics, accountability for extensive human rights abuses, and the establishment of a federal democratic constitution—demands the junta is highly unlikely to accept.
The ongoing military strategies and the junta’s failure to negotiate sustainable peace reveal the deep-seated divides within Myanmar. The country is now more fragmented than ever, with the junta retaining control over less than half of Myanmar’s territory. The widespread disillusionment with the regime has fueled both internal resistance and international denunciation, with the United Nations labeling Myanmar as descending into an “abyss of human suffering.” Tens of thousands have been killed, millions displaced, and the nation’s infrastructure and social fabric are steadily eroding. Cross-border crime is escalating, and the deteriorating humanitarian and economic situation shows little sign of abating.
This conflict has become an all-out struggle for democracy against the junta’s dictatorship. As the regime clings to power, the opposition remains resolute, signaling that the fight for Myanmar’s future is far from over and is likely to usher in further turmoil as the crisis deepens.
Conclusion
In 2024, South Asia appears to be rediscovering the power of democracy and popular participation. At a time when centralized authority and authoritarian tendencies are on the rise globally, countries in this region are sending a strong signal of resistance and renewal. In a world of growing democratic backsliding tendencies, South Asia provides a glimpse of hope and reflection, demonstrating how the struggle for democracy can still resonate powerfully.

Joy by name not by life – Portrait from the South,"What I’m going to tell you is not easy. And it is not only my story. It is the story of many women in Lebanon—women who lack access to education, who live under patriarchy, and who are forced to follow norms imposed by society.
Joy’s Journey: From Survival to Resilience Amid Lebanon’s Tumultuous Landscape
At 34, Joy, a mother of five, has lived through more adversity than many could fathom. Born and raised in the heart of Southern Lebanon, Aytaroun, and then Toura, she grew up in a place wherewar was an echoing backdropand hardship was woven into the daily fabric of life. Recently, war has forced her to leave her village and find refuge in the mountains of Mayrouba, away from the home she had fought to make peaceful. Her story sheds light not only on the struggles women face in Lebanon but also on the resilience that defines them and theongoing war.
A Challenging Childhood
Joy’s life began in poverty, amid family strife. Her father was often angry, while her mother bore the weight of both parental roles. “I don’t remember ever buying clothes or having the freedom of a child,” she recalls. “Our survival sometimes meant cultivating things we’d rather not, just to put food on the table.” By the age of 11, she had started bearing adult responsibilities—cooking, caring for her siblings, and holding together a household that often seemed on the verge of breaking. Her father’s imprisonment was both a relief and a burden, bringing both peace and added responsibility. By the time he returned, Joy was a teenager, and her brief childhood moments were already behind her.
Marriage and the Role of a Woman
In her late teens, Joy was married off to a man 20 years older than her,  mainly to escape the turbulence at home. “My mother thought marriage would bring me peace,” she says. Yet this new chapter came with its challenges. Her critical and controlling in-laws monitored her every move, and Joy spent many nights in prayer, feeling as if freedom and peace were just out of reach.
Over time, Joy grew into her marriage and eventually started to love her husband. “He was the opposite of my father; he treated me with kindness and respect.” As the years passed, she found the strength and determination to offer her children the life she never had. “My daughters will have the chance to study, to experience life. I want them to feel love, joy, and freedom.”
“My community, however, was and still is slow to evolve”. When Joy’s eldest daughter turned sixteen, a man twice her age asked for her hand. Joy allowed her daughter the freedom to choose, reinforcing her right to live and love freely, while still guiding her within the bounds of their culture. For Joy, respect and responsibility must come first in love, a message she imparts to her daughters. “But sadly this is not the case for all the girls in our community. Coming from poor areas in the South, lots of girls get married at 15-16. Freedom to choose is rarely an option.”
Faith and Resilience in a divided society
“They taught us religion wrong. They taught us interdictions: don’t show skin, don’t answer when a man talks, don’t listen to music it is haram… I loved God of fear. I used to pray because I was afraid of getting hit by my father, afraid of the violence. And then people would say “Don’t do this or that because God will get mad”.
Joy’s relationship with faith has been a journey from fear to love. Taught as a child to fear God and to obey rules without question, she grew up praying out of fear of punishment. Only in adulthood, through self-reflection and reading, she started to understand faith as rooted in compassion and forgiveness. “God is love and understanding, not punishment. We are human, allowed to make mistakes,” she says, emphasizing that ignorance, not religion, is what fuels judgment within her community.
Lebanon’s society remains deeply dividedalong religious and sectarian lines. Yet for Joy, true faith and community transcend these boundaries. “The war showed me there is no Sunni, Shia, or Christian—only humanity. We are all just people trying to live and survive,” she says.
War and Displacement
Just before the recent escalation of conflict, Joy’s husband returned from Africa, and her family cherished the peace of his presence. They spent time at the beach, prepared for the children’s return to school in October, and dreamed of an easier future. Then came the rockets, the evacuations, and the frantic journey north.“The drive to Mayrouba was harrowing; it took us nine hours. Every fifteen minutes,the car’s wheels would slide. We saw families stranded, people crying, everyone trying to escape. Everything happened so fast. I remember it was a Monday, my husband had left the day before. I was at the market, an hour away from our village. People were murmuring, everyone seemed anxious. I asked what was going on, and they told me Israel had started striking. Then, I got a call from my eldest telling me they had just hit near our house. I dropped everything and rushed back home. The road going north was empty, but the opposite side was packed with cars trying to flee.”
“It felt like a scene from a movie. Black smoke rose on both sides from the fires, firefighters dashed around, and aid workers did all they could. My five children were at home. I can’t put into words what I felt driving back. May God never test us like that again. The sounds of missiles overhead were even worse than their explosions. My children were terrified. I just wanted to keep them safe, so I took them to my sister’s. We spent the whole day in one room without eating. I just wanted to go home, to sleep in my bed. Now I understand when they say a captain never leaves his ship, even as it sinks. That’s how we felt, and we still feel that way.As soon as I opened our front door, a rocket fell just behind the house. Rubble, dust, stones, glass—everything shattered. There are no words to describe what we felt. We stayed only to pack, spent one last night, and at seven the next morning, my brother-in-law came to get us to a safer place. On our way to Mayrouba, we passed through Beirut. It broke my heart to see families on the streets—families who once had homes, land, and lives. It felt like the whole world had turned upside down.”
Arriving in Mayrouba brought some relief, but no real solution.“We were 31 people, crammed into a tiny apartment, sharing everything. The nightmare continued.” Despite moments of laughter and camaraderie, the overcrowded living conditions wore everyone down. The children grew restless, the adults grew tense, and arguments broke out daily. “The war outside seemed to take root inside, between each of us and within each of us.”Determined to restore a sense of normalcy, Joy eventually found a small apartment for her immediate family, reclaiming a measure of stability and dignity.
Reflections on Lebanon’s Political and Social Landscape
Joy holds complex feelings about the political landscape that has shaped her life. Growing up in southern Lebanon, the influence of the Hezbollah party was woven into her education. She once felt admiration for its former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, though she was never affiliated with the party.“He gave significance to the Shia community, calling us the ‘most honorable of people’ (ya achraf el nass), bringing us together. But now, so much has changed. We are broken, shattered. We have all lost something: a home, a loved one, a village. No child should have to die for a cause. The blood that has been spilled—and continues to be spilled—is unjust. Yet, sadly, in my community, some still believe otherwise. How can people be so blind? How can they accept this kind of death? Are we all human?”
Lebanon’s fractured communities continue to bear the weight of war and economic hardship, but Joy believes that education is the key to breaking cycles of ignorance and judgment. She hopes that her daughters will grow up empowered, free from the constraints of societal expectations, and capable of making their own choices.
Looking Ahead: A Message of Strength
As she navigates the uncertainty of displacement, Joy clings to hope like a lifeline. She dreams of returning to her beloved homeland, of seeing her children flourish, unshackled by the constraints that once bound her. Her message to women facing similar struggles is both a call and a challenge: “Be strong. Live your life on your own terms. Don’t say ‘yes’ to everything, or you’ll be crushed. Hold your ground.”
Joy’s life is a testament to the resilience of Lebanese women—the quiet, fierce strength of those who carry on despite being uprooted and displaced. Her story reveals the soul of Lebanon’s southern communities, communities bound by struggle but sustained by hope. Against the backdrop of war and displacement, her spirit endures, bearing witness to a truth that can’t be taken: even in the darkest times, the will to survive and to dream is unbreakable.","November 30, 2024",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/human-stories/joy-by-name-not-by-life-portrait-from-the-south/,Aïda Abou Charaf,thenewglobalorder.com,Human Stories
Down to the Rubbish: How Media Built Brazil’s Celebrity Judges,"For over a decade, trials involving political elites have propelled Brazilian judicial figures into the public eye, with several acquiring celebrity status. This shift is remarkably illustrated by the careers of Joaquim Barbosa, Sergio Moro, and Alexandre de Moraes—three magistrates whose prominence has extended beyond ‘cold law’ into the realm of politics. Each appeals to different segments of society: Moro became a celebrated figure among right-wing groups while alienating much of the left; Moraes has found support among Bolsonaro’s critics while facing fierce opposition from his allies; and Barbosa, who initially clashed with the left during the ‘Mensalão’ trials, later gained some of their favour as a critic of Bolsonaro. Together, these cases show how judicial celebrity has cut across ideological lines, with courts increasingly constituting a backyard of politics in Brazil.
— President, how do you see…— I don’t see anything. Leave me alone, boy. Leave me alone! Get down to the rubbish like you alwaysdo.
Exchange between a journalist and the then president of Brazil’s Supreme Court (STF), Joaquim Barbosa. March 2013.
Within the Supreme Federal Court (STF)—often perceived as a secluded institution—Justice Joaquim Barbosabecame a household nameduring his handling of the ‘Mensalão’ trials (2005–2012). ‘Mensalão’ was amajor corruption scandalinvolving alleged payments to congresspeople for support under then-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. It led to the conviction of several high-ranking members of the ruling Workers’ Party (PT), many of whom laterhad their sentences reduced or overturned.
‘Mensalão’resonated deeply with a sentiment pervasive across Brazilian society, namely,distrust in political institutions. Sectors of the media and society alike made Barbosa a hero—amythosbuilt not on rulings alone but also his bold, often confrontational demeanour; he wasfamously critical of other justices, whom he denounced as sympathetic toward the elites. His no-nonsense engagement with the press was marked by headline-prone statements, such as ‘those who thought the Supreme Court would have a submissive, subservient black man were mistaken.’ Mountingly, the ‘Mensalão’ trials acquired the guise of a moral battle rather than a mere legal affair.
In the lead-up to 2013’scarnaval, a mask factory in São Gonçalo (Rio de Janeiro)announced it would issue 120 masks depicting Barbosa—a modest amount to gauge consumer response. A week before the festivities, however, the manufacturerhad sold 25,000 of the propswith a further 15,000 underway.
Many eyes eventually turned to Barbosa, now a celebrity, as a potential leader beyond the Supreme Court.When asked whether he planned to run for an elected office, he denied. ‘I have no interest,’ the justice told the press. ‘I have nophisique du rôle.’ And yet, the opening was there: upon his retirement from the STF, Brazil’s Socialist Party (PSB) urged him to run as their candidate for the 2018 presidential election. Though Barbosaultimately declined the offer, he did not do so right away. Several surveys were conducted in the meantime, with the polls coming thereofprojecting strong support for his candidacy.​
Judge Sergio Moro rose to fame through his role in ‘Lava Jato’(2014-2018), arguably Brazil’s biggest anti-corruption operation to date. Starting as a money laundering investigation into Brazil’s state-owned oil utility, Petrobras, ‘Lava Jato’ went on to uncover a network of high-ranking politicians, business leaders, and construction firms that exchanged government contracts for bribes. As the judge presiding over the case, Moro oversaw the condemnation of multiple high-ranking officials, includingthe chief-of-staff in Lula’s first administration(2003-2006), andthe deputy speaker of the lower house of Congress. These rulings had Moro regularly under spotlights, but none had a greater impact than hissentencing of ex-president Lula to nearly 10 years in jail.
The magistrate would become one of the most polarising figures in Brazil’s recent times. While critics, throughout the operation, accused him of politically motivated decision-making, supporters saw a national hero. They wouldpour into the streetswearing masks and t-shirts bearing Moro’s semblance, and even a39-foot ‘Superman’ statuewas raised in his honour. ‘MORO FOR PRESIDENT’ soonturned into a common motif. When interrogated by the ‘Lava Jato’ judge, Lula famouslyremarked that Moro was ‘condemned to condemn’ him, since much of the public already had.
Like Barbosa before him, Morovehemently deniedhe would ever run for office: “No, never. Never. I’m a man of justice and, without any demur, I’m not a man of politics.” Elaborating on his reasons, he explained: “It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to run for any kind of political office because that could, let’s put it this way, call into question the integrity of the work I’ve done so far.”
Nonetheless, a few weeks after sentencing Lula to jail, Moro announced he would quit ‘Lava Jato’to join the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro—Lula’s main political adversary—as Minister of Justice and Public Security. Whilst performing this role, he again denied that he would ever run for office. In 2022, Morowas elected senator with 1.9 million votes.
Justice Alexandre de Moraespresided over the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE)during the 2022 elections,the closest in Brazil’s history. Known by the nickname ‘Xandão,’ he became known for hard-line decisions, such asbarring Bolsonaro from political office until 2030andauthorising the blocking of social media accountsaccused of election-related misinformation. Following theJanuary 8th riots at the Three Powers Plaza, in which pro-Bolsonaro protestors contested the election results, Moraesoversaw the prosecution of over 200 individuals, issuing sentences of up to 17 years. While his stringency has earned him supporters whoview him as a protector of democracy, detractors havelabeled him a ‘dictator,’ claiming his actions overreach. Notwithstanding different sentiments around him, Moraes’ decisions have been closely scrutinised across the political spectrum.
The justice was recently launched to worldwide notoriety amid a feud with billionaire Elon Musk. When Musk’s social media platform X (formerly Twitter) announced its plans to cease operations in Brazil, Moraes mandated the appointment of a local legal representative to ensure compliance with Brazilian law. Musk’s non-responsiveness resulted in the STFordering the suspension of X in the country. In a sharp rebuttal, Muskcalled Moraes an ‘unelected pseudo-judge.‘ He commenced a series of posts in ridicule of the magistrate, some of whichcompared him to pop culture villainsDarth Vader (‘Star Wars’) and Lord Voldemort (‘Harry Potter’).
There has been some speculation on whether Moraes could eventually transition to politics.Hiscareer before the STF included several political roles, such as São Paulo State Secretary of Public Security (2002, 2015–2016) and Minister of Justice and Public Security (2016–2017). Behind his ambivalent persona, which combines the sternness of a law enforcer with a jokester, a ‘meme-worthy’ approach to criticism, Moraes may yet seize the silver lining in his divisiveness.
The cases of Barbosa, Moraes, and now-senator Moro reflect a broader trend. Whilst the judicial branch’s attributions and powers were specifically outlined to limit political interference, its role in mediating high-profile controversies has put magistrates under a level of spotlight hitherto unseen. This has brought a new set of challenges to their function, particularly regarding the duty of impartiality (grounding rulings on law over personal predilections).
It may be a stretch to affirm that fame and neutrality can categorically not coexist—but the former veritably constitutes an obstacle to the latter. As Carl Schmitt once wrote, ‘The political is the most intense and extreme antagonism.’ Judges presiding over high-profile cases are not external observers: they too have stakes in the game. Political ramifications deriving from their rulings interweave with their own reputations, especially amid polarisation. In such circumstances, it is no easy job to discern where a judge ends and a ‘public figure’ begins.
Wide access to informationhas been key to promoting democratic participation, but it has also brought new challenges to the separation of powers. If, on the one hand, the judicial branch is reliant upon trust for legitimacy and public compliance, a rise in ‘celebrity judges’ endangers the very condition of this trust, namely, the presumption of impartiality. Media scrutiny puts the judiciary on a delicate spot—particularly in Brazil, a nation notoriously distrustful of its political institutions.
Faced with these challenges, specialists have proposed several avenues to mitigate the politicisation of judges in Brazil. These include:

Brazil and Mexico eye new trade relationship amid friendshoring pressures and an uncertain Mercosur,"As the new Mexican president, AMLO-successor Claudia Sheinbaum, took office on 1 October 2024, a litany ofLatin American leadersmade themselves present. Among them was Brazil’s Lula, who traveled to Mexico accompanied by a wide delegation of policymakers andinfluential figuresfrom his government, including his Foreign Affairs Minister, Mauro Vieira, and soon-to-be Central Bank Chairman, Gabriel Galípolo.  While media coverage largely focused ontechnical issueswith Lula’s presidential plane, the Brazilian leader used the trip to engage in significant trade discussions and participate in theBrazil-Mexico Business Forum.
While both Lula and Sheinbaum predecessor Andrés Manuel López Obrador could be described as being of a similar political background, Mexican trade with Brazil operated under limited agreements, which covered asmall set of products. The expansion of trade with Mexico has been sought by the Brazilian business class for a long time, and recent AMLO policies covering the reduction of import fees on certain commodities has allowed Brazilian agribusiness an entry into the Mexican market. This growing trade cooperation has been described as awin-win scenario, since it allowed for a reduction of inflation in Mexico and strengthened Brazilian exports.
Furthermore, the Mexican market provides a valuable shift in dynamics for Brazilian trade. Normally dominated by the export of commodities to the United States, Europe and Asia, Brazilian trade encounters in Mexico a rare market forits manufactured products. From Mexico’s point of view, negotiating with Brazil can offer a useful alternative to trade with the United States. Despite the recent surge in trade with the Americans, which in the last years made Mexico theno.1 commercial partnerto the U.S., expanding trade agreements with Brazil can offer Mexico a way to reduce pressures from its now largest trade partner: by showing it can effectively deal with Brasilia, Mexico City can possibly avoid a message of overreliance on U.S. trade.
Against this potential trade development between Brasilia and Mexico City stands the background of radical reorganization of trade trends in Latin America. Formerly the region’s promising trade bloc, the Mercosur has been recently undermined by leaders who at times seemed more interested in bilateral negotiations and individual orientation. With Brazil’sJair Bolsonarobefore and Argentina’sJavier Mileinow, a faltering Mercosur does not seem to inspire confidence in its project as it did once before, despite the recent ingress of Bolivia and themassive trade deal signed with the European Union. The expectation of returning isolationist governments in the region casts a shadow over Mercosur’s long term reliability.
As Mercosur can be undermined by its own member states, stakeholders in the region and in Latin America as a whole may feel like their best option lies in bilateral agreements and direct trade negotiations with other partners. Large geopolitical macro movements can also cast a long shadow over the region. Amid renewed rounds of sanctions andfriendshoringpressures, U.S. and Western trade as a whole have been wary of China. The proposition ofdecouplingfrom Chinacan offer lucrative spaces in supply chains for many stakeholders in Asia and abroad, and characterizes itself as perhaps the most relevant trade development of the post-globalization period.
In this context, companies are scrambling to reorganize their supply chains due to sanctions and pressures for Washington. As a result, several countries have emerged as trade winners. Vietnam and India, for example, have been the newfound home of many high-profile U.S. companies, includingApple. Mexico, as aforementioned, has been championed as thereceptor of many of these returning production chains.
While the effectiveness and success of these developments arestill uncertain, this vector pulls Mexico towards the north, towards trade with the United States. Thefriendshoringtrend could certainly benefit other stakeholders in Latin America, but it has not been the case so far, as many of the exiting production chains from China are linked to manufactured products. As the Mexico trade is pulled towards the north and towards Washington, engaging deeply in trade with Brazil and other southern partners can perhaps play a strategy of Mexico’s ownfriendshoringand trade security, spacing its bets and decreasing risks of overreliance on one partner.
All of these high-profile global trade trends which impact Latin America can also be heavily influenced by the upcoming second Trump administration. After its confirmed victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, Trump brings its own stamp of brass and unpredictable influence over trade. Even though the Democratic platform of containing China over the past few years under the scope ofBidenomicshas continued many of Trump’s initial propositions, the Republican can possibly enhance and intensify strategies of pressuring China and other trade partners.
Offering a strategy mix of isolationist, tariff-oriented, and self-serving trade views, Trump’s platform might accelerate thedecouplingstrategy and seek the promotion of other trade partners. Under this new and unpredictable scenario, Brazil and Mexico might do well in seeking a derisking and more stable strategy of common trade.
In conclusion, asfriendshoringoffers Mexico a privileged trade position with the U.S. and as Mercosur falters under the often uninterested position of its own member states, trade trends in Latin America are going through a difficult and unstable period. Larger global trends cast a long shadow over the continent and the latest conversation on traderapprochementbetween its two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico, can hopefully provide an autochthonous impulse to trade in the region.
Questions
1 – Should Mexico seek other trade partners in an effort to derisk its overreliance with trade with the U.S.?
2 – Could the Mexican market complement Brazil’s industrial sector and offer a lucrative space for the export of Brazilian manufactures?
3 – How will a second Trump administration impact trade in Latin America?

Diplomacy at the State Level: How California’s Governor Gavin Newsom Shapes Foreign Policy,"In recent years, U.S. governors have become more than actors of state policy. They’ve emerged as influential diplomats, shaping the contours of foreign policy in unexpected ways. At the forefront of this shift is California’s Governor, Gavin Newsom, who has harnessed California’s economic clout to expand its influence on the global stage. With strategies that include high-profile trade missions, international partnerships, and agreements addressing global issues, Newsom has exemplified how state governments can make meaningful contributions to foreign policy, often independently of, or even at times in contrast to, federal government actions.
California, thefifth-largesteconomy in the world, holds an economic andculturalsway that makes it a formidable player in global affairs. Newsom recognizes this power, positioning himself not only as a governor but as an ambassador for Californian values and interests, from trade relations toclimate laws. In a world where federal foreign policy can often seem inward-focused or volatile, Newsom’s approach is a striking example of state-led economic diplomacy. His actions raise intriguing questions: to what extent can a state like California shape international relations? And how do Newsom’s efforts compare to those of other governors trying to drive economic diplomacy?
Newsom has made a series of bold moves that underscore California’s willingness to forge its path in global diplomacy. His recentdiplomatic mission to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping, was emblematic of California’s proactive stance. Officially, the visit was intended to address climate change—a shared interest between California and China. But its subtext was impossible to miss: California is open for business, and it’s willing to engage directly with foreign powers to attract investment and expand trade. Newsom’s meeting with Xi Jinping, a rare opportunity for a U.S. governor, highlights his ability to secure California’s voice in international dialogues that are traditionally reserved for federal representatives. Importantly doing so, without the “antagonistic framing of bilateral relations” that is the norm in Washington.
California has long led in sectors that define global innovation—technology, entertainment, and environmental sustainability. Newsom’s diplomatic strategy taps into these strengths. By building relationships with countries interested in green technology and digital advancements, he aligns California’s economic future with its values. His administration has signed agreements with several nations, including Japan and various European countries, focused on clean energy initiatives. These partnerships are not just symbolic—they’re tied to tangible investments and technology exchanges that benefit California’s economy.
Newsom’s approachto economic diplomacy is not confined to his high-profile China visit. He has also led trade delegations to nations likeJapanandMexico, where California has strong business interests. These missions are of course carefully designed to appeal to foreign investors by showcasing California’s unique blend of innovation, environmental consciousness, and market access. For instance, during hisvisit to Japanas Mayor of San Francisco, Newsom emphasized California’s leadership in technology and green energy, sectors where Japanese investors have shown keen interest. These trade missions as well as appearances at conferences, such as theWorld Economic Forumoffered Newsom an opportunity to emphasize California’s openness and resilience, especially important at a time when the U.S. federal government’s foreign policy can appear inconsistent. They represent a walk on a diplomatic tight rope, between brokering agreements that could cement California’s progressive goals, while engaging with regimes that do not share the same beliefs in human rights and Newsom’s progressive agenda.
Trade missionsare hardly new, but Newsom has elevated their purpose. In addition to attracting investment, he uses these trips to advocate for shared policy interests—climate action, green tech, and social equity—that resonate internationally. By highlighting these values, Newsom appeals to international leaders and business communities who share these priorities, creating anetwork of stakeholdersthat view California as a reliable, progressive partner on the global stage.
While Newsom’s approach is perhaps the most visible, other U.S. governors are engaging in their own forms of economic diplomacy. Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer, for example, has focused ontrade relationshipswith Canada, particularly in theautomotive sector, which is central to Michigan’s economy. Similarly, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp hasstrengthened tieswith Germany and Poland, both key partner in Georgia’s growingmanufacturingand logistics sectors. Each of these governors leverages their state’s economic strengths, but the methods and areas of emphasis reveal subtle differences.
Michigan’s focus is pragmatic, centering onexistingeconomic interdependencies. Georgia, on the other hand, has adopted a strategy similar to California’s byattemptingto position itself as an attractive location for European manufacturing and logistics. But where Georgia’s diplomacy is largely transactional, Newsom’s has a narrative. He promotes California as asymbolof progressive governance, positioning its values as not only relevant but essential in today’s global economy. This branding element is a distinguishing feature of Newsom’s economic diplomacy—it’s as much about values as it is about business.
Newsom’s economic diplomacy isn’t just aboutpromotingCalifornia; it also has broader implications for U.S. foreign policy. His initiatives provide a counterpoint to federal foreign policy, which under recent administrations has at times not only leanedisolationist, but reinforced thezero-sum pressuresin the global system. In reaching out to China, Japan, and other countries, Newsom offers a vision of American leadership that is engaged, collaborative, and grounded in shared values. His actions send a message that while federal policy may ebb and flow, states like California are committed to building lasting international partnerships.
The environmental agreements Newsom has spearheaded are particularly significant. They reinforce California’s commitment to addressing climate change, an area where the state has set aggressive goals, often ahead of federal mandates. By formingpartnershipswith countries that share these environmental priorities, Newsom positions California as a global leader in climate action. This role can have ripple effects, as international leaders and companies may view California’s policies as amodel, which shows that energy transformation and sustainable policy go hand in hand withjob creation, ultimately pressuring the federal government to adopt similar standards.
Newsom’s approach suggests that the future of U.S. economic diplomacy may increasingly involve subnational actors. Governors, particularly those of economically powerful states, arewell-positionedto act as intermediaries in areas where federal policies may be constrained by partisanship or geopolitical complexities. With California leading the way, it’s conceivable that other states will adopt similar strategies, recognizing that global engagement can be as beneficial locally as it is nationally.
As governors like Newsom continue to assert their presence on the world stage, questions arise about the role of state governments in shaping international relations. Are these efforts an enhancement of U.S. foreign policy or a challenge to the traditional hierarchy? Newsom’s case shows that the answer is likely both. His actions reflect the growing influence of states in global affairs and demonstrate how economic diplomacy can serve as a bridge between state interests and global needs.
In the coming years, we may see more governors following Newsom’s lead, stepping into diplomatic roles that emphasize their state’s economic priorities and values. Whether through climate partnerships, trade delegations, or investment attraction, these leaders are redefining the limits of state power in foreign policy. And in doing so, they’re creating a new model for how American values and economic interests are projected onto the global stage, one state at a time.
What are possible long-term impacts of state-led diplomacy on U.S. international relations?
Could state-led climate diplomacy push the federal government toward more aggressive environmental policies?
How do state-led foreign policy initiatives reflect or deepen political divides between state and federal leadership?

Who Votes in Brazil? Social and Economic Determinants of Participation,"In Brazil,voting is mandatoryfor most of the adult population, being optional only for young people aged 16 to 17, people over 70, and illiterate individuals. Even so, between 2014 and 2024, the abstention rate in elections showed a growth trend, reaching 29.26% in the second round of the 2024 elections, according to data from theSuperior Electoral Court (TSE). This was the highest abstention rate since the 2000 elections. In the first round of the 2024 elections, about 33.8 million Brazilians did not vote, representing 21.71% of the total eligible voters. Given this scenario, in apress conference, the president of the TSE, Minister Cármen Lúcia, stated that abstention should be studied so that there is a reduction in the next elections.
Voting is one of the pillars of any democracy. Even the most simplistic democratic theories, such as those defended by Schumpeter, recognize the importance of voting as an instrument for citizens to participate in choosing their representatives and defining the political direction of a society. Thus, voting is seen by many not only as a right but also as an essential civic duty for the legitimacy of democratic institutions and the maintenance of political order. Without popular participation—often exercised solely through voting—power may cease to reflect the collective will, losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the governed. Brazil, with its long tradition of compulsory voting, stands out for having a participation rate that, at first glance, would seem guaranteed by legal requirements. However,datacollected over recent electoral cycles show the reality is much more complex. Even with compulsory voting, various social, economic, and institutional factors contribute to abstention, raising questions about the effectiveness of the mandatory voting system and how certain social groups are excluded from this process.
To better understand these factors, we conducted a statistical analysis usingdata from the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), complemented bydata from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), which included a linear regression to identify the most influential variables affecting voter turnout rates. This analysis allowed us to observe patterns and highlight the characteristics contributing to voter participation or abstention.
The data show that age group is one of the main determinants of participation. Young people aged 16 to 18, who have optional voting, surprisingly show a turnout rate higher than that of older age groups who are required to vote. This may reflect an initial sense of civic responsibility and a greater interest in change. However, this behavior does not hold up over the years. The participation rate drops drastically after the age of 25, with indications that disillusionment with politics and lack of representation among candidates contribute to the disengagement of young adults. Meanwhile, those over 70, also exempt from voting, seem to have the highest tendency toward abstention.
Another relevant factor is related to the marital status of voters. Married or widowed people tend to participate more than single or divorced individuals, suggesting that family structure may significantly influence the decision to vote. This difference may be attributed to the support of spouses and family members who often create an atmosphere of encouragement and collective responsibility. Among voters who live alone, the phenomenon of diffusion of responsibility may come into play, leading to the feeling that their participation will have little impact on the outcome.
Education level proves to be an essential factor in explaining abstention rates. Voters with lower education levels are more likely to abstain, partly reflecting a lack of access to quality information about the electoral process, candidates, and proposals. Additionally, practical barriers, such as difficulty accessing transportation to polling places and lack of flexibility at work, hinder participation. On the other hand, voters with high school and higher education are more likely to vote, possibly due to broader access to information and a better understanding of the political impact of their vote.
Significant differences were also observed in participation based on urban hierarchy. Voters in local and sub-regional centers demonstrated higher engagement than those in large metropolitan areas. This result suggests that, in smaller cities, there is a greater sense of connection with the candidates, and the effects of local policies are perceived more directly. In contrast, in large cities, social fragmentation and symbolic detachment from representatives seem to discourage participation.
GDP per capita also proved to be an important variable in analyzing voter turnout. The wealthier regions of Brazil tend to have lower abstention rates, which can be explained by better economic conditions that allow greater access to information about the electoral process and reduce logistical barriers, such as transportation to polling stations. Conversely, economically disadvantaged regions face challenges that hinder participation, including inadequate infrastructure and less access to public policies that promote citizen inclusion.
These analyses point to an urgent need to devise strategies that not only ensure access to the electoral process but also promote greater engagement, especially among historically underrepresented groups. Improving access to information, reducing logistical barriers, and developing educational campaigns that strengthen trust in the electoral system are some measures that could help reverse the abstention scenario in the country. Brazilian democracy must be strengthened by citizen participation, which requires all sectors of society to feel motivated and empowered to exercise their right to vote.

(Analysis) Trump 2.0: What Does It Mean For Argentina and Brazil?,"The US elections and Donald Trump’s victory will undoubtedly bring changes to the formulation of American foreign policy and, consequently, to the entire international system as a whole.
In this article, we aim to analyze how Trump 2.0 could impact American foreign policy in relation to Argentina and Brazil, while also shedding light on what to expect from the relationship between these two countries and the US.
Javier Gerardo Milei expressed satisfaction and quickly showed the good relationship he shares with the U.S. president-elect by congratulating him on his “formidable electoral victory” with a post on x.com.Additionally, a week after the election, Milei and Trump had a phone call, during which Trump reportedly told Milei“You are my favorite president.”
The strong connection between the two leaders went beyond statements and phone calls. On November 14, the Argentine president traveled to the U.S. to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held at Donald Trump’s residence in Palm Beach. Milei became the first foreign leader to meet with President Trump after his election victory. During their meeting, Trump said, “Javier, I want to congratulate you on the work you’ve done to make Argentina great again. It’s incredible how you’re fixing things,” and added, “You are a MAGA person.”
In contrast, on November 08, 2024 President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, gave an interview to Christiane Amanpour and stated that he plans to have a respectful relationship with President-elect Donald J. Trump.
The official statement followed a phone call to Trump congratulating him for winning the election and goes hand in hand with theBrazilian International Relations policy of having a sound relationship with the US.
Regardless of Lula’s intent to maintain a respectful relationship with Trump, the letter’s victory hasfurther consequences for Brazil’s political landscapebeyond the foreign relations of both countries. Since the American president-elect has a close relationship with former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Trump’s election has played a key role in rekindling the far-right movement in Brazil, which opposes President Lula’s leftist administration.
President Trump’s first termwas marked by a protectionist agenda[SS1].He raised taxes on multiple products,from washing machines to steel, and imposed higher tariffs on goods coming from China and even Europe.

The imposition of these tariffs has caused ramifications other than simply the rise of trade costs. In 2019, as president, Trump blocked appointments to the World Trade Organization (WTO) appellate body disabling the organ’s dispute settlement system, among other actions that demonstrated Trump’s disdain for multilateralism, the liberal order, and globalization (withdrawal from the Paris Agreement,reduction of funding for United Nations agencies, amongst others)
Regarding Argentina, the first Trump era (2017–2021), the Republican shared the time in the presidency with Mauricio Macri (2015–2019) and Alberto Fernández (2019–2023).
The Macri-Trump tandem found some common ground but fell far short of the“carnal relations”[SS3]of the Menem era. It’s worth noting that Macri pursued a foreign policy more aligned with multilateralism than with the bilateralism preferred by Trump. Additionally, Macri’s administration initially placed its bets on Hillary Clinton winning the U.S. election.
Although Macri managed to balance his support for Clintonwith a personal connection to Trump and a shared interest in golf, the Republican administration maintained a protectionist policy and rhetoric against globalization and multilateralism. Despite these differences, Trump didn’t abandon Macri, understanding the importance of having an ally in the Casa Rosada after years of opposing governments in the Southern Cone.

In this context, despite their differing approaches to foreign policy and some tariff measures (steel, lemons, and biodiesel),the Trump administration supported the 2018 IMF loan disbursementand supported Macri’s campaign against the Peronist Front. With Fernández ‘s victory and the onset of the Covid pandemic, relations cooled for the next year and a half, and the Casa Rosada hoped for Biden’s victory.
On the other hand, the relationship between Brazil and the US has varied over time.In the year 2000s Brazil was mostly led by presidents of the Workers’ Party (PT),President Lula from 2003 until 2010 and later President Dilma Rousseff from 2011 until 2016. As their foreign relations agenda focused on strengthening the Global South, they became more distant from the United States and grew closer to southern countries.
In 2016 President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, being replaced by her vice-president Michel Temer from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). Temer’s foreign relations policy was different from that of PT’s governments. The first was more rooted in the Liberal World Order than the latter. Whereas from 2009 until 2016 the president of the United States was Barack Obama, whose vision of the international system was shared by Temer, from 2017 on, Donald Trump became president and preached an anti-liberal foreign policy.
As Temer and Trump’s views of how the world should be were different, the first assumed a neutral stance toward the latter. We could broadly say thatthe Temer-Trump relationship focused on regional issues, mainly the situation of the Chavista government in Venezuela.
When Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil’s president in 2019, the period of distance between both countries came to an end. Due to the similarity in the policies of both the Brazilian and the United States’ governments in that period,their relationship started to become closer once again.
Regarding his geopolitical vision, it is believed that Trump will prioritize the dispute with China as the main threat to American hegemony. In this context, Trump considers it crucial to eliminate any other uncertainties that might divert the U.S. from its primary concern: China. Trump’s policy toward the Asian country will likelycontinue along the lines he initiated, followed by Biden, ultimately solidifying China as the U.S.’s primary antagonist, but with the difference of distancing the US from expenses and conflicts that, geopolitically and under Trump’s vision, do not generate any benefit for the US.
For the mentioned purposes, Trump will likely aim to keep the“backyard”orderly and secure. The potential appointment of Florida Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State carries certain particularities. Beyond being the first Spanish-speaking, Cuban-American(and anti-China hawk)to hold this position, Rubio’s appointment would likely bring increased attention to the Latin American region, with a strong focus on pressure against the left and efforts to counter any Chinese interference on the continent.

In this sense, it is expected that Milei will become a major ally, not only due to the exotic nature of his discourse and his outsider profile, which resembles Trump but also as a stronghold and key ally for the White House in the Southern Cone and in its global rhetoric against the left.
The relationship between the presidents is in a honeymoon phase, but as with Macri or Menem in the 1990s, this doesn’t guarantee concessions or investments. Milei, however, stands out with his strong anti-left rhetoric, global visibility, and unique position as a right-wing leader with regional influence and political strength, even as thepink tideresurges in countries like Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile.
However, perhaps the main issue Argentina might face in its relationship with Trump is that, beyond their mutual dislike of the left, there are no shared “ideologic political components between their approaches to political communication and the idea of de-bureaucratizing the state. To simplify for the reader, Trump is a nationalist protectionist, while Milei is a libertarian liberal who, in his own words,“wants to destroy the state.”
Regarding Brazil, a brief analysis shows that while personal relationships between the presidents of Brazil and the United States are significant, the deep-rooted ties between the two countries limit the impact of such relationships. Brazil and the United States have historically had a good relationship.The US recognized Brazilian independence in 1824 and they have had an amicable relationship ever since.
What we can undoubtedly establish is that Trump’s stance on China holds particular importance for Brazil, as both countries are founding members of the BRICS group. At this year’s BRICS Summit, Brazil proposed an agenda to create a BRICS currency for use in international trade, replacing the dollar. Additionally,Brazil and China have previously conducted transactions using the Real and the Yuan instead of the American currency.
Upon BRICS country’s actions to become less dependent on the dollar, president-elect Trump has stated that if a currency is established by the group or if they trade goods using any currencies other than the dollar, he would impose 100% taxes on all of them. The imposition of 100% taxes by the US on Brazilian products would have a great impact on Brazilian trade since the US is Brazil’s second greatest economic partner, following only China.
It is not possible to know what actions Brazil will take upon such a statement. Nevertheless, the country has the diplomatic tradition of non-alliance, which means that the biggest country in Latin America has a culture of maintaining good relationships with any other state, always open to new negotiations. Such tradition was demonstrated after Brazil refused China’s invitation to become a part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), at the same time that it signaled it was willing to continue having healthy relations with the Asian country. What we can initially expect is concern from Lula’s government over increased tariffs on Brazilian products, support for pro-Bolsonaro sectors in electoral matters, and divergences in international forums regarding environmental policies.

Xi Jinping’s Visit Highlights Brazil’s Cautious Balancing Act,"This past November, China’s President, Xi Jinping,visited Braziland held promising, high-profile talks with his Brazilian counterpart, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva. While Brazil hosted the G-20 Summit, Xi’s state visit sparked commentary andmobilized attentionon what ended up being a consequential meeting between Brazil and its largest trading partner.
Reflecting upon the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, the two countries’ leaders signed 37 trade and diplomatic agreements, which ranged from agriculture, renewable energy and infrastructure development. Marking a renewed commitment between South America’s largest economy and China, these agreements prompted Xi Jinping to comment on the relationship’s excellent status, which was reportedly characterized by him as being at“an all-time high.”
Building upon these agreements on a wide set of economic sectors, Xi’s visit was also concluded with astatementthat reaffirmed Brazil and China’s common view on Ukraine, Palestine, and international geopolitical issues. The geopolitical sintony between these high-caliber Global South giants, however, is not impervious to challenges and is often met with a nuanced balancing act by Brasilia.
While China’s inroads in Latin America have been widely observed anddiscussedin the context of its hegemonic struggle with the United States, Brazil’s position over the last years has been marked by a cautious balancing act. After a tumultuous and histrionic Bolsonaro government, which squabbled frequently with China – especially during pandemic-relatedvaccine issues– Lula’s return to Brazil’s presidency signalled a promise of good relations with China and of a reprisal of high-profile international agency, one of Lula’s first tenure’s hallmarks.
While China cruised through Bolsonaro’s tenure and kept its place as Brazil’s largest trading partner and privileged destiny of Brazil’s huge agribusiness sector, Lula’s tenure has not been marked by a full-on, aggressive buy-in into the BRICS and BRI projects as some might have guessed beforehand.
From playing a role inpivoting away from Venezuela’s Nicolas Madurotorefusing outright to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative(or New Silk Road), Brazil has signalled to beperhaps more interested in playing a rather reserved and cautious balancing game.
While counting on China and Russia’s consent,Venezuela’s joining of BRICS was blocked by Brazil, which has tried to position itself as a guarantor of democracy in the country, assuming an anti-Maduro and often confrontational tone. Simultaneously, Brazil’s strategic advisor and historical foreign policy figure, Celso Amorim, has signaled thatBrazil would debate “synergies” with the BRI project, rather than outright joining it wholesale, as an “insurance policy.”.
As these themes mark Brazil’s topical disagreements with Beijing, the upcoming second Trump tenure is sure to influence Brasilia’s balancing act. While Brazil might be hedging its strategy by siding with the United States in matters, such as Venezuela, and by not outright joining BRI, a Trump administration is by nature unpredictable and can harbor unpleasant surprises for the South American country’s strategy.
At the same time, Lula faces domestic struggles regarding his relationship with Congress and considering the high-profile investigations targeting Bolsonaro and his circle following the disclosing of abotched coup attemptin 2022. The investigations have recently gained momentum and resulted in thearrest of Bolsonaro’s 2022 vice-President nominee, Brazilian four-star General Braga Netto, the first arrest of such a figure in the country’s history. The U.S.’s historical role in Brazilian politics is sure to be a recurring theme as the investigators hover around Bolsonaro and his closer associates.
As Brazil’s domestic political scenario develops into muddier waters, its foreign policy seeks to conduct this hedging strategy of a balancing act between Beijing and Washington. At the same time, China’s profile in Latin America only grows and selected partners are already harvesting important gains, such as Peru’s latestport infrastructure win.
In conclusion, while these themes might indicate some “trouble in Paradise” for the two Global South giants, the fact is that Brazil and China’s relationship continuesas a stalwart of BRICS strategy and a growing multipolar world order alternative. Brasilia’s cautious hedging act can be better understood when we take stock of Lula’s domestic struggles and an upcoming second Trump tenure. As 2025 rolls around, this lesser “Triangular Diplomacy” is sure to bring attention and thought to Latin America and beyond.
Questions for Readers
1 – How should Brazil approach its relationship with China, considering the upcoming Trump administration?
2 – How does the upcoming Trump administration influence Brazil’s domestic force correlation, considering the high-profile investigations targeting Bolsonaro and his botched coup attempt?
3 – What role can Brazil and Latin America play in the larger context of hegemonic dispute between Beijing and Washington?

Libya Peace Initiative: Can Egypt and Türkiye’s Efforts End the Political Deadlock?,"Libya has entered its thirteenth year without a unified central government. (Source: SkyTG24. Licensed under theAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Internationallicense. No changes to the original picture made.)
Almost fourteen years have passed since October 20, 2011 — the day Muammar Gaddafi, the longtime leader of the LibyanJamahiriyaand de facto president,was found hiding in a drainage pipe near Sirte and executed by revolutionary forces. It was a day many hoped would mark Libya’s first step toward democracy and long-awaited freedoms. But instead of ushering in a new era,it plunged the country into a spiral of chaos.
The factions that had united to overthrow theBrotherly Leader— as Gaddafi liked to call himself — quickly turned one against the other, each hoping to seize control of the country’s institutions and natural wealth. Over time, two dominant camps emerged: the Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli, now led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, and the Government of National Stability (GNS) in Sirte, nominally headed by Osama Hammad, but effectively under the control of Khalifa Haftar, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army.
For more than a decade, these factions have been locked in a power struggle, backed by competing foreign patrons. Yet, neither has managed to secure full power or international recognition, leaving Libya and its people suspended in a limbo. One attempt after another at reconciliation has faltered, each collapsing under the weight of distrust, diverging ambitions, and greed.
Now, however, a new initiative is beginning to take shape. As Türkiye and Egypt recalibrate their priorities and step forward as mediators, cautious optimism is beginning to stir; a hope that this time, the path may finally lead somewhere different.
The optimism surrounding the Egypt–Türkiye initiative stems from the critical roles both countries have played in Libya’s fractured landscape.
In September, Sisi visited Türkiye for the first time and held discussions with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, addressing several topics, including the situation in Libya.(Source:NEW DEMOCRACY  on Flickrlicensed under theAttribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Genericlicense. No changes to the original picture made)
Since the outbreak of the second civil war in 2014, Cairo and Ankara have supported opposing sides: Egypt has been a key backer of the GNS, providing military, diplomatic, and financial support to Haftar’s camp, while Türkiye has thrown its weight behind the GNU. Their involvement helped narrow the field of contenders and block extremist groups like ISIS from gaining a foothold. But it also deepened Libya’s internal fractures and cemented the political deadlock. Now,as Türkiye and Egypt mend ties after nearly thirteen years of hostility, a new opportunity appears to be emerging. At a summit in Ankara in September 2024,Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi pledged to work together to resolve the Libyan crisis, committing to use their influence over their respective allies to foster dialogue and pursue a lasting political solution.
This engagement is far from being dictated by a sincere interest in Libya’s fate. It is driven by strategic necessity. As both countries are grappling with shrinking resources and rising domestic discontent, Libya represents a potential lifeline.
For Türkiye, a stable Libya could offer lucrative reconstruction and infrastructure contracts, providing a chance to capitalise on its expertise in construction and development. For Egypt, it could unlock energy cooperation and new export markets to help ease over a year of state-imposed power cuts and mounting economic pressure. Beyond these economic motives, a diplomatic success in Libya would boost both countries’ standing as regional power brokers, not just in North Africa but across the Middle East. In short, the convergence of domestic urgency, strategic incentives, and improving bilateral ties has opened a window for joint action.
Since their meeting in September, the Turkish and Egyptian governments have begun taking concrete steps in Libya by engaging directly with key actors on both sides.Turkish intelligence chief İbrahim Kalın has met with GNU leader Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, whileForeign Minister Hakan Fidan has held talks with Belkacem Haftar, the son of the eastern commander and an emerging power broker. On the Egyptian side,President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has met with Khalifa Haftar himself. These actions suggest that Ankara and Cairo are now actively coordinating their efforts to help broker a resolution.
And the first signs that the recent diplomatic thaw is yielding results on the ground are beginning to appear. While no official roadmap has been made public, recent developments point to a slow but meaningful shift in tone and cooperation between the GNU and the GNS.
In a major step forward,both sides agreed last September to jointly appoint a new central bank governor. They have alsoallowed local elections to resume across all 58 municipalitiesafter years of delay. These actions are more than symbolic. After nearly a decade of avoiding meaningful collaboration, this new willingness to cooperate signals a turn toward pragmatic coexistence.
Libya’s political deadlock finds its roots in disputes over the distribution of revenues — particularly from oil and gas production — between the elite families in the country’s east and west.(Source:Cipiota, licensed under theAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unportedlicense. No changes to the original image made).
What could keep this momentum going is the creation of a shared economic framework. After all, the conflict has always been, at its core, about control of resources. By unfreezing stalled investments and ensuring a fair distribution of oil revenues, both sides would gain tangible benefits — the kind of incentives that make long-term unity more likely. This is a clear area where Türkiye and Egypt could focus their efforts, helping to unify Libya’s divided leadership by acting as guarantors of wealth-sharing agreements.
Whether these developments will lead to lasting peace remains uncertain. Tensions between the two rival administrations — and even within them,as recent clashes in Tripoli show— highlight just how fragile the current situation still is, and the limits any agreement might face.
Yet the efforts by Turkish and Egyptian officials as intermediaries point to a more hopeful path. If Türkiye and Egypt can sustain their cooperation, and if Libya’s rival factions can move beyond blind rivalry and commit to a shared, pragmatic vision of state-building, then the long-awaited dream of a unified, functional Libya may finally be within reach.
For a population worn down by war and broken promises, finally be the long-awaited light at the tunnel’s end.
Could this be the moment when the code to peace is finally cracked? As many Libyans would say:insha’Allah.

(Analysis) North Korea’s Troop Deployment To Russia-Ukraine War: Stategic Gamble?,"The Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point of global attention, with daily updates on attacks, casualties, and shifting battlefronts. The conflict has long transcended its initial boundaries, drawing in actors and interests far beyond the two warring nations. While early reports have highlighted North Korea’s (DPRK)supply of munitionsto Russia- actions that might align with typical ally support. Recent revelations have sent shockwaves through the international community.
In October,intelligenceconfirmed DPRK has dispatched troops to support Russia’s war efforts. This marks the first direct involvement of a foreign power in the conflict. Raising critical questions: What drives Pyongyang to make such a risky and provocative move? And what ripple effects might this have on the geopolitical landscape?
Evidence suggests these soldiers are operating more as mercenaries than formal military personnel. These troops arereportedlydressed in Russian military uniforms. Such actions can be seen as Russia’s attempt to eliminate the presence offoreign fighterson the battlefield.South Korea’s Defense Ministerhas emphasized that this North Korean personnel, when engaged on the battlefield, should be classified as a mercenary body rather than state-dispatched troops.
Nevertheless, the mercenary label does little to diminish the significance of DPRK’s involvement in the conflict. Signaling its willingness to bolster its ally Russia while avoiding accusations of invading foreign countries.
The secretive nature of DPRK makes it challenging to uncover the details of its troop deployment. Estimations of their numbers vary widely, from around11,000 to as many as 100,000. There have been recent reports of heavy casualties on the frontline or Russian troops complaining about the DKK troops. It may instantly make people feel Kim sent poorly trained and inexperienced troops. Dismiss these soldiers as cannon fodder, relying on sheer numbers in a nod to old-fashioned tactics, but the picture might not be as straightforward as it seems.
Storm Crops
North Korean military defectors reveal a surprising twist: Kim deployed Pyongyang’s elite “Storm Corps.” Although not conventional frontline soldiers, this unit isrigorously trained in infiltration, infrastructure sabotage, and assassinations. Defectors warn that underestimating these troops would be a grave mistake. Moreover, the defector suggested Kim would not want to embarrass himself or undermine Putin. Indicating that these soldiers are likely specially selected for the mission.
More Detailed Interview with ex-North Korean Soldiers:“Don’t underestimate North Korean troops in Russia”, Jean Mackenzie, BBC, 20 Dec 2024
For Russia
North Korea’s offer of manpower appears highly appealing. The conflict, now stretching into its third year. It has seen both sides employ a mix of conventional and hybrid tactics. Among these, Russia’s reliance on age-old battlefield strategies—such as the“meat grinder” and “flooding”tactics—has drawn significant attention.
The“meat grinder”prioritizes overwhelming the enemy through sheer troop density and relentless intensity, blending elements of attrition and mass mobilization. This strategy has yielded somesuccess: reports indicate that Russia has captured or retaken approximately 2,350 square kilometers (907 square miles) in eastern Ukraine and parts of Russia’s western Kursk region. However, thecost is staggering. Relying on brute manpower has resulted in catastrophic casualties, with U.S. and U.K. intelligence estimating up to 1,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded daily.
Despite these losses, Russia’s commitment to this approach shows no signs of waning. Putin has recently ordered therecruitmentof an additional 180,000 troops, bringing the Russian army to nearly 2.4 million.
Against this backdrop, North Korea’s willingness to provide manpower emerges as an attractive proposition for Russia. Moscow gains reinforcements without further exhausting its resources, extending the viability of its high-casualty strategies.
For North Korea
This integrated support likely serves as astrategic trade-offfor food and resources from Russia.Reportedly, these soldiers are paidUSD $2000per month. Pyongyang appears to have placed most of its bets on its relationship with Moscow than Beijing. As evidenced by the recent strengthening of ties between the two nations. Signaling a shift away from its traditionally China-centric approach.
Additionally, North Korea’s involvement in Russia’s war offers its military a rare opportunity to gainvaluable combat experience—something it has not had on a significant scale since the Korean War.Some commentators see it as a preparation for any future hot wars on the Korean Peninsula. Persistent resource shortages, including fuel and materials, have hindered the DPRK military’s ability to conduct adequate training. Nuclear development has dominated North Korea’s focus, leaving other military capabilities underdeveloped. Hence, participation in the conflict provides a chance to bridge this gap, further bolstering its operational capabilities.
Suspected Domestic Stability in North Korea
Before delving into the broader geopolitical implications, it’s worth considering that North Korea’s bold move may also reflect internal challenges Kim Jong-un is grappling with. Dr. Kim Dong-su, a former North Korean diplomat, recently shared his perspective in a private conversation. Indicating that Kim’s decision to send special forces in exchange for food and resources could be symptomatic of the regime’s dire domestic situation. He hinted that the Kim regime may not be as secure as previously believed, suggesting that internal pressures are likely driving such a risky decision.

Forging Stronger Ties: North Korea-Russia Partnership
The deployment of DPRK troops in supporting Russia’s war effort underscores the deepening ties between Russia and North Korea. Marking a shift from a transactional relationship to a more enduring strategic and ideological partnership. In June 2024, the two nations solidified their alliance throughTreaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The treaty encompasses a mutual defense agreement alongside expanded cooperation in economic, scientific, labor, and technological sectors. A shared commitment to long-term collaboration.
Since the agreement, reports indicate a dramaticincrease in the supply of artilleryfrom Pyongyang to Moscow, as well as the presence of North Korean military advisors on Russian battlefields. And DPRK troops in the Russia-Ukraine War. These developments not only highlight the growing interdependence between the two countries but also reflect their alignment in confronting shared adversaries and bolstering their respective geopolitical ambitions.
Will Other Russia’s Allies Step Deeper Into the Conflict?
A firmly established alliance between North Korea and Russia raises questions about the potential involvement of Russia’s other close allies, such as Belarus or even members of theCollective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which includes Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Could Moscow exert pressure on Belarus, its steadfast European ally, to follow North Korea’s example by providing more direct assistance to Russia in its war efforts?
The likelihood of Russia’s other partners taking such a bold step as North Korea remains low given North Korea’s uniquely isolated position on the international stage. If such developments materialize, the Russia-Ukraine war could escalate from a covertly factional conflict into an overt bloc-versus-bloc confrontation. This shift would not only prolong the war but also increase the likelihood of its spread into other regions, resulting in a dangerous horizontal escalation that destabilizes global security even further.
China’s Quite Respond: Balancing Interest Amid Rising Tension
China has remained notably silent regarding the deployment of DPRK troops to support Russia, the deepening ties between Russia and DPRK, and the broader conflict itself. This measured response reflects China’s foreign policy approach ofbalancing between parties without making overtly clear statements.
Nevertheless, both Russia and North Korea remain strategic partners for China. For instance, China maintains a bilateral strategic partnership described as having“no limits”with each of them. With the growing certainty of a bilateral alliance between Russia and North Korea, and China’s established ties with both. One might question whether the emergence of a trilateral alliance or bloc is on the horizon. If such an alliance were to emerge, it could be perceived as a concerted effort to promote their shared worldview.

Expanding Frontlines: The Conflict’s Shift Beyond Europe
North Korea’s direct involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict has raised alarms in South Korea. While there are currently no plans to deploy South Korean troops, the country has signaled the possibility of lifting the weapons sales ban on Ukraine.South Koreamay also consider sending military personnel to Ukraine to monitor the presence of North Korean troops and assist in managing potential North Korean prisoners of war.
The growing cooperation between North Korea and Russia could signal an anti-U.S. front. This development could also suggest that should a conflict arise on the Korean Peninsula, Russia may take a similar approach, further increasing uncertainty and instability in the region.
Experts argue that North Korea’s military involvement aligns with Russia’s broader foreign policy strategy, which envisions Russia as a vast Eurasian and Euro-Pacific power. Russia’s key foreign policy priorities include the Arctic, Eurasia, the Indo-Pacific, and the Global South. As theU.S. and Europe intensify their focus on the Indo-Pacific, a shift that runs counter to Putin’s interests. Russia has responded by strengthening North Korea’s military and nuclear capabilities in the region. This deepening China-North Korea-Russia alignment reflects a broader strategy to expand their influence and counter Western ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.
What drives North Korea to take the extraordinary step of sending troops to the battlefield? While the precise motivations remain elusive, they are likely multifaceted and deeply complex. The war in Ukraine may divert European attention, but North Korea’s involvement signals a broader shift, expanding the conflict beyond Europe with far-reaching geopolitical implications. As Pyongyang deepens its ties with Moscow, the ripple effects could reshape alliances, heighten tensions, and significantly impact security dynamics, particularly in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

Until recently, relations between the Netherlands and China could have been described as cordial and robust with many areas of cooperation including agriculture, human rights, culture, arts and media, and science and innovation. Last year, the Netherlands was the largest importer from China with 117 billion euros. It was also one of the largest exporters to China with trade accounting for 22 billion euros. It also had thelargest trade deficitat 95 billion euros.
However, despite stable relations, in 2019, the Netherlands marked a shift from its China strategy, naming itThe Netherlands China: A New Balance. Under this policy, the Netherlands departed from its previous approach of attracting Chinese investments and adopted a more restrained defensive action plan. Although the government wished to continue bilateral cooperation in key areas, it also showed signs of caution in trading advanced technologies. The policy aligned with the European Union’s increasing skepticism towards Beijing andthe US’ economic and political pressures. In 2023, the Netherlands imposed export controls on lithography machines, which attracted some Chinese criticism. A year later, it decided to further expand the scope of export control measures, furtherdeteriorating Sino-Dutch trade relations.

The Netherlands, also referred to as the digital gateway to Europe, is considered one of the best and most highly advanced countries in the world in terms of IT and digital infrastructure. It ranks 8th on theGlobal Innovative Indexand 5th on theWorld Competitiveness Rankingand hence, it offers a lucrative business investment climate, from start-ups to multinational enterprises. The Netherlands is also home to ASML Holding N.V., which is arguably the biggest company operating in the development, production, marketing, and sale of advanced semiconductor hardware. It has a monopoly over the supply of lithography machines, which are used to manufacture computer chips. China, on the other hand, assumes the role of being its third largest consumer and thus serves as an important partner in the bilateral relations with the Netherlands. However, given its technical prowess and skilled manpower, in terms of academics and professionals, it becomes a vulnerable target for cyberattacks and web espionage. As a result, the Sino-Dutch trade and economic relations are increasingly affected by security concerns.
In April 2023, a Dutch intelligence and security service agency known by its acronymAIVDalleged China to be the biggest threat to the Netherlands’ economic security with China using commercial espionage, illegal covert investments, and exports to target Dutch experts, scientists, and companies. In its annual assessment report, AIVD and the Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) jointly investigated the national security threats posed by China. It discovered with ‘high confidence’ that China had attempted to gain access to Dutch technological and trade secrets to improve its technical know-how, with the ASML being a major target. Furthermore, they discovered that China was also trying to obtain confidential corporate information for the benefit of Chinese companies and government institutions. Though Beijing denied these accusations, AIVD alleged Chinese spiescommitted a cyberattackcompromising a sensitive military force network.
Apart from security-related concerns, the Hague has acknowledged that since China is not a market economy or a democracy founded on the principles of the rule of law, it conflicts with the values upheld by them. So, Amsterdam wishes to end the unfair trading practices and wants a more balanced and dignified relationship with the country. It has made itself clear in the policy document that it did not wish to become dependent on China for key technologies and critical raw materials. It also wanted to protect its intellectual property and wanted manageable investment risks to prevent unwanted technology transfer. Lastly, it was very skeptical about the risks of technological leaks such as those in environmental technology.
Though the Netherlands has its share of apprehensions concerningChina, the geopolitical conditions have significantly shaped their trade trajectory. The US-China trade war has severely impacted the Netherlands. China is aware of its dependency on the Western front for technologies such as semiconductors and seeks to develop advanced technology and emerge as a leading country in the industry. However, the US feels threatened by China’s vision. Given the USA’s position in the supply chain, it can and has put pressure on countries like the Netherlands and Japan to restrict China’s access. In 2023, the US pressured the Dutch government to curtail China’s acquisition of high-level technology. This included not issuing export licenses to ASML to deliver semiconductors to undisclosed Chinese customers. The Dutch high-tech company is the world’s sole producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, capable of manufacturing the next generation of advanced semiconductors. China, on the other hand, lags far behind in the technology of lithography, and therefore, a limit to semiconductors’ production would result in a disruption in its goal of self-sufficiency.
China, keeping in view its dependency, aims to become a world leader in the field of technology by 2025. China launched its industrial policy ‘Made in China 2025’ to make the country the global manufacturing hub of the world. This has been done to catch up with the West and ultimately surpass them. Made in China 2025 is a ten-year plan that includes AI, telecommunications, advanced robotics, next-gen IT, electric vehicles, etc. The main agenda is to reduce the dependence of Beijing on foreign technology and equip China with high-tech factors in the global market. The US, under Trump’s administration, had seen this not only as a violation of international regulations but also as a potential military threat. Warnings were given by the US that they would not supply the American inputs needed to produce ASML semiconductors. This has since led to a rise in the volatility of the global value chains of semiconductors.
A shift in the perceptions can be observed. Earlier economic interdependence was perceived as being beneficial for the countries involved as it not only gave a boost to those countries but also reduced the possibility of geopolitical conflicts. Now it is seen as a security risk as seen in the case of the Netherlands which is walking on a tightrope. On the one hand, it has to protect its domestic security and appease international players such as the US and the EU. On the other, China serves as one of its largest markets. Arecent meetingwas held between Chinese Premier Xi Jinping and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte amid rising tensions of export restrictions wherein the former emphasised for removal of artificial barriers to entry and called for deeper trade cooperation. At present, the future of trade relations between the two states seems to hold promise however careful considerations will have to be kept in mind for the Netherlands regarding its security concerns and for China regarding its economic aspirations.","May 19, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-deteriorating-sino-dutch-relations/,Harshita Prashar,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The Cycle of Conflict: Why the Status Quo Between Israel and Palestine Remains Unchanged,"The events of October 7 2023 in which Hamas launched a devastating surprise attack against Israel, have reignited the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and exposed vulnerabilities in Israel’s intelligence and military preparedness. However, despite the scale of this shock, history suggests that the current hostilities, like past confrontations, are unlikely to alter the current state of political and security affairs. Instead, this conflict fits into a recurring cycle in which Israel, initially caught unprepared, responds with overwhelming force to reestablish the superiority of its army and intelligence. This dynamic has played out repeatedly in Israel’s history, creating short-term victories but perpetuating long-term instability and enabling the rise of even more radical factions.Historical Precedents: Shock and PaybackThe Yom Kippur War (1973) is one of the most notable examples of this cycle. Israel’s intelligence, adhering to the flawed Conceptzia doctrine, failed to predict the coordinated surprise attack by Egypt and Syria. The initial shock resulted in heavy Israeli losses, threatening the survival of the state. However, Israel quickly reorganized its forces, counterattacking in both the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. Intelligence operations provided real-time battlefield data, enabling precise strikes and the encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army. By the war’s end, Israel had reclaimed its dominance, but the psychological damage of the surprise attack prompted widespread reforms in its intelligence community, which temporarily restored confidence. However, the war strengthened the first Assad regime in Syria, which had been extremely antagonistic towards Israel.Similarly, the Second Intifada (2000–2005) began as a wave of violent protests and suicide bombings that overwhelmed Israel’s security apparatus. Hamas emerged as a major player during this period, exploiting the discontent fueled by failed peace negotiations. Israel responded with Operation Defensive Shield, employing targeted assassinations and incursions into Palestinian territories to dismantle militant networks. The military successes and elimination of key leaders temporarily restored Israel’s sense of security but also cemented Hamas’ status as a dominant force in Gaza, setting the stage for future clashes.The 2006 Lebanon War followed a similar trajectory. Hezbollah’s cross-border raids and rocket attacks exposed vulnerabilities in Israel’s northern defenses. Israel launched a large-scale military campaign, heavily bombing Hezbollah positions and infrastructure. While Hezbollah survived the war, its operational capacity was degraded, and Israel’s deterrence was reestablished. Yet, Hezbollah emerged politically stronger, continuing to build its arsenal and influence with Iranian support, highlighting the limitations of Israel’s short-term military payback.

The Current Conflict: October 7 and BeyondThe October 7 attacks reflect yet another instance of Israel’s unpreparedness, this time involving failures in both intelligence (Shin Bet) and military readiness. Hamas’ infiltration and massacre revealed gaps in Israel’s surveillance systems and defense protocols. As in previous cycles, Israel has responded with overwhelming force, targeting Hamas’ infrastructure and leadership while conducting a ground offensive in Gaza. These actions aim to destroy Hamas as a military and political entity while restoring the perception of Israeli dominance.However, as history has shown, such payback operations often come with unintended consequences. The destruction of Hamas may create a power vacuum in Gaza, potentially allowing even more radical factions to rise. Islamic Jihad, or groups aligned with ISIS, could exploit the chaos, perpetuating the cycle of violence. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s involvement along Israel’s northern border suggests that Israel may face simultaneous threats, further testing its ability to maintain deterrence.The Intelligence Factor: Patterns of Failure and RecoveryIsraeli intelligence has often played a pivotal role in these cycles. While failures like the Yom Kippur War and October 7 highlight vulnerabilities, subsequent operations demonstrate Israel’s capacity to adapt and strike back effectively. The Mossad’s recent targeting of Hezbollah’s communications systems—specifically the destruction of their paging network—shows how Israel is already working to restore its intelligence dominance. Such actions reinforce the psychological and strategic deterrence that Israel relies upon, but they also risk escalating conflicts further.The reform of Israeli intelligence after the 1973 war led to improved integration between Mossad, Aman, and Shin Bet. Similarly, the aftermath of October 7 may prompt further restructuring to address systemic weaknesses. Yet, as in the past, these reforms are likely to focus on short-term recovery rather than addressing the root causes of conflict.The Rise of Radicalism: A Perpetual ThreatOne of the most troubling aspects of this cycle is its tendency to empower more radical factions. The expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon in 1982 led to the rise of Hezbollah, a more ideologically extreme and militarily sophisticated adversary. Similarly, the weakening of Fatah during the Second Intifada allowed Hamas to gain power in Gaza. The destruction of Hamas today risks opening the door to even more radical groups, further complicating efforts for long-term peace.The humanitarian toll of Israel’s military campaigns often fuels resentment, which extremists exploit to recruit and justify their actions. Each round of conflict deepens grievances, perpetuating the cycle of violence rather than resolving it.The recurring cycle of surprise, violence, and payback has defined Israel’s conflicts with its enemies, from the Yom Kippur War to the Second Intifada, the Lebanon War, and the ongoing battles with Hamas. Each clash exposes vulnerabilities in Israel’s defense, prompting reforms and decisive military actions to restore deterrence. However, these responses often leave deeper political and humanitarian wounds, fueling the rise of more radical adversaries and ensuring the continuation of hostilities.As Israel faces the aftermath of October 7, it once again seeks to reestablish its military and intelligence dominance. Yet history suggests that this effort, while effective in the short term, will not resolve the underlying dynamics of the conflict. Instead, it risks reinforcing the very conditions that give rise to future threats, leaving the status quo unchanged. “Peace through strength” has proven to be impossible: only a political solution and compromise can pave the way to peace and development.","June 11, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-cycle-of-conflict-why-the-status-quo-between-israel-and-palestine-remains-unchanged/,Yoel Liberanome,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The U.S Supreme Court: Legal Precedent and the Consequences of Noncompliance,"Image Credit:Ian Hutchinson(Unsplash)
There was a time when noncompliance with the U.S. Supreme Court felt like a thought experiment for the fringes, a rebellious what-if for law school hypotheticals or for history buffs fixated on Andrew Jackson’sapocryphal sneerat John Marshall. Today, that what-if is closer to apolitical blueprint. The quiet assumption that Supreme Court rulings must be obeyed, not because federal marshals arrive at the White House with handcuffs, but because disobedience triggers political extinction, is crumbling. What happens when a president, a governor, or an entire political party decides the Court can be safely ignored? The answer to that question is no longer theoretical as current developments give proof.
Judicial supremacy — the idea that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution is the final word — has always been a delicate fiction sustained by shared belief. The Court’s authority rests not on armies or money but on the acceptance, even by those who lose cases, that the Courtspeaksfor the Constitution itself. This understanding took hold slowly, through cases likeMarbury v. Madison, when in 1803 for the first time the Supreme Court declared a law, the Judiciary Act of 1789, as unconstitutional. This laid down the principle of judicial review, empowering the judiciary to strike down laws that violate the Constitution  But even then, this understanding relied on presidents and legislators deciding it was politically safer to comply than resist. In moments of extreme stress, the forced desegregation of public schools afterBrown v. Boardof Education, for example, the illusion was briefly exposed. The tanks Eisenhower sent toLittle Rockwere not just enforcing integration of black students; they were enforcing the legitimacy of the Supreme Court itself.
Article III of the Constitution is elegantly vague. It creates a judiciary, vests it with “judicial power,” and leaves much else unsaid. InMarbury v. Madison, the Court asserted the right to interpret the Constitution, and ever since, its legitimacy has rested precariously on the willingness of presidents and Congress to respect that claim. Judicial review is powerful in theory but defenseless in practice. The Court issues opinions, not arrest warrants. It has no enforcement arm, no practical ability to compel action. Its rulings live or die based on the political cost of defying them.
Legislative defiance of Supreme Court rulings is as old as Reconstruction and as modern as immigration fights at the border. Congress, state legislatures, and governors have sometimes slow-walked compliance, rewriting laws to test the edges of rulings, undermining enforcement through budget cuts or legal loopholes, or, as with southern segregationists afterBrown, openly resisting withcreative legal maneuvers.
What matters now is the subtle shift in posture: what used to be furtive defiance is becoming proud defiance. When Texas Governor Greg Abbott suggested ignoring aSupreme Court orderto dismantle border razor wire in 2024, it was not the quiet maneuvering of past resisters; it was a dare. In today’s fractured political environment, defiance of the Court isn’t a political liability — it’s a badge of honor.
The consequences are seismic. Separation of powers presumes each branch defends its own turf, but also that no branch openly declares itself free of the others. When the legislative branch flirts with nullification, it pulls the entire system closer to rupture, weakening an established delicately balanced system of power.
Presidents have historically respected Supreme Court rulings, even when they loathed them. Richard Nixonsurrenderedto the Watergate tapes. George W. Bush accepted defeat over Guantanamo detainees’habeas rights. Each of these moments reinforced the fragile spell: presidents can push, can grumble, but cannot outright defy the Court and will always remain within constitutional bounds.
Andrew Jackson’s infamous (andlikely mythical) response toWorcester v. Georgia, “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it”, was long treated as an anomaly, but its underlying implications reveal deep tensions in American constitutional history.Georgia v. Worcester(1832) was a significant Supreme Court case involving Samuel Worcester, a missionary living in Cherokee territory who was arrested by the state of Georgia for residing there without a state permit. The case, decided in 1832, was alandmark rulingin which Chief Justice John Marshall affirmed that Native American nations, specifically the Cherokee Nation, were sovereign entities and that the state of Georgia had no legal authority to impose its laws on Cherokee lands. The ruling was a direct rebuke to Georgia’saggressive effortsto remove Native Americans from their ancestral lands, which were being seized by white settlers under state authority.

Despite the Court’s decision, President Andrew Jackson, a staunch proponent of Indian removal, madeno effortto enforce the ruling. Instead, Georgia openly defied the Court, continuing its policies against the Cherokee people. The Supreme Court lacked the means to compel the state or the federal government to comply with its decisions without executive support. The practical result of this defiance was devastating. With no federal intervention to uphold the ruling, Georgia accelerated its efforts to remove the Cherokee, culminating in the forced displacement known as theTrail of Tears. Under theIndian Removal Act of 1830, Jackson had already set in motion the mass relocation of Native Americans from the Southeastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River. The federal government, under Jackson’s successor, Martin Van Buren, eventually deployed U.S. troops, not to enforce the Supreme Court’s ruling, but to forcibly evict the Cherokee, resulting in thousands of deaths from exposure, disease, and starvation.
This episode remains one of the most glaring examples of the Supreme Court’s reliance on executive and legislative branches to uphold its authority. Without a mechanism for direct enforcement, judicial decisions, no matter how constitutionally sound, can be rendered meaningless when those in power choose to ignore them.But Jackson governed in a time when executive defiance could be contained within the messy pre-modern framework of federalism and patronage politics. In the 21st century, when the presidency is both vastly more powerful and more insulated from consequence, the risk is existential. If a president decides that a Supreme Court ruling is politically inconvenient and simply ignores it, what mechanism exists to stop him? None — except public backlash and political penalty. If those evaporate, so does judicial authority.
This is not a theoretical debate. Should a future president refuse to comply with a ruling on immigration, election law, or federal investigations, there would be no magic button for the Court to press. Enforcement relies entirely on theexecutive branch’s willingnessto act against itself, a political ouroboros, a mythical symbol of a snake biting its own tail.
The rule of law, that most elegant fiction,  works because people believe it works. When disobedience carries political costs, presidents and governors choose compliance not out of affection for the Court, but out of self-interest. But in a polarized era where political basesreward defianceof institutions, that calculus changes. The price of ignoring the Court has shrunk, the rewards for defiance have grown.
What happens if noncompliance becomes routine? In the short term, constitutional order shudders butsurvives, just as it did in the years afterBrown. But over time, the gravitational center shifts. The Court’s rulings become suggestions, then opinions, and finally irrelevant noise. The judicial branch, once treated as the Constitution’s oracle, risks becoming little more than a debating society issuing advisory opinions to be ignored or obeyed based on political convenience.
This is not the road to authoritarianism. It is the road to constitutional entropy, where checks and balances dissolve not because anyone abolishes them, but because no one respects them.
If the Supreme Court wants to protect itself from this fate, it needs to understand the difference between power and legitimacy. Power comes from rulings; legitimacy comes from broad public respect across the political spectrum. For decades, the Court spent its legitimacy as if the supply were endless.Dobbs,Shelby County,Bush v. Gore, each decision chipped away at the presumption that the Court was above politics. Restoring that legitimacy will take more than careful rulings. It will take institutional humility.

Congress could alsostep in, legislating clearerenforcement mechanismsfor Supreme Court rulings, creating automatic triggers for executive action when the Courtorders compliance, or even (in a more radical move) giving the Court some independentenforcement capacity. None of this would be easy or quick. But the alternative, leaving the Court to dangle, hoping that noncompliance remains rare, is a gamble with constitutional survival itself.
In the end, the Supreme Court’s authority depends not on law, but onbelief. Belief that rulings matter. Belief that defiance carries a price. Belief that even presidents must obey. That belief isweaker nowthan at any point since the Civil Rights Era, and the Court’s own choices have helped weaken it.
In the years ahead, if political incentives continue to reward defying the Court, the consequences will spread far beyond any single ruling or administration. A constitutional democracy cannot survive if the Court becomes a paper tiger, respected only when convenient, ignored when inconvenient. Legal precedent, the slow accumulation of meaning and authority, can dissolve faster than anyone expects if it ceases to command respect.
In the end, the Supreme Court’s power is only what others allow it to be. If the age of compliance ends, the age of the Court may end with it.

A Security Economic Dialogue? The Deft Diplomacy Behinds Oslo’s Joint Statement with China on their Green Cooperation,"Joint Statement Between the Kingdom of Norway and the People’s Republic of China, available athttps://www.regjeringen.no/
On 9 September 2024, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre led a delegation on his three-day official visit to China. After their arrival, Støre emphasized the importance of maintaining bilateral dialogue and cooperation despite contentions on geopolitical events in an interview. During his visit to Shanghai Fudan University, Støre gave a speech, diplomatically presenting Norway’s future potential cooperation with China, including the Polar explorations, Northern Sea Route (NSR) cooperation, and energy transition partnership. Concluding the trip on a productive note, Støre signed the Joint Statement on the Establishment of Dialogue on the Green Transition (hereafter Statement), underscoring the synergy in promoting the Norwegian energy transition progress. However, the Statement is ostensibly focused on energy cooperation, but the latent meanings have far greater implications than mere energy matters, which is their latent strategic security economic dialogue. Therefore, how could the Statement potentially renew Norway’s changing security economic environment?
What motivated Støre’s administration to reach the Statement is the global energy transformation pressures on the Norwegian national economy. These pressures created a lurking problem for its fiscal reserve. For instance, the currentstructural non-oil fiscal deficittrend has been steadily increasing in recent years (See Figure 1), despite the number remaining slightly positive with fiscal impulse (See Figure 2). However, its oil and natural gas production is forecasted to decline drastically in the next 25 years, with 83% and 44% respectively (See Figure 3), entailing theending hydrocarbon era. Meanwhile, as anexport-oriented economywith over 47.2% of its GDP, itsexport structureprimarily relies on the hydrocarbon sector, which adds more future economic challenges.
To ease these burdens, the Norwegian state promulgated itsgreen competitiveness strategyto usher in its energy economic transition. It outlines that Norway would diversify its economic and export structures by advancing renewables to buffer the aforementioned challenges.
Yet, the path toward energy transition remains onerous. Firstly, while the government could alter its export structure, theprogressmust be speedy to compensate for the gradual loss of hydrocarbon exports to ensure its smooth landing. To do this, Oslo has to construct a substantial amount of renewable sectors swiftly, but it requires significant domestic energy investments. Nevertheless, Norway currently faces several financial, technological, and regulatory hurdles before establishing a well-developed renewable ecosystem, especially when domestic energy enterprises are unwilling to invest domestically. Secondly, Norway has to bolster its carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities and power grid network building nationwide before the smooth transition can materialize.
Facing such governance challenges, these headache problems contributed to Støre’s trip to China. The reason for choosing China is that the country excels at renewable production of many kinds, catering to Norway’s short-termdevelopmental goalsin developing solar and hydrogen energies, and establishing more offshore wind turbines. Benefiting from the well-planned green industrial strategy, enormous industrial base, and advanced technological hub, China became aglobal new energy center. Meanwhile, the country has grasped a complete supply chain in renewables, including the upstream, middle, and downstream, making China an unavoidable partner.
For instance, China holdsover 90%of the global manufacturing capacity in solar panels, including the reservation, extraction, and processing of transition-critical materials like polysilicon, wafers, and lithium. For hydrogen energy,electrolyzersare a critical technology for producing low-carbon hydrogen for energy usage, and China now occupies 40% of the global capacity. While the traditional hydrogen production method is based on fossil fuel production, China successfully conducteddirect seawater electrolysisof hydrogen while integrating this technology with offshore wind turbines. Several months later, a Chinese firm, CNOOC, speedily applied this new technology to amegawatthydrogen production for industrial usage, largely meeting Norway’s developmental needs.
Meanwhile, China builtnearly half (46.1%)of the global offshore wind turbine installation capacity in 2023. Currently, the country accounts for65%of turbine nacelle and critical components production globally, like blades and generators, making the country the central manufacturing hub. The economic scale of this industrial powerhouse also allows its manufacturers to produce products that are20% cheaperthan their Western counterparts. Consequently, this robust industrial presence makes Oslo hardly ignore China despiteEuropean manufacturers’ leadsin technological expertise.
Another economic standpoint is that Norway lacked domestic renewable investments, while China is looking for overseas markets. Since Norway’s limited market size is perceived asnon-lucrativefor energy investment returns, domestic energy enterprises are unwilling to contribute their efforts. In contrast, Chinese markets arehyper-competitive, and their practitioners are actively spotting overseas opportunities. As such, bilateral cooperation became a primary option for both sides to address energy transition needs by stimulating Chinese investments in Norwegian domestic offshore wind energy projects.
Apart from the renewables development, Oslo is also keen on China’s power grid technology and construction capability to enable nationwide power transmission that could penetrate across regions. On the one hand, the USA and China are spearheadingadvanced AI smart griddevelopment, and this technology is especiallyvitalfor breaking down energy access barriers for economic activities. On the other hand, China’s globally renownedultra-high-voltagetechnology is essential for efficient energy transmission across vast regions, helping Norway to overcome itsenergy interconnectedness bottleneckissue.
Last but not least, the Statement notes the bilateral willingness to propel their green vessel development. Specifically, Norway and China have different bright spots in green vessel construction. For instance, Norway is highly reputable ingreen maritime technology, and China is agigantic vessel manufacturing hub. Accordingly, cooperating with China could expeditiously lower the low-carbon emissions of Norway’s vessel industry by reducing the reliance on traditional-powered vessels for global shipments, achievingNorway’s climate commitments.
Notwithstanding, these bright aspects of their bilateral cooperation, implementing the Statement demands thoughtful balancing and navigation between national economic and security considerations. Firstly, although Chinese wind turbine manufacturers hold efficient and low-cost supply chains, bestowing Chinese firms with bettercomparable profitabilityversus Western counterparts, this worried the EU authorities and local wind industry stakeholders. Consequently, the EU is attempting to shield its wind industry by strengthening the supply chain resilience while diversifying supply sources via apolicy package. From this prism, Oslo had to deftly navigate between the bureaucratic opposition forces and industry incumbents in Europe before harmoniously cooperating with China.
Secondly, Støre’s administration spoke about their security considerations before the delegation group went to China, unveiling the ambivalent side of their bilateral cooperation. Taking thePort of Kirkenesof Svalbard as an example, it’s a valuable asset for NATO to closely monitor Russia and an outstanding geographical location to establish a logistics post for a future viable NSR. Yet, the port needs substantial infrastructural investments to materialize its strategic values, but China is the one that could realize it. Unavoidably, Oslo weighted national security considerations above local economic interests and disapproved of the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO)’s investments.
Anofficial statementfrom the Norwegian Minister of Justice and Public Security confirmed a slightly inclined prioritization of national security concerns over local economic values. The statement notes that Støre’s administration would balance the local economic stakes and overall security concerns when addressing COSCO’s investments. But, it also stresses that Svalbard is located in the High North, and it’s an ideal place to conductintelligence-gathering activities, like monitoring Russian submarine activities and collecting radar data for missile trajectory. Oslo worries that the current friendship between Russia and China could pose additional risks to the Norwegian security environment in the long term.
Nevertheless, despite Oslo’s security concerns, seeking closer economic ties with China also brought new security opportunities, paradoxically. This is evident in hisspeechwhen he expressed his security economic vision with China. Apart from envisaging the future NSR to better connect Europeasia, foreshadowing Oslo left room for maneuver on the Svalbard issue, Støre also notes the importance of managing Norway’s disputes with Russia, like the Barents Sea. While both sides settled their limitation line in 2010 for the Barents, the Kremlin is keen on Norwegian offshore hydrocarbon extraction installations. Subsequently, Støre presented the importance of the Green Shift for Norwegians and shared it with his Chinese counterparts. In this vein, one could argue that his administration attempts to cooperate more closely with China in renewable fields to lower the possibility of future energy disputes in the Barents due to hydrocarbon extraction.
Nevertheless, Trump’s second administration might even bring Norway and China into the security economic field. To illustrate that, firstly, Trump’s second administration will likely drawChina and the world closertogether in the new energy cooperation due to its passive status in developing renewables, and itsforeign policy preferencescould pull allies closer to Beijing. With the advancing technological expertise of China in the near term, it’s reasonable to believe that Oslo would be more willing to cooperate with Beijing than Washington in unfolding renewable projects.
Still, one might also notice that Trump, as a pragmatic businessman, could continue allowing domestic CCS firms to maintain robust connections with Norwegian enterprises if the overall national economic interests are jeopardized. Given theU.S. global leadershipin CCS technology, a crucial cooperation field in the Sino-NorwegianJoint Statement, maintaining close business ties with Norwegian firms could preserve American technological leadership and overseas merchandise interests. An example includesnot banningChina from purchasing American General Electric jet engines for China’s newly developed homegrown commercial jets amid their steep geoeconomic competition, shedding light on Trump’s deft economic diplomacy.
Secondly, Støre’s administration might extend an Olive Branch to China for their latent consensus on potential cooperation in the security aspect due to the absence of Trump America’s military promise. In the aforementioned Støre’s speech, he mentions his willingness to participate in the polar exploration with China, given Norway’s global geographical reach in the field, including Antarctica. ConsideringChina’s relatively latecomer statusin polar regions, one could reasonably understand that Støre’s administration might be soliciting China’s security promise in navigating Norway’s confrontation with the Russians against the backdrop of the raging war in Ukraine. In return, Norway could more actively invite China to partake in polar activities, such as climate research and humanitarian rescue missions, even including their further future security economic dialogue to harness the geopolitical confrontation with Russia. InAmerica’s falling security promisein the NATO leadership during the second Trump administration, scaling up the cooperation level with Beijing is a second-to-none option to prevent further conflicts spilling over with the Russians between NATO.
Simultaneously, Norway could become a vital dialogue partner between NATO and China. AlthoughTrump’s stanceon whether to keep the U.S.’s security promises to Taiwan is ambiguous, some American security experts noted that the importance ofcontinuing supportfor Taiwan is vital for American strategic assets globally (Another see:NATO and Asia). Given that Trump is attempting to broker abroad economic dealwith Beijing and might leverage Taiwan for discussion, NATO resources will be paramount to strengthen the position of U.S. representatives. Accordingly, Norway could play a vital role in buffering the tensions between both sides, especially when Oslo attempts to solve its national security needs with Russia through China.
From this view, the Statement has profound implications beyond what is ostensibly believed and is noteworthy of the implementation of the Statement as well as the evolving Norwegian-Sino relationships. Their bilateral cooperation is not going as smoothly as they might think. On the micro level, Oslo has to address the difficulties in financing Chinese offshore wind turbine manufacturers in Europe before they can undertake large-scale construction projects. For example, nowadays, increasing wind turbine generator (WTG) prices have reduced the bidding opportunities for WTG original equipment manufacturers, and European banks are unwilling to finance Chinese WTGs, straining the scale of Chinese projects. On the macro level, a call for aEuropean self-defense strategymakes it difficult to convince European partners to accept a similar security-economic arrangement with China.
Nevertheless, while Europe could achieve self-defense without the U.S., the European states will have tospend nearly 250 billion eurosannually on extra manpower and industrial support, implying a sudden surge of huge economic output and societal burdens. The current economic fundamentals of European states are lukewarm, like experiencing sputtering growth with uncertain economic policy direction and turmoil in geopolitical environments. It will test the fiscal and economic fundamentals of European fiscal authorities when they try to adopt and implement their self-defense budget. Accordingly, maintaining a latent consensus with China within a manageable scope from Oslo’s view would benefit Europe’s self-defense purpose in the short run, despite the opposition voices from the Arctic and NATO circles.
From this view, the Statement represents a masterpiece of Norway’s smart diplomacy to China. On the one hand, maintaining a latent security economic diplomatic relationship with Beijing could aptly balance the stakes between Svalbard’s local economic and overall national security concerns. On the other hand, the Statement’s full articles written only on renewables cooperation could serve as a pre-emptive measure. For instance, Oslo could shrug off the diplomatic pressures from NATO for its deepening relationship with China, but also cease the level of cooperation when its security environment does not permit it to happen.
In conclusion, all of these suggest that the Norwegian-Sino cooperation and their Statement have profound implications that are far beyond what many conceived of the changing security economic environment of Norway, and even of the Arctic Circle.

The European Court of Justice Verdict in a Time of Realignment,"On October 4, 2024, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) annulled the 2019 EU-MoroccoTradeandFishery Agreements. For the first time, the CJEU invalidated EU agreements on the grounds of the violation of international law. While the European Union tries to maintain a collaborative relationship with Rabat, it struggles withart. 73in the United Nations Charter, which defines “territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government”. Western Sahara is among those territories included in thelist, recognised since 1963.
With this landmark judgement, the Court of Justice confirmed thelack of involvementof the Polisario Front – the representative of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR)- during consultation. The misrepresentation raises concerns about territorial implications.  The favourable ruling still leaves open the revision of the agreements between the European institutions – Council and Commission – and the Alawite reign of Morocco.
Western Sahara was a Spanish colony from 1885 to 1975. After the formal retirement of Spain in February 1976, Morocco claimed the territory, based on longstanding ties with the tribes of the territory, shared religion, and language. Moreover, previous agreements with Spain, Great Britain, and the US further work as a proof of their legitimate ruling over the region. Other foundations for their claim were treaties with Spain, Great Britain and the US.
The International Court of Justice declared on 16thOctober1976that the present territory of Western Sahara is the “foundation of a Saharan people with its own well-defined character, made up of autonomous tribes, independent of any external authority”. On November 1975, the Green March took place. 350 000 volunteers occupied the region, leading to an escalation of conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, backed by Algeria. The war lasted until 1991, when aUN ceasefiredeclare the ending. Yet, during the conflict, Morocco took control over most of the territory, and maintained it by incentivizing settlements and building infrastructures.
Overall, Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara is driven byeconomic factors. The territory is rich in phosphates, fish stocks, oil, and gas reserves. By 2018,94%of the catches exported to the EU (in accordance with the agreement) came from Western Sahara’s waters. Moreover, the infiltration of Morocco within the region may represent a transversal control over the region, and, especially, its natural resources. Therefore, agreements with the EU have effects that are not confined solely within the economic sphere.
The Polisario Front started its legal battle in November 2012. It pleaded against theEU Council Decision 2012/497/EU, the first version of the agreement on agricultural and fishery products with Morocco. The case bears similarities to their ongoing legal disputes with the EU. Without the proper involvement of the Sahrawi people in the agreements, the Council is violating International Law, namely the right to self-determination and the principle of obligations for third parties.
In December 2015, the General Court of Justice annulled the agreement. Along with it, based on the need to ensure human rights compliance, the ruling recognized the Polisario Front as the legal representative of the Sahrawi people. However, in December 2016, the CJEU overturned this decision. On the one hand, the Court acknowledged that EU-Morocco agreements could not legally apply to Western Sahara, being a separate non-self governing territory underUN Resolution 34/37.On the other, it ruled that the Polisario Frontlackedlegal standing in the case. The Polisario Front could not challenge the CJEU’s decision in court because it was not included in the agreements as an involved party.
To circumvent the 2016 ruling, the Council and Commission renegotiated the agreements in2019. This time, they confirmed the proper participation of the Sahrawi people during the consultation process. However, the Polisario Front argued that these consultations were neither representative nor legitimate. In2021, the General Court again ruled in favour of the Western Sahara territory, stating that the EU had failed to obtain the explicit concent of the Saharawi people. Indeed, the consultations took place with the current inhabitants of the territory,  not specifically with peoplebelongingto Western Sahara. Appealed by the Council and the Commission, we arrive at the final CJEU ruling in October2024.
The annulment is a symbolic victory for Western Sahara. For years, the Council and the Commission prioritized economic benefits over the Saharawi people’s right to self-determination. This stance on the agreements was further reinforced by Morocco’s use of migration asleverageto pressure EU policy changes.
Nonetheless, the Grand Chamber ruling also set theminimum conditionsfor third-party consent under International Law. Indeed, if the people of non-self governing territories “receive a specific, tangible, substantial, and verifiable benefit from the exploitation of the territory,” along with the guarantee of the region’s sustainable development, and “regular control mechanisms” to verify that these benefits are actually perceived,  the agreements would be compatible with International Law. Therefore, as long as economic benefits are guaranteed, further compliance of the representative of the Western Sahara’s people is not required. The consequences could lead to increased legitimization of Morocco’s claim of the territory, through the presence of private companies.
On the other hand, the annulment is expected to have harsh economic consequences on Morocco. Besides losing 40 millions per years in European funds, agricultural exports from Western Sahara will loseprefential accessto the EU markets. Moreover, further implications to other bilateral agreements can potentially reduce Western Sahara’s economic appeal for Rabat.
Compared to the past, Morocco’s reaction was quite different. In 2016, after the 2015 CEJU ruling, the Kingdomsuspendend diplomatic relationswith the EU. Whereas, back to these days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to not be threatened by the decision. He declared that the Kingdomwas not consultedduring the proceedings. Moreover, Rabat reiterated that it would only comply with further agreements, only if they respect its territorial integrity and national unity.
The dispute occurred while the Polisario Front faced diminishing recognition. In 2020, Morocconormalisedrelations with Israel, via the mediation of Donald. J. Trump. The historic agreement comes with theofficial recognitionof Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara by the United States. In 2023, Israel followed suit, becomingthe second countryto recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.
In 2022, Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, formallyannouncedSpain’s support of theMoroccan initiatives for autonomyproposed in 2007. The Autonomy Plan recognised Western Sahara as an autonomous region, but under the Kingdom of Morocco. Emmanuel Macron shared thesame positionin 2024, during a visit to Morocco. This affirmation in parliament did not come without consequences from Algeria, whichwithdrew its ambassadorsfrom Paris.
The CJEU ruling represents a legal but partial victory for the Sahrawi People. Given shifting geopolitical alliances, the chances of Western Sahara’s universal recognition as a separate entity are narrowing. Moreover, EU institutions appear fragmented. While the Commission and the Council seek to maintain friendly ties with Morocco, the kingdom leverages Europe’s growing interests and needs –anti-migration and energy supply– to advance its claim of sovereignty over Western Sahara. In this landscape, the CJEU remains the only EU body consistently siding with the Saharawi people.","June 16, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-european-court-of-justice-verdict-in-a-time-of-realignment/,Anna Milano,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
"Öcalan Calls, PKK and Turkish Government Pick Up: Is a New Peace Process on the Line?","“Let’s lay down arms and talk.”
This was the central message of aletter from Abdullah Öcalan, delivered and read aloud by members of the Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) at a conference in late February. Addressed primarily to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – the armed group that has led the Kurdish struggle for autonomy since the 1980s – the letter took both Kurds and Turks by surprise.
Although Öcalan –held in isolation on İmralı Island since 1999– has called for peace in the past, this message felt different. For the first time, he not only reaffirmed his commitment to a democratic resolution but also urged the PKK to take a bold and irreversible step: to disband entirely.
The letter reverberated across Türkiye’s political landscape, igniting cautious hope. Politicians from all sides – government officials and opposition alike –welcomed it as a rare and meaningful opportunity for dialogue after nearly a decade of deadlock, violence, and silence.
With the PKK’s dissolution now officially confirmed, hopes for reconciliation are gaining renewed momentum. In this context, one important question arises: could this mark the beginning of a new era for Turks and Kurds?
Present-day relations between Turks and Kurds have been shaped by a long and complex history. Once coexisting within the Ottoman Empire, the two communities began to diverge following the Eternal State’s collapse and the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923. As the newly established state prioritised the construction of a unified national identity, it implemented policies of cultural assimilation and the suppression of non-Turkish identities –including that of the Kurds.
These measures curtailed expressions of Kurdish heritage and representation, prompting waves of resistance – each met with heavy-handed state responses. As a result, what was once coexistence gradually turned into marginalisation, mistrust and unrest.
It was in this context that the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) was founded in 1978 by Abdullah Öcalan, then a student from the Şanlıurfa province. Originally a Marxist-Leninist movement advocating Kurdish independence, the PKK shifted its strategy under increasing state pressure. After relocating its leadership to Syria and Lebanon, the group launched a guerrilla insurgency in 1984 –initiating a conflict that would last for decades.
Since its inception, the conflict has claimed over 40,000 lives, displaced hundreds of thousands, and left a profound mark on both Turkish and Kurdish communities. Yet despite escalating violence and a growing human toll, there have been moments when peace seemed within reach.
The first significant opening camein the early 1990s, when President Turgut Özal initiated secret talks with Öcalan, mediated by Iraqi Kurdish leaders Jalal Talabani and Masoud Barzani. The proclamation of a unilateral ceasefire from the PKK in 1993 raised hopes among both Turks and Kurds. However, Özal’s sudden death that same year abruptly halted the process, andhostilities resumed. Further efforts in 1995 and 1999 also failed to produce lasting results.
The most promising attempt occurredbetween 2012 and 2015, when Erdoğan’s government entered direct negotiations with Öcalan. These talks led to a ceasefire and the withdrawal of PKK fighters from Turkish territory, sparking hopes for a durable peace and expanded rights for Kurds. Yet this progress proved short-lived. The fragile progress collapsed amid domestic tensions and regional upheaval – especially the Syrian Civil War and the rise of ISIS. Ankara accused the PKK ofbacking the Syrian Kurdish YPG’s bid for autonomy in Rojava– viewing it as a national security threat. In turn, the PKK accused the Turkish government ofsupporting jihadist groupsto undermine Kurdish influence.
This mutual distrust once again cast the process into violence and silence.
Öcalan’s recent letter now marks what could be an important turning point. His unprecedented call for the PKK to disband has been cautiously welcomed by both Turkish authorities and senior PKK figures. Encouraging signals from Ankara – coupled with confirmation thatthe PKK has agreed to comply with its leader’s directives– suggest a rare moment of alignment and a genuine opening for progress.
But it is not only these developments that indicate this initiative might have a better chance of success than previous efforts. Several geopolitical and domestic factors support this possibility.
First, shifting regional dynamics have weakened the PKK’s strategic position.Strengthened tiesbetween Türkiye and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq have gradually reduced the PKK’s foothold in the region. Meanwhile,political changes in Syria– including the collapse of the Assad regime, the emergence of a more pro-Turkish government, and the YPG’s recent alignment with the latter – have further isolated the PKK. These developments have significantly narrowed its operational capacity and diplomatic leverage, making negotiations with the Turkish government almost inevitable.
Second, Türkiye’s domestic political landscape is evolving. President Erdoğan and the ruling AKP aregrappling with economic stagnation and declining electoral support,as evidenced by recent polls. With early elections on the horizon, a breakthrough on the Kurdish issue could serve as a political lifeline – helping Erdoğan reconnect with conservative Kurdish voters while also appealing to centrist constituencies.
Among the most unexpected developments is the involvement of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), led by Devlet Bahçeli. Long regarded as one of the most hardline forces in Turkish politics, theMHP’s participation signals a potential strategic shift– one that could profoundly impact the peace process.
Several factors might explain this recalibration. The MHP could be seeking to reposition itself closer to the political center ahead of elections, broadening its appeal beyond its traditional base. It might also aim to shape the process from within – ensuring that any reconciliation aligns with the principle of state sovereignty. By joining the dialogue, the MHP positions itself as a gatekeeper, potentially preventing both domestic rivals and foreign actors from dominating the narrative.
Its involvement is therefore both symbolic and substantive. It signals that even traditionally nationalist actors now recognise the high stakes – and perhaps the necessity – of dialogue. Yet it also raises important questions: is the MHP genuinely willing to support a peace framework that includes recognition of Kurdish identity and rights, or is its participation more about containment than transformation?
Whatever the rationale, the MHP’s engagement increases both the complexity and the potential of the process.
International involvement, as seen in past peace processes in other regions, could prove essential to sustaining this fragile opportunity. The European Union –which has supported previous peace efforts– might provide a neutral platform for dialogue. Likewise, the United States –which has previously backed the peace efforts– could help sustain progress and avert derailments through its influence and relations with both Türkiye and Kurdish forces in the region.
Coordinated international engagement might help transform this moment into a lasting resolution – especially if it reinforces commitments to international law and democratic reform.
While the PKK’s dissolution is a momentous step, peace cannot rest on disarmament alone. True reconciliation will require structural reforms and a shift in political culture.
For many Kurds, this is not the end of their struggle – but the beginning of a new chapter focused on dignity, recognition, and meaningful participation. Kurdish citizens continue toseek acknowledgment of their language, identity, and political rights. Over the years, peaceful Kurdish activism has often been criminalised under Türkiye’s broad anti-terrorism laws. Thousands remain imprisoned – including prominent former HDP leader Selahattin Demirtaş.
Even ethnic Turkish politicians – such as Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu – have faced legal threats for merely advocating Kurdish inclusion and dialogue. This highlights the bigger challenge that Türkiye must face: transitioning from a securitised state model to an inclusive democracy.
If this moment is to become a real turning point, Türkiye must adopt a vision of peace that goes beyond symbolism and embraces real, systemic change. This means enacting legal protections for minority rights, ending the misuse of terrorism laws to silence dissent, and building inclusive institutions founded on trust.
Lasting peace will only be possible when Kurdish identity and political participation are recognised as vital expressions of the nation’s democratic character – not as threats. Justice must be impartial, and reconciliation must be based on mutual respect – not silence or submission.
Though the path ahead remains challenging, recent developments have opened a genuine window of opportunity for peace – one unseen in many years. With the first steps toward reconciliation already taken, the key question remains: are all parties ready to seize this chance?
Only time will tell.

"Today Ukraine, Tomorrow Taiwan? Trump 2.0 and Taiwan’s Bargaining “CHIP”?","President Donald J. Trump addressing the US Congress after the start of his second mandate in 2025. (Source: Public Domain)
As Trump returns to the White House in 2025, the world watches how his second term will reshape U.S. foreign policy. Earlier in February, aproposed minerals dealbetween Ukraine and the U.S. made headlines. The deal, intended to allocate a portion of revenues from Ukraine’s state-owned natural resources to the U.S. in exchange for continued American support, collapsed following a heated White House meeting. The mineral deal has ignited global debate and raised concerns among U.S. allies.
Now, with growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait,concernsmount over whether Taiwan could face a similar transactional demand. If security guarantees come with a price tag, what might Washington demand from Taipei in the event of a conflict with China? Could Taiwan’s semiconductor dominance be its ultimate bargaining chip for U.S. support?
It is no secret that Trump has long embraced ahighly transactional and money-first approachto foreign policy. A pattern that was evident throughout his first term and has continued into his second. He has often framed alliances and diplomatic relationships in terms of material value. Viewing U.S. commitments as strategic partnerships and deals to be negotiated for tangible returns. The recent mineral trade deal discussed during his meeting with Zelensky in February exemplifies this mindset, tying U.S. security assistance to access to Ukraine’s state-owned natural resources. When Ukraine did not accept the terms of the agreement, the U.S. responded bypostponing military aid and intelligence sharing. A bold move that undermines the perceived reliability of U.S. commitments.
While foreign policy inherently involves negotiation and bargaining. Trump’s approach often treats alliances as business transactions, where support is contingent on direct material exchange. His remark during negotiations with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy—suggesting that Ukraine“has no card to play to end the conflict”—further underscores this outlook.
Trump’s handling of the Ukraine minerals deal has raised alarms among U.S. allies, with Taiwan feeling particularly vulnerable. The island’s most valuable geopolitical asset—its semiconductor industry—has long been viewed as a critical bargaining chip for U.S. security guarantees. Often referred to as Taiwan’s “silicon shield,” TSMC’s dominance in advanced chip manufacturing is central to both the island’s economic stability and national security.
Just days after the heated U.S.-Ukraine meeting on February 28, TSMC unexpectedly announced a$100 billion investmentto expand its Arizona operations. The deal includes two advanced packaging facilities, three semiconductor foundries, and a research center—one of the company’s largest overseas commitments, after Taiwan’s January decision tolift restrictions on foreign chip production.
For years till January, Taiwan restricted its most advanced semiconductor production to maintain its technological edge. TSMC was only allowed to manufacture overseas chips at least one generation behind those made domestically. For example, it could not produce 2nm chips in the U.S. until Taiwan had already moved on to A-16 chips, projected for mass production in late 2026. Even as TSMC expanded toJapanandGermany, those plants were limited to larger, less advanced nodes tosafeguard Taiwan’s leadership in cutting-edge chipmaking.
Now, with restrictions lifted and a major U.S. expansion underway, concerns are mounting in Taiwan. While the investment aligns with Trump’s push forsemiconductor self-sufficiency, it raises questions about whether Taiwan is gradually losing its leverage in the U.S.-Taiwan security dynamic.
TSMC, as a private enterprise, has the freedom to make strategic business decisions. However, given its pivotal role in both Taiwan’s economy and national security, its overseas expansion inevitably carries broader geopolitical implications.
Eroding Taiwan’s Strategic Leverage?
Critics argue TSMC’s expansion in the U.S. risks Taiwan’s strategic leverage by transferring key semiconductor technology that was previously safeguarded within domestic production. This “protectionism” ensures Taiwan’s semiconductor industry remains an indispensable asset in global supply chains.
Concernsgrow that the U.S. may gradually reduce its dependence on Taiwan. This fear is compounded by Trump’s past rhetoric, as during his 2024 campaign, he accused TSMC of“stealing”the U.S. chip industry.
After the announcement of the investment plan, in an interview withFULLMEASURE, Trump unilaterally claimed that TSMC’s investment would increase to$200 billion—without any official confirmation from the company, and even declared, “Forget about chips from Taiwan.” Such statements have only intensified fears that the U.S. is seeking to diminish Taiwan’s strategic importance.
If Washington becomes self-sufficient, would Taiwan’s semiconductor dominance still hold value as a bargaining chip? In the event of a conflict with China, would Trump, with his transactional foreign policy mindset, be less inclined to defend Taiwan if its strategic importance in the semiconductor supply chain diminishes?
Without  U.S.’ security guarantees or commitments, there’s no shield.Janson Hsu, former Taiwan legislator & senior fellow on tech policy at Hudson Institute.
Securing Taiwan Strategic Value: A Necessary Step
Supporters argue Taiwan should not be overly concerned about the deal. The deal is an “insurance policy” for Taiwan’s security—an approachwelcomedby Trump. For TSMC, establishing production in the U.S. offers practical business benefits, such as avoiding the risk of tariffs that Trump has frequently threatened to impose on Taiwan-made chips. Furthermore, from a technological perspective, collaboration with the U.S. could fosterinnovation, allowing TSMC to leverage U.S. expertise in chip design, thereby strengthening Taiwan’s position in the semiconductor supply chain.
Impossible for U.S. to give up Indo Pacific, it’s in the U.S.’ national interest.Wellington Koo, Minister of National Defense.
Building on these benefits, Taiwan remains a crucial strategic asset for the U.S.,Kooreassured Taiwan’s security and geopolitical significance in the media briefing after the announcement.
Positioned at thecenterof the first island chain, Taiwan is a key point for countering any potential Chinese invasion. Protecting Taiwan is vital for U.S. national security and the interests of neighboring U.S. allies. Therefore, Taiwan remains a core interest for the U.S. and will not easily be abandoned. Taiwan, like other U.S. allies, needs andagreesto increase its military spending. The U.S. is unlikely to treat Taiwan in the same way it approaches Ukraine. Given Taiwan’s strategic importance in the broader security framework of the Indo-Pacific region.
Beyond geopolitical concerns, TSMC’s U.S. expansion raisespractical challenges. Higher labor costs could put the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its cost-efficient operations in Taiwan.
Cultural differencesin work ethics also pose hurdles—Taiwan’s workforce is known for its efficiency and dedication, often working long hours to meet production demands. In contrast, U.S. labor laws and workplace norms may not align as seamlessly with TSMC’s high-intensity approach. This friction has already led tolawsuitsalleging “anti-American discrimination” at the company. If not managed carefully, these operational challenges could undermine the efficiency that has long defined TSMC’s significance in the supply chain.
While Taiwanese authorities havedownplayed concerns, insisting that TSMC’s expansion is purely a business decision. Claiming it is a win-win for U.S.- Taiwan- TSMC. Yet the move inevitably signals a deeper shift in Taiwan’s strategic position. Is this a win-win scenario, or will Taiwan ultimately bear the costs? As tensions in the Taiwan Strait continue to escalate, the key question remains: will Taiwan’s semiconductor industry continue to serve as a protective ‘silicon shield,’ or is it at risk of becoming a mere bargaining chip in U.S. foreign policy?

The first Year of Milei’s Foreign Policy,"This article examines the first year of the foreign policy of Javier Milei’s government. A dramatic shift has become evident in Argentinian foreign policy in the last months, mostly marked by a deep alignment with the USA. This stands in contrast to previous Argentine governments, such as the Kirchner (2003-2015) and Fernandez (2019-2023) administrations, which had a regional, sovereigntist, and “Global South”vision, and the MauricioMacri government (2015-2019),which pursued an “apertura al mundo” (Openness to the world in English) approach through the fostering of closer ties with multilateral organizations and the EU.
Furthermore, a crucial change has been observed regarding Argentina’s historically principled attitude of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Historically,the country has maintained a position of neutrality, advocating for the peaceful resolution of conflicts. This has been based on the principle of the sovereign equality of states. Some key examples of this approach include theDrago Doctrine (1902),the Saavedra Lamas Doctrine (1933)andArgentina’s resistanceto USA pressure to enter World War II. Nevertheless, Milei seems determined to break with some of these traditions, although it remains uncertain whether Milei’s government has so far acted based on its ideological convictions or taken a more pragmatic approach. The following paragraphs will explain this in detail.
1-Personalism: a style of conducting foreign policy
Javier Milei appears to extend his disruptive style to the international scenario, often prioritizing his “fight against the woke agenda” over Argentina’s traditional diplomatic practices. Inhis opening speech at the 79th UN General Assembly, President Milei not only confronted multilateralism, the UN, and the 2030 Agenda but also declared that Argentina will abandon its position of neutrality to take a leading role in the fight for freedom. Moreover, this switch in Argentina’s foreign policy has taken a highly personalist approach, as Milei positioned himself as the leader of the aforementioned fight against the “progressive” agenda which includes gender and climate change policies.
The strongest evidence of this political personalism can be found in the18 international tripsthat President Milei has done in his first year in office, surpassing his recent predecessors Mauricio Macri (13) and Alberto Fernández (3) over the same period. Many of these have been aimed at leading the “cultural battle” as an international figure, such as Milei’s visits to theConservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)in 2025.
2- International alliances
Mileihas made it clearfrom the first day: his strategic allies would be the USA and Israel. In fact, Argentina’s international policy has aligned so closely with the USA that, Diana Mondino (former External Affairs Minister)was removed in October 2024from her position for ideological disobedience following her vote in favour of lifting the embargo on Cuba.
Regarding National Security, this change is also evident. The decision toacquire F-16 Falconsreflects this alignment, prioritizing the US over the Chinese alternative and making a geopolitical choice. As is also described in the article “What’s Going On in Argentine Intelligence?”, several bilateral meetings have taken place between high-ranking officials from diverse security agencies, giving evidence of this approach.
Furthermore,the closeness to the USA became more evident with Donald Trump’s electoral victory. Mileibecame the first foreign leaderto meet with Trump after his victory. But Milei’s foreign policy plan was not only marked by his alliance with Trump but also by his approach to Elon Musk. This move aims to show himself as the leader of the already mentioned cultural battle and to increase connections with the private sector, promoting potential investments in Argentina.
Milei’s policy on Israel also demonstrates the abandonment of neutrality. This marks a fracture from Argentina’s traditional political posture, as evidenced by itsvoteagainst recognizing Palestine as a UN member state and itsrefusal to support a UN resolutioncalling for an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.
Besides, from a symbolic point of view, Milei has found in Nicolás Maduro, current Venezuela’s president, an ideal antagonist. The peak of tensions between the two administrations happened after the results of Venezuela’s election.Argentina did not recognize the result and denounced fraud, escalating the conflict to its highest point when Venezuela expelled Argentine diplomatic staff from its territory.
Last but not least, the ideological break with the Global South is evident inArgentina’s decision to withdraw from joining BRICS, a process initiated by the previous Fernández administration.
3-Pragmatism
There are also aspects of Milei’s international approach that could suggest a predominance of pragmatism over the principles that define his ideology. This is not unusual, as most governments tend to balance their foreign policy between ideological elements and pragmatic considerations.
For example, with Brazil, one of Argentina’s main regional partners, there have been tensions regarding the personal relationship between Milei and Lula. These tensions began withLula’s open support for Sergio Massa, Milei’s2023presidential opponent, and escalated withMilei’s calling Lula a “corrupt communist.”From a diplomatic perspective, the cold relationship was also evident in theunfriendly exchangesbetween them during the G20 summit in Rio.
However, pragmatism has also played a role in Argentina-Brazil relations. In November 2024, both countriesagreed to investigatethe development of infrastructure for Argentina’s natural gas exports to Brazil. Other examples include cooperation in emergency situations, such as Argentina sending humanitarian aid (including an aircraft, three helicopters, two water purification plants, and personnel) to Brazil in May 2024 during the floods in Rio Grande do Sul. Additionally,Brazil took over Argentina’s diplomatic representation in Caracasafter Maduro’s ultimatum to kick out Argentine diplomatic staff.
Pragmatism was also evident in Argentina’s relationship with China. During his presidential campaign, Milei had said that he would not “do business” with a communist country. However, after a pragmatic move in relation to the Asian giant, Milei’s governmentrecognized the “One China” principle.  Additionally, during a television interview, Mileieven emphasizedthat China is “a very interesting trade partner. They don’t demand anything; the only thing they ask is not to be bothered”. Another clear evidence of pragmatism in this relationship is therenewal of the currency swap agreementin June 2024.
4-Malvinas islandsand Mercosur
Regarding Argentina’s claim over the Malvinas islands, President Mileihas frequently statedthe country’s aspiration to recover sovereignty over the territory. However, in October 2024,a statement from Argentina’s Ministry of Defenselabelled the archipelago as “Falklands” instead of “Malvinas.” This event added to other controversies, such as Milei’s admiration for Margaret Thatcher, the British PM during the Malvinas War (1982).
In relation to Mercosur, Milei’s policy also signals a break from the past. The priority currently appears to be free trade agreements, particularly with the USA. And since such agreements must be negotiated within the block, the possibility that Mercosur could mean an obstacle,has led Milei to viewthe regional alliance unfavourably.
Final thoughts
It can be observed that, beyond the shift in foreign policy, something that is natural when administrations change, there are some significant points:

European Affairs: Slovakia’s Culture under the Fico Government,"In October 2023, formerSlovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who resigned in 2018, won in a parliamentary election and was re-elected as Prime Minister. Fico was the political leader of Smer-SD, a left-wing populist and nationalist political party with “social democratic” values. Smer created a coalition with Hlas-SD and the Slovak National Party (SNS). Hlas-SD is a social democratic party that works toward traditional goals within the welfare state but takes a more conservative position on social issues. SNS is a right-wing social conservative party that holds ultranationalist views. In the months following the election, the Fico government ‘cut off‘ communication with multiple media outlets, signaling the beginning of their suppression of the media.
The suppression of media also comes after the alterationof Radio and Television Slovakia (RTVS), Slovakia’s public broadcaster. The Fico governmentpassed the Act on Slovak Television and Radio, renaming the broadcaster the Slovak Television and Radio(STVR) and placing it under the control of the government. Slovakian media also shiftedback to communicating with Russia. Previously, Slovakia had halted interaction with Russia after they invadedUkraine in 2022.
Slovakia and Jan Kuciak
The suppression of journalists and mediaechoes the concernsthat existed in Slovakia in 2018. In February 2018,Jan Kuciakwas an investigative journalist who had been researching potential corruption that spread across the governments of the European Union. He and his fiancée were both killed because of his work, which triggered large-scale protests across Europe. The unrest led to theresignation of parts of Slovakia’s governmentduring the period, including the then-Prime Minister, Robert Fico.
The ousting of Prime Minister Fico in 2018 illustrates his current motivation to dismantle journalists’ outputs and broadcast news. Presently, his government has ‘disbanded the Special Prosecutor’s Office‘ creating further difficulty to protect journalists as there aren’t governmental organs for their security. The alteration of the RTVS has ‘potentially [compromised] its editorial independence‘ as its board is made up of political appointees rather than experts. Further changes to media freedom in Slovakia have caused less legal protection for journalists and increased violence.

The Culture Minister and Artistic Freedom
Fico appointed a member from SNS named Martina Šimkovičová, as the Minister of Culture. Šimkovičová, a former media personality, had previously been relieved of her position after posting hateful statements targeting Syrian refugees. She continues tospout hateful commentstargeted at the LGBTI+ community under the guise of protecting traditional Slovakian culture. Her speaking points are then implemented within the policies of the ministry. The result is theexclusion of art created by persons in the LGBTI+ community, such as the ending of funds to an annual festival calledDrama Queer. These political movements by Šimkovičová are illustrations of homophobia and transphobia being expressed by Fico’s government.
The actions by the Minister of Culture have been aimed at the dismantling of key cultural institutions. This is done by holding funding from art and education programs, which then stops the production of events and art.Kunsthalle Bratislava is a primary exampleof this action by Šimkovičová. Kunsthalle Bratislava is a historic institution of art that was established in 1958, where an ‘inclusive communal space’ can be cultivated with consistent collaboration as there is no permanent exhibition. However, the Culture Ministry revoked funding as Kunsthalle Bratislava was a consistent collaborator with the LGBTI+ community. Šimkovičová expressed that the “parasitizing” of money by the LGBTI+ community would end. This statement and actions are consistent with her rejection and attack on the expression of marginalized communities. However, she frames her policies as an appeal to a return to national identity. The defunding of Kunsthalle Bratislava led to the resignation of the director, Jen Kratocvhil. The halls management was passed to the Slovak National Gallery. Other institutions, including those within the Ministry of Culture, such as the Institute of Cultural Policy, were completely closed under the guise of saving money.
The cultural institutions of Slovakia are also being hollowed out through the removal of professional staff who are replaced with political appointments. The independence of these institutions is integral for artistic freedom in Slovakia, as art is a cross-cultural medium. Yet, Šimkovičová and her ministry expressed that “Slovak culture must be Slovak and nothing else.” Xenophobic positions like this have contributed to a string of dismissals, such as the removal of the head of the children’s art gallery called Bibiana, or the replacement of leadership at the Slovak National Gallery. The National Gallery serves as one of the most important cultural institutions in the country. Since the appointment of Šimkovičová, it has undergone numerous leadership changes, beginning with Alexandra Kusá’s dismissal. The appointment of Jaroslav Niňaj brought about calls from over a hundred employees threatening to quit. This employee dissent is sourced from the ‘hostile work environment…” full of intimidation threats, and investigations”‘. The protests and collective movement against the appointment of Niňaj have had external effects, where somenon-governmental funders are pausing their commitments.
Art-Funding
The Fico Government has also altered legislation, where more control is given to the government to fund art. This is through the amendment to the Act on the Fund for the Support of Art. More changes have come about through the increasing of members on the board brought about by appointments from the Minister of Culture. In the past,the  expert commission would research projects and recommend an allocation of funds that the director would need to approve. Now, the board has final say. These actions have led to expert knowledge on arts and culture being devalued and dismissed. Artists and cultural institutions are currently in a state of unease as there is an absence of stability. Questions of funding and secure positions are prevalent throughout the artistic scene in Slovakia. Self-censorship has also become prevalent amongst artists because of the discrimination against those that are not conform toŠimkovičová’s calls to return to normal.
There is an opposition by Open Culture! fighting against the regressive actions of Šimkovičová and Fico’s government. Open Culture! started the “Culture Strike” in September of 2024, working towards ‘three…demands: good governance, fair payment, and an end to political censorship’. The strike is taking the form of ‘large demonstrations’ or ‘various performances’. Open Culture! stated that ‘the collective turning of backs on the current director of the Slovak National Gallery’ resonated well with their work to fight against repression. Their work has also included creating ‘reports on the failures of the Ministry of Culture’. The work being done by Open Culture! and the Culture Strike continues in 2025.

A Coup Foretold: Brazil Confronts the Depths of a Plot to Kill Lula,"In November 2024, Brazil’s Federal Police made public what had long lingered as speculation:a military plot to assassinate President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvaand Vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin before their 2023 inauguration. The operation—known asPunhal Verde e Amarelo(‘Green and Yellow Dagger’)—wasdeveloped within the upper echelons of Jair Bolsonaro’s government and allegedly involved the murder of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the imposition of a military junta, and the annulment of the electoral result.A failed insurrection on 8 January 2023, until then seen as the climax of Bolsonarismo’s challenge to democracy, was perhaps only the visible tip of a darker design.
The main suspect,retired Brigadier General Mário Fernandes, had occupied a key executive role in Bolsonaro’s cabinet. In November 2022, Fernandes reportedly printed a copy of the assassination plan from inside the Palácio do Planalto. It detailed an operation planned for December 15—three days after Lula’s official certification as winner of the presidential election. The document proposed the killing of Lula, Alckmin, and Moraes via gunshot or poison. In the event of success, retired generals Braga Netto and Augusto Heleno—both former ministers—would assume command of the country and install a transitional regime. The aim was to “restore order” and hold new elections under military oversight.
Among the suspects arrested or investigated are several officers with Special Forces training, as well as close advisers to Bolsonaro. While the military has downplayed the arrests, asserting that the officers were not involved in G20 security in Rio de Janeiro where some were apprehended, their former proximity to the presidency is uncontested.
The seeds of the plot appear to have been sown months earlier. A Federal Police investigation revealed that in July 2022,a high-level meeting was held within Bolsonaro’s circleto discuss the logistics of agolpe de Estado. A video recording of this meeting was found on the computer of Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro’s aide-de-camp and former lieutenant colonel. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, now presiding over the investigation at the STF, described the footage as evidence of “a coup dynamic arranged at the highest levels of government.”
Two weeks after the meeting, Bolsonaro invited foreign ambassadors to the Palácio da Alvorada andpublicly questioned the integrity of Brazil’s voting system. According to prosecutors, this served to “verbalise” previously discredited fraud claims, aiming to sow doubt among Brazil’s international allies and domestic audience alike.
Following his defeat to Lula in the October 2022 runoff, Bolsonaro went silent. He avoided public appearances, skipped his Thursday livestreams, andeventually fled to Florida, leaving the presidency without formally acknowledging the result. His departure came just days before Lula’s inauguration.
Meanwhile,Bolsonaristas set up encampments outside army barracks, calling for military intervention. On December 12—the day Lula’s election was formally certified—rioters attempted to storm the Federal Police headquarters in Brasília, torching vehicles and clashing with security forces. It was, in hindsight, a dress rehearsal for what would unfold on January 8.
In the aftermath of the failed insurrection, thousands were arrested. Many have since been released, but over 200 people have already been sentenced by the Supreme Court for their role in what the judiciary now refers to as an attempted coup. Among them were demonstrators, financiers, and organisers. Some cases sparked debate over due process, but the broader response from the courts has been unambiguous in that there will be no amnesty.
The central question regarding Bolsonaro’s rolehas moved from implication to formal accusation. In June 2023, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE)barred him from holding office until 2030for abuse of power and misuse of public channels during the ambassadors’ meeting. By November 2024, federal police formally indicted the former president in the attempted coup probe. And in February 2025, the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGR) followed suit, filing charges with the Supreme Court based on an 884-page investigation.
The STF will begin reviewing whether to accept thecharges against Bolsonaro and seven other defendants. The case will hinge on the strength of the evidence gathered by the Federal Police, which includes documents, witness statements, and digital communications. But the political implications are already evident: Brazil may see a former president tried not only for undermining democracy but for conspiring to murder the man who succeeded him.
In Brazil, the judicialisation of politics is nothing new. But the current cycle has torn through old assumptions. Bolsonaro is not just being accused of constitutional overreach or disinformation. He now stands at the center of an alleged conspiracy to forcibly reverse an election result through a military takeover. The scope is unprecedented in the country’s recent history.
Justice Moraes, who presides over many of the related inquiries, remains both praised and vilified: seen by some as the last line of defence against authoritarianism and by others as the architect of a judiciary that’s overstepped its democratic bounds. His name, like Lula’s, sits at the heart of this confrontation. Whether Brazil emerges from this chapter with stronger democratic guardrails remains uncertain.","April 04, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/a-coup-foretold-brazil-confronts-the-depths-of-a-plot-to-kill-lula/,Fabiano G.

From tariffs to trade wars: How U.S. politics challenges EU agreements,"President Donald J. Trump meets with the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen during the 50th Annual World Economic Forum meetingSource:The White House from Washington, DC
Since Donald Trump assumed office as the 47th president of the United States in January, uncertainty has loomed over international trade. Global stock markets have struggled to find a stable footing, while nations grapple with shifting alliances, unsure who remains an ally and who has become an enemy.
The European Union, which looks to be at the centre of the new executive branch’s dartboard, is no stranger to this situation. It is becoming less and less aligned with Washington, but it cannot ignore the importance of the United States as a strategic partner. They share the world’s largest bilateral trade and investment relationship and form the most integrated economic partnership globally. The European Union and the United States are each other’s largest trading partners (European Commission, 2025).
​In 2023, the United States was the second-largest supplier of goods to the European Union, following China. Total bilateral trade in goods between the European Union and the United States reached €851 billion. EU exports to the U.S. amounted to €503 billion, while imports from the U.S. totaled €347 billion, leaving the EU with a trade surplus of €157 billion in goods. The picture is different regarding the trade of services; in 2023, total trade in services between the EU and the U.S. reached €746 billion. The EU exported €319 billion in services to the U.S. and imported €427 billion in return, leading to a trade deficit of €109 billion in services for the EU.
This trade imbalance underscores a relationship of mutual dependence between the two partners. However, President Trump has framed it as unfair treatment toward the United States. In his view, countries running trade surpluses are exploiting America’s openness to their advantage.
According to asurvey by the Pew Research Center, during the 2024 US Presidential elections, the economy topped the list of the most pressing concerns of US voters, while 54% of the voters expressed confidence in Donald Trump for handling the issue at hand better than Kamala Harris. One of the primary reasons for this view could be attributed to Trump’s nationalist and protectionist international trade strategies. One of his campaign promises dealt with“rebuilding the greatest economy in history”and providing the US citizens jobs by reshoring plans so that they are no longer dependent on China for manufacturing goods.  This was accompanied by Trump’s strategy of applying aggressive tariff measures to serve the dual purpose of gaining a footing in the international trade regime while protecting domestic manufacturers.
As mentioned previously, the EU enjoys a surplus in trade of goods with the US. In comparison to the 2023 data, EU exports increased by 5.5%, while imports declined by 4.0%, fuelling a sense of hostility towards the union. The Trump administration had previously accused the EU of taking undue advantage of its trade agreements. Before his second inauguration,he threatened the EUto reduce the trade surplus it maintained with the US by increasing US imports of oil and gas. The EU responded by stating that the trade surplus of the EU in goods was offset by a trade deficit in services.
In February, after assuming the presidency, keeping in view his policy, Trump hinted at a tariff increase “pretty soon” creating panic in the stock market. On March 12, Trump announced a blanket tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, which included the EU. On April 2, a 20% reciprocal tariff on all EU-imported goods was announced. Nevertheless, shortly after the public statement, the implementation of the tariffs was paused, providing a 90-day buffer for both parties to carry on talks and conduct negotiations. The baseline tax of 10% is, however, still applicable to all EU imports entering the US.
Impact on EU Trade
European companies have faced higher costs and supply chain disruptions, while key EU industries—such as automotive, agriculture, and technology—have been significantly affected by U.S. tariffs. These factors have contributed to growing uncertainty in transatlantic trade relations.
The theory of international trade suggests that with the imposition of a tariff, the imports become expensive for the Home country, benefiting Home producers, while the imports from the Foreign country decrease. Keeping this view in mind, it can be inferred that the direct effect would be reduced eurozone exports to the US.
As the demand for goods made in the EU reduces on account of higher prices in the US consumer market, domestic manufacturers in the US would be advantageous, while EU exporters will have to look for alternatives or narrow down their production. This could be accompanied by an economic downspiral. The main reason for Trump to apply these tariffs is to correct the trade imbalance with the EU, which could indeed lead to a current account deficit in the EU if the EU does not retaliate with counter-tariffs. Such a case can further contract consumption and investment, slowing growth.
The effects of the duties can vary regionally as well as sectorally. Among the leading economies, Germany, France, and Italy are deeply integrated with the US market, varying across sectors. In the automotive sector, tariffs could put 300,000 jobs at risk in Germany, the top exporter of automobiles in extra-EU trade.  Other countries such as Austria, Sweden, and the Visegrad countries, particularly Slovakia, would also be profoundly affected. According to the Vienna Institute for Economic Studies,  the short-term effects of a 25% duty resulting in an assumed 25% decline in exports would contract EU automotive exports by  0.14% and lead to a GDP reduction by 0.07%. The long-term effects would be reflected in declining real incomes and wages, most prominently in Slovakia by  0.1%, Ireland by 0.06%, and Hungary by 0.04%.
Another sector causing harm to both economies is the agricultural, food, and beverage industry. The proposed 20% taxes would discourage US importers from sourcing wine, spirits, beer, cheese, olive oil, fruits, and vegetables, etc. Within the industry, wine exporters are expected to be the worst affected, which (along with champagne and spirits) recentlyreceived a warning of a 200% tariffin March 2025. Marzia Varvaglione, president of the European Committee of Wine Companies (CEEV), expressed her concerns over the dire consequences of the tariffs on the EU’s wine trade, commenting on the absence of an alternative wine market.
The EU, being the largest supplier of luxury goods at 70%, including apparel, jewelry, leather items, watches, perfumes, and cosmetics, amounting to €288 billion in 2024, can also receive a severe blow. The shares of luxury companies LVMH(LVMH.PA) were down by 2% and Kering (PRTP.PA) by 31%, giving a pessimistic outlook for the consumers. The brands primarily located in France and Italy were counting on American consumption to counter the weak demand persisting in China. Brands such as Gucci, Cartier, and Chanel have already hiked their price by 3% to neutralise the effect of the duties, yet the customers may refrain from purchasing due toa global slowdown putting the industry at a standstill.
While the Trump administration has paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, the universal duties on steel and aluminium took effect on 12th March 2025. Previously, during the first Trump administration, the US and the EU engaged in a trade conflict affecting EU steel and aluminium as well as its derivative exports worth €6.4 billion (€8 billion in 2024  trade flow terms) and €40 million respectively before pausing any retaliatory measures until 31st March 2025. During this period, EU exports declined by more than a million tonnes. Now, the newly introduced 25% customs duty is estimated to affect EU exports worth €26 billion.
Moreover, since these restrictions are not limited to the EU but more than180 other countries, they can lead to an indirect effect on the EU’s internal market. The tariffs can force countries to redirect their products into the EU market, thus making it difficult for domestic producers to compete with the cheaper imports. For instance, theUS has levied a145 percent duty on Chinese imports, leaving analysts worried about China’s strategy to offload the excess. Many retailers are speculating that Chinese manufacturers will flood their products in the EU via platforms such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.
Taxes on car markers in Canada and Mexico, though paused for the time being, could exacerbate tightly interwoven supply chains with many EU Member States, including Germany, creating short-term inflationary effects, ultimately leading to rising unemployment levels.  The interconnectedness of these networks was witnessed by the immediate drop in Germany’s index (DAX) by 0.7%  and French automotive supplier Valeo (VLOF.PA) by 7.7% as April 2, the day of the announcement of tariffs, came closer. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell by 1.1%.
Besides, many top EU car manufacturers, including the Volkswagen group, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Stellantis, depend on Mexico for procuring components and setting production processes. The Audi division of the Volkswagen group makes the car modelsQ5 and Q5 Sportback at its  San José Chiapa. Since it does not fulfill the requirement of the 75% local content of the revised United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), they are liable to pay the 25% tax. This will significantly increase the cost of production and subsequently put a burden on the consumers in the form of price hikes.
The sudden surge in customs duties also questions the future of trade policies pursued by the EU. With the US turning towards import-substitution measures, the EU may follow in its footsteps. Given the threats of dumping by Chinese producers, it may urge the EU to impose protectionist policies on it.  On the contrary, it may encourage the EU to look for new avenues and diversify its export base. On a three-day visit to Vietnam, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, stressingthe importance of free trade, insisted that Europe look towards Southeast Asia for opening their markets for one another.
The European Union has reaffirmed its commitment to engaging with the United States through an open, collaborative, and constructive dialogue. This is illustrated by the travel of the EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič to hold meetings with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer (Euronews, April 11th, 2025). After weeks of deadlock, the Commission is hoping to advance negotiations on tariffs. In parallel to the negotiations, the EU continues to design countermeasures to the Trump administration’s new trade measures. In addition, Brussels is exercising “strategic patience”while, in light of recent developments, deepening ties with other global partners, including the Mercosur bloc, and potentially even China.
The European Union’s first line of defense is the Enforcement Regulation (Regulation 654/2014), which allows the bloc to impose so-calledrebalancing measuresin response to various trade disputes, including cases where a foreign country introduces safeguard measures to counter a sudden import surge. This was invoked when the first Trump administration imposed global 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs.
In addition, the European Commission could activate theanti-coercion instrument(ACI) (Regulation 2023/2675). It provides the EU with the means to deter and respond to economic coercion, and thereby better defend its interests and those of its Member States on the global stage. This instrument was adopted when the EU realised that it was difficult to respond quickly and effectively to tariff threats by the first Trump administration (Freshfields, April 8th, 2025). It gives the EU a wide range of possible countermeasures when a country refuses to remove the coercion.
The first European reaction was on 12th March 2025, where the Commission informed about the launch of two countermeasures against the steel and aluminium tariffs: the reimposition of the suspended 2018 and 2020 rebalancing measures; and the imposition of a new package of additional measures (European Commission, March 12th, 2025).
After the mandatory period of consultation, the President of the European Commission announced on April 3rd that a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel and aluminium imposed by Donald Trump on February 10th was already finalising (European Commission, April 3rd, 2025). These measures were announced on April 9th when EU Member States voted in favour of the European Commission’s proposal to introduce trade countermeasures against the United States. The duties will start being collected as of 15th April (European Commission, April 9th, 2025).
However, the list was trimmed after the EU executive, facing pressure from member states, backed down and removed bourbon, wine, and dairy products. The move followed President Trump’s threat to impose a 200% retaliatory tariff on European alcoholic beverages (Reuters, April 7th, 2025).
In addition to the tariffs on aluminium and steel, tariffs on automotive parts are expected on 3rd May 2025. The EU has yet to respond to Trump’s 25% tariff on cars or the forthcoming U.S. tariffs on pharmaceuticals. In the meantime, negotiations are there, and Europe has offered the U.S. “zero-for-zero” tariffs on cars and other industrial goods. The European bloc considers that this offer could be very beneficial for the American car industry.
These measures marked only the beginning of the storm. European retaliation extended beyond President Trump’s imposition of 20% “reciprocal” tariffs on all EU exports. When the so-called “Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs”  were announced, the European Union appeared poised and prepared. However, as of April 9th, those tariffs have been put on pause. President Trump announced a temporary suspension of tariffs above 10% for most U.S. trading partners (Politico, April 9th, 2025).
Still, the EU has made it clear: the toolbox is open, and with the unpredictability of the Trump administration, there’s little room for complacency. The measures announced so far are just the beginning; more remain on the table. Among them, the prospect of taxing large U.S. tech companies remains firmly under consideration (The Economist, April 9th, 2025).
Europe remains committed to diversifying its trade partnerships, engaging with countries that represent 87% of global trade and share its values of free and open exchange of goods, services, and ideas (European Commission, April 10th, 2025). But the key question remains:who could replace the United States as Europe’s primary partner?
Some European leaders advocate for distancing from Washington and strengthening ties with other global players. Others, however, argue that staying close to the U.S. remains essential (Politico, April 11st, 2025).
Latin America, and particularly the Mercosur countries, appears to be at the top of the EU’s list for trade diversification. The EU has been stepping up dialogue with the region for several years now, aiming to strengthen strategic autonomy and reduce dependency on traditional partners.
Over the past two years, the EU has updated its trade agreements with both Mexico and Chile. More notably, it has reached a majornew agreement with Mercosur. If ratified, the EU-Mercosur deal would establish a free trade area encompassing over 770 million people, representing a quarter of global GDP. The agreement is expected to significantly boost trade between the two regions, already closely linked economically. According to studies by the Bank of Spain, trade could increase by more than one-third in the long run.
While the agreement has faced considerable resistance, shifting global dynamics have changed the conversation. After the U.S. raised tariffs and intensified its trade war stance, countries like Finland and Sweden voiced their support for the EU-Mercosur deal, seeing it as a timely opportunity to reinforce global trade ties(AFP, April 8th, 2025).
Another notable case is the evolving relationship between the European Union and China.Could this be a classic enemies-to-lovers scenario?The EU and China have had trade disputes in the past over various products, such as electric vehicles. However, it suggests that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. United in adversity, there seems to be a willingness to strengthen ties between the two. The visit of Spain’s PM Pedro Sanchez, has helped to see this vision. Both consider that they have to jointly safeguard the trend of economic globalisation and a fair international trading environment, and jointly resist unilateral and intimidatory practices.
Sources report that EU leaders plan to meet Xi Jinping in China in July. The last such summit was held in Beijing in 2023 and, according to protocol, the next edition should be held in Brussels. The EU’s willingness to host China again suggests that European leaders are eager to please the Chinese president and use the summit, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of EU-China relations, to forge stronger ties with China (Politico, April 11th, 2025).
Recent events have shaken nations and heightened market insecurity. However, the European Union is making a virtue of necessity. Its traditional slow pace, bureaucracy, and requirement for consensus have paradoxically provided the stability and reliability so crucial amid the shifting sands the U.S. executive seems intent on stirring up.
“Old Europe” now has a chance to reject protectionism and position itself as the world’s leading advocate for free trade. As Ursula von der Leyen stated on April 3rd, “Europe has everything it needs to make it through this storm” (European Commission, April 3rd, 2025). But what exactly was she referring to? A strong legal framework? New trade partnerships? An unshakable calm and a commitment to negotiation?

(Human Story) American Scientists in Search of Safe Harbor,"The impact and reverberations of theTrump administration’s cuts to scientific fundingin the United States have not yet fully materialized, andmay well not be fully felt for some time to come. However, the immediate impact has been toelicit a chilling effect on the American scientific community, giving many scientistspause to reflect upon their options and future. Givenrecent overtures by European institutions in attracting American scientistsin light of the funding cuts, Marshall Everett and Sterling Rosen from TNGO’s EU Affairs division were able to interview an American scientist who is currently a PhD candidate in genetics, with a MSc in Molecular and Cellular Biology, on the condition of anonymity about the impact of these cuts and potential allure of institutions abroad such as those within the EU.
Yeah. So thank you both for having me and, agreeing to share my experiences. So I started, I started out wanting to do science based off several family members having health issues, specifically being impacted by cancer, and also rare genetic diseases. So this is kind of what led me on my path in undergrad and subsequently, after getting a degree in microbiology and Immunology. I worked at an immunotherapy company… where we worked on B-cell malignancies primarily. However, I didn’t really like the corporate lifestyle, so I went back to academia, and that’s where I got my master’s degree studying neurodevelopment toxicology… And so based off of that and some genetics, I’ve moved on to my PhD and I really wanted to focus, and join the lab that did cancer research, but also rare disease research. And so what we do here is we do cancer, but we also do, we’re starting to expand into rare disease research. And the reason why I’m doing this is I really just love the interdisciplinary nature of being in academia. And also I just want to dedicate my life to studying rare genetic diseases and how they can [be understood] when you study something so specific, how that can help broader disease application. So that’s kind of like the future dream is to run a lab that does that.
So I’ll start personally and then I’ll expand out to, our scientific community here. I personally, this is we were already seeing downward trends in funding, so funding was already getting difficult to get. But now it’s, really uncertain and almost impossible, because you don’t know if the fellowship you’re applying for, like, I just applied for an NIH fellowship. You don’t know if it will. like. Even if people dedicate time to reading your application, even if you’ll be considered for funding. It was already really hard. It was already like you had less than, like 5% chance of getting it. So now it’s like. Not like there’s no chance. And our PiS are having issues even funding their own labs. So it’s kind of, this basically, kind of just this loss of almost like, how do we get money? Private foundations are also closing down and not doing this and not wanting not able to fund science. And someone like me that wants to study like rare diseases. And then the broader implications, people don’t want to fund that. Even though those are definitely impacting people’s lives and are useful to science as a whole, it’s really detrimental that we can get funding. And it’s just not I mean, you can’t get money and you can’t convince people to give us money. So it’s kind of like a problem of like, we’re not being valued anymore. And so the money is being taken away, and then therefore it’s like, what do you do? So personally, this is forced me to try to finish a PhD way earlier than I would normally be allowed to do. A PhD usually takes 5 or 6 years and now I have to finish in four. So, you know, it’s stuff like that where you’re like, there just isn’t money. You got to, you have to, to if you’re a grad student and scrape by and figure out what you’re going to do over summer because to ships are really hard to get. And so, at a grad student level, it’s really hard. And on the more professor level, because a lot of the universities take like half of the money off the top from the NIH to like, fund, I don’t know, like our facilities and stuff. That’s like one of the cuts that I think Dodge is trying to do there. Like, they’re trying to do so many different things, but that was one of them. And then the university is like, well, then we can’t like keep these labs open. So it’s it’s this thing where right now even our PiS are like we were. We’re all like, how are we going to have jobs? Because industry is falling apart to here. So it’s kind of like all scientific jobs are kind of dwindling. And so as a community, we’re we’re all freaking out, basically, like, how do we how do we, especially those that have been in the field for so long, how do we go all our lives with, you know, sacrificing, you know, personal relationships, health and then be told that all of our, our time and energy and care is not valued and isn’t going to be funded. And it’s stuff that matters. Like it helps people. So it’s it’s really it’s just devastating to the scientific community. And a lot of us are like, I guess we like teach because even that’s not even secure or we move out of the country. So that’s kind of where the where the state of the field is, is in regards to finances and how to survive an administrative administration that is actively trying to destroy, this part of our, our or, I guess, our country and economy. And, you know, it’s kind of hard to say because it impacts so many different areas.
It’s been it’s been longer than that. It also has to do with the cost of goods. So when you’re doing like the NIH is keeping up, wasn’t keeping up with the cost of how much it is to pay us pay for goods. And so they were keeping the pay line really low. So you’re keeping the pay line like it hasn’t changed since the 90s. And inflation is insane and people cost more to exist. It’s like that’s where the downward trend is. Like they’re not giving any more. They’ve also like the Bush administration did a little bit taking away. And then you have like the influx between different administrations that are like, I’m going to take a little way and give a little bit back. And it’s like that. Those combination of things have been going on for like the last 30 years. I hope I answered your question.
Yeah. So I’ll start on like the day to day, I guess roughly. So a lot of things like that we would normally do to, really like expand on our project and do follow up studies you can’t perform. It’s costly or like if we have like big like genomics or informatics studies. And now we can’t really afford to do them because they cost like they cost several thousand dollars. And you have to pay for computational power. So you have to like make do with, you know, the tools you have that are really cheap and effective and then you can’t really dive into what’s happening on the pathway level. So you’re kind of like, you’re doing the best you can, but you can’t really expand out, if that makes sense. And so you can’t, you may not be able to do a lot of the experiments that you normally could be able to do that would really help us drive home your point and help expand what the field really knows. You can’t really, you can’t have PhD students actually stay as long as you would need them to do, to be here. You can’t. You might if you’re a smaller lab like ours. because we’re really tiny. The bigger our labs can, like, crush you, and then you might never even get your paper published. So it can be like long term impacts of all these smaller labs that focus on, you know, just mentoring like 2 or 3 scientists at a time get crushed by the huge labs that are funded through external sources like Howard Hughes, which is like a huge institute. Not many people can get into it. So you have like, mostly these big labs that can still like, you know, crank out papers and like, crush the little guy. So it kind of makes it inequitable in the long run. And that feeds into a whole other issue of inequality and inequity in science in general. But it just like crushes the little guy is trying to just produce and, you know, come up with good science. And then I guess on more of like an institutional level, you just have a loss of a lot of labs that don’t have a ton of external funding that isn’t through the NIH. So it’s just like a slowly like, I don’t I think like most of the labs would just be converted to those PiS are just teaching instead of running a lab because they can’t afford to in the long term. So those are like the actual impacts to a lab. If you can’t do the experiments you need to do. It’s harder to publish papers. And then you start to have just the decrease in, you know, the range and diversity of research because people can’t keep their labs open. And then another big impact is we can’t recruit PhD students. So now instead of admitting like 15 or 20, we’re meeting like two, or like, maybe we skip next year and you’re like, what the hell? This is like people’s futures. This is people that obviously deserve to fulfill their dreams. So it’s all a broad impact of it trickles down to everyone and then, of course, to the economy. Because we’re a huge we make we buy a lot of shit. So it helps the economy a lot. For lack of better term. It’s just we consume a lot and we really feed into the economy. And now it’s like tanking it. Hope that help to answer your question.
It definitely could impact those. I think that It a lot of things that we do and there’s like a big move towards this like mentality of like team scientists where you get together like I’m the the geneticist and then you have like, I’m the neuroscientist and you have like the clinician that’s like, I’m with the patients. And, that can really disrupt that workflow. If you have like smaller labs that are really niche and focused and really good at one thing like our lab is and they can’t they’re like losing money and they can’t really participate in team science. So that’s one aspect. And then if you don’t, have a lot of NIH grants, sometimes you can’t do translational research and do drug discovery. Because a lot of those labs rely on that, not just private foundations. So it has like a broader impact that will eventually go out to the patients. And that’s where, like, I’m concerned because there’s a lot of rare diseases and it’s like the federal government’s like, no, no, no, don’t worry about that. It’s like, excuse me, that’s thousands of people. And, you know, it impacts everyone if you don’t if you start taking away these things. The NIH funds most of science, most biology in the US. So it’s just it’s going to impact so many different things we work on developing every year. It will impact all the little labs doing foundational research, like the basic stuff that will feed into like maybe even vaccine development and stuff like that, or will be factored into chemotherapies, which is like a whole other part of my lab that works on doing the small molecule analysis to try to understand how to treat cancers. Like that impacts people and it impacts patients, and it impacts your ability to work together and collaborate. Because we can’t exist. We can’t. We can’t. If you can’t do an experiment and then share those results with the scientist. Or if somebody gives you a good idea at a conference and you can’t come back and actually execute it, you’re going to have impacts. And it like clinical trials are really important. So those feed in between like a basic research lab like mine, a translational research lab, and then the clinic, all those that chain gets screwed up at some part because of offset NIH funds.
[Another point is that] a lot of our undergraduate researchers are also on NIH fellowships, like a chunk of my research team that are undergraduates are losing their funding. And it also has to do with the Dei programs being destroyed and being like, we’re not allowed to put diversity, equity and inclusion in our grants anymore. So stuff like this, it’s not just it’s not just patients, it’s just not other scientists, but it’s the future scientists we’re destroying. We’re really destroying their chances. So that’s something that, like, definitely keeps me up at night. Besides the patients and my future is that I all these wonderful students I can’t like. They would have good mentors and be able to see a prosperous future. Are getting their futures are getting kind of like poofed away. So it’s another whole other thing is like it like bleeds out everywhere, bleeds out to the community. We can’t do community outreach events and all this. And just like I think people forget, like, it’s not just like the science and the clinicians and us all working together to cure something, but a lot of us work with undergraduate researchers, high school students, and then go out into the community and educate the community on different scientific topics. It’s expansive. It it just, like devastates a lot of facets.
Yeah, so I haven’t heard of many people deciding to change fields. They’ve thought about I know a lot of people are talking about just going into education, but we also have a whole defunding of education. So there’s like not a lot of options when you’re like, especially if you’re leaving a PhD and you’re like, I can it’s like, okay, I don’t know what to do. I know a lot of people are going into policy now. But I’m like, good luck with that. Given the situation. I know personally I’ve been recruited by other countries, like I get targeted ads a lot for like, Denmark and Norway. And yeah, I think a lot of us are considering leaving because it’s it’s we don’t there’s not funding. And our jobs are reliant on this, even especially with the industry, like biotech industry tanking right now. It’s kind of like, okay, Now we don’t have even that to fall on. And there’s only so many policy jobs. I yeah, but I definitely get specifically targeted. And I know other people that get targeted by ads like come Norway has all these universities or Denmark is like also definitely targeting us or like eyes like, here you go. I heard you say us is not funding you. So, that’s definitely a thing a lot of people are considering, especially like people like me, that are going to be transitioning out of the PhD life soon. So it’s a lot of people thinking like that or a lot of people that are just like, I guess I’ll just have to hop from job to job, or I’ll just like, like fight for a postdoctoral position. Opposition. And so then it gets more cutthroat. And it’s kind of like one of those things where a lot of people are like, well, apply like anywhere in the US, because we all have family here. But a lot of us are like, what’s what the fuck? Sorry. Like, it’s just like, what’s the point if these repercussions usually have long lasting impacts? So a lot of us are like just going to apply anywhere in the world and just, you know, hope that what we’re seeing in Europe is they’re like, maybe going to plot out out money to like, recruit us, that that will actually be true and that we’ll be able to have more opportunity in Europe or in Australia or New Zealand. So it’s kind of like all of us are just like anywhere, I guess, because there’s no jobs. (..) Yeah, a lot of us are just considering leaving or, like, fighting tooth and nail just to get, you know, a job that probably isn’t, you know, what we would be making before or is it something we actually want to do?
I think I think I can kind of see. I think, I think I want to ask a clarifying question. Yeah. So mostly, are you referring to, how the administration is going to be treating like, how my educational experience was probably different than the new generation and the events of everything and how that’s specifically being impacted?
Yeah, I could, I could foresee that maybe in the next five years, because right now a lot of the students are, like, committed on the path, or in a lot of students think they’re pre-med, and then they’ll be they’ll realize, you know, no, thank you. Or they can’t get into med school here or anywhere. So they switch to, you know, like I’m going to be a scientist. But, yeah, like, a lot of these opportunities, they’re it’s mostly like, we’re all trying to. It’s hard to say what’s going to happen, because we’re all trying to fight and use appropriate language with the NIH to get money for them, and which is honestly been a challenge personally for me. But, yeah, I think it’s going to be a totally different experience where it’s going to lead people to, you know, maybe not want to go to college, or people not wanting to even touch Stem as a field. Specifically the biology. I think engineering might be okay. (..) Chemistry will definitely be impacted, I think, because so much of it interplays with us and the EPA, the FDA, all of those things are like chemistry and biology, pretty much. And I think the only ones that are safe is engineering. So I think we might have like an influx of engineers. And then people wanted to, you know, maybe do marketing or something. It’s hard to say where they’re going to go because a lot of, you know, a lot of students are actually really like biology. And I don’t know what they’re going to do with this if there’s no prospect of a job afterwards.
I think they’re trying to privatize a lot of stuff. And basically the impact is going to be anyone that isn’t like in the upper class is not going to have opportunity. So it’s really causing a discrepancy in who has the potential opportunity. And that’s why we have government. Or at least that was my perception of why we have government is to try to like in an ideal world, we would try to help each other and to some extent and give some opportunity. And so I think it removes a lot of that. And I don’t think you can rely on the kindness of the 1% to fund us. Like they’re not going to do that. I mean, like you could they there’s already it’s it’s just going to be privatized. And then that forces like certain type of research, if that makes sense, like it’s constricting versus like if you have a federal grant, if as long as you’re hitting your targets, it’s like they don’t give a shit because you’re doing good science, you’re targeting, you’re hitting all your goals. You said what you’re going to do. Cool. You’re going to like move on and add value to that and like advance science in that area versus like you could if you’re being privatized, you’re being forced to go a certain direction. You have stakeholders. You have to like, cater to them versus usually if it’s federally funded, yeah, you have to get approved and you have to go through the long grant process. But it’s not as restricting where you’re like suddenly like being narrowed into, like, you can only do this. I think Howard Hughes isn’t very much like that. They’re like, here’s five years of funding. Go do your research. Just report back to us. But if more there’s more companies that do this privatize research, you’re going to definitely like have just more like almost like businesses potentially. But even then it’s like it’s hard to say what’s going to happen. But I think privatizing research isn’t going to be helpful. And it’s going to be less inclusive of, of all, almost all people. It’s kind of like not useful in my opinion, if you can’t bring everybody to the table.
I feel like… I feel like it’s hard to say what what to anticipate, really, especially when things don’t really actually make logical sense. So it seems like perhaps there’ll be, I don’t really foresee a lot of private funding. But I know from experience and from colleagues that if you’re funded by a foundation or like a like a family, the families that will literally throw money at a disease, it’s a totally different feeling of doing research. And it like it’s really driven by certain directions sometimes. As for like defunding things, I think it’s a combination, really. You’re defunding general science that is going to help, you know, maybe lead to more insight for translational research. It’s just I think it’s like the combination, really, if it gets down to it, it’s you’re probably going to have more privatized research that’s being, like skewed towards a specific niche. And then a lot you can’t do like a lot of research will be like, oh, how does this expand just beyond my disease? And that’s like what makes the science powerful is if you’re able to, like, increase the impact. So I think it will kind of force like that mindset of how can we like, how can we not just like, focus on one thing and make the world better for that specific issue, but like to all these other issues? I think it just narrows it. And then also defunds a lot of science that, is really hard to get money for sometimes or that is always reliant on the NIH know who’s going to pay for that? Who’s going to fund that?
Yeah, it’s really hard to say what thing I’d like to emphasize most. (..) I, I feel like it’s really. (..) A cacophony of bullshit that we’re experiencing. And it impacts not just. And we all know it doesn’t just impact the US. It impacts everybody globally. So, I think right now, (..) Living in the US, it’s kind of like I think the thing that I wish to emphasize is like, you know, there’s a reason why we’re funded and we global. It’s like it’s not just impacting people and people’s health. It’s not just impacting my career. It’s impacting, you know, it’s impacting all the future research that’s going to happen that’s impacting the opportunity for individuals. It’s impacting the economy globally, and it’s also impacting our ability to respond to diseases as we go. So I think like it’s really critical that you fund something that impacts the community, the economy, education and health. It hits everything. So that’s kind of where I would like to emphasize a lot of us don’t want to leave the US because there’s a lot of great research here. Like, also, this is our home. Like we don’t want to leave. But, you know, if there’s no opportunity, and we’re not valued and people don’t want to listen to us when we’ve dedicated our life to this, it’s kind of like, well, we’re not going to, you know, belabor our points. Point. You know, it’s like hitting your head against a wall.","July 14, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/human-story-american-scientists-in-search-of-safe-harbor/,Marshall Everett,thenewglobalorder.com,World News
The rise of Morocco as an industrial Hub: opportunities and challenges,"Morocco has become a strategic destination for foreign investments, particularly in the automotive and battery sectors. The sophisticated transportation system, and the large reserves of phosphates – essential for car batteries – have leveraged its position in the international competition. Due to a six-year drought that pushed farmers out of agriculture, the country offers a growing, affordable labour force, but despite the growth potential, a new wave of protectionist measures threatens the free access to the European market. The increasing Chinese investments in the country play a role in it.

Morocco’s real GDP growth has remained steady since 2023, growing at a3% rate.What changed is the composition of the economic drivers. Indeed, while the prolonged drought severely affected the agriculture sector, accelerating its transformation, the secondary sector accelerated the growth.
Morocco has become a rising player in global manufacturing, thanks to its booming automotive sector and strategic foreign investment. The car industry registered an increase of6.3% in 2024,followed by aeronautics, and phosphate and derivatives. Over 260 auto factories are in the country, which created more than 170,000 direct jobs by 2023. Yet, this growth was mainly driven by multinational companies. Foreign investors dominate high-value segments like engine assembly and electronic systems. Moroccan firms mostly handle lower-value tasks such as wiring and seating, which proves the limited engagement of domestic suppliers.
Low-cost labour and natural resources attract foreign direct investments, but enhance the risks of falling into the middle-income trap. It calls for national programs to improve education and training, to support the shift into higher-value local production. Close to these internal challenges, Morocco must navigate through the changing international equilibrium.
Since 2006, Morocco has been the only African country with aFree Trade Agreementwith the United States. The two countries also operate in the field of regional security, counterterrorism, and military coordination – e.g.,“African Lion”, a co-joint series of military exercises since 2007.
On March 25th, the U.S. House of Representatives praised the “longstanding friendship” with Morocco, ahead of the 250th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2027. Resolution 251 celebrates the importance of the relationship in promoting “mutual economic and security interests”. Still, Morocco was not exempted from Trump-era tariffs to reduce the US’ trade deficit. Thanks to the goods trade surplus, which rose to 3.4 billion in 2024, Morocco was charged only with a 10% tariff – the lowest rate among the MENA countries. As a result, it maintains its advantage as a cost-effective firm’s destination in the wake of Trump’s second administration.
Meanwhile, China’s investments in the country are increasing. Beijing has been strengthening its ties with Morocco since 2016, marking a new phase in bilateral relations. The visit in November by Xi Jinping, after the G20 summit in Brazil, represents a step forward in their economic relationship. Investments from Chinese companies in the electric vehicle (EV) and battery sector have achieved $10 billion in the last years.
In November 2024, the “Caisse de dépot et de gestion” (CDG) – a state-owned financial institution that manages long-term savings in Morocco – signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chinese giant Gotion High-Tech. They committed to the partnership for the construction of the Kenitra gigafactory project, a$1.3 billionbattery production plant.
The EU is closely watching Morocco’s growing industrial role and its links to China. In2021, the European Commission investigated glass fibre fabrics (GFF) from China routed through Morocco.Chinese firmswere importing raw materials, processing them locally, then exporting to the EU, in an attempt to overcome anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. Indeed, the EU took action to protect its automotive sector, increasing tariffs on China’s EVs to45%.
Similarly, the EC has taken action against unfair trade practices involving imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco. In2023, the EU confirmed anti-dumping duties of 9% to 17.5%. Additionally,in March 2025, it added countervailing duties of 5.6% to 31.4% after finding illegal Moroccan subsidies, through grants, tax exemptions, and low-interest loans, incompatible with WTO rules. Financial contribution from China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), directly benefiting one of the Moroccan exporters, further aggravated the situation.
These trade defence measures reflect the EU’s efforts to protect key industrial sectors from unfair trade practices. The GFF market alone represents an annual value of €300 million within the EU and supports over 2,000 jobs. Similarly, the European aluminium wheel industry employs approximately 17,000 people. The EU’s actions aim not only to safeguard these industries from immediate harm but also to address broader geopolitical dynamics. In particular, they target China’s strategy of gaining indirect access to the European market through third countries like Morocco. The combination of trade defense measures highlights the EU’s concern over this indirect penetration and its commitment to maintaining a level playing field in global trade.
The recent wave of tariffs on China has further accelerated the regionalisation of Chinese supply chains in Morocco. The country’s strategic location near Europe, combined with its free trade agreement with the EU, positions it as agatewayto the European automotive market. This has made Morocco an increasingly attractive base for Chinese firms seeking to bypass trade restrictions.
China’s expansion into third countries to overcome internal and external trade barriers is already visible. A clear example isMexico’s response to U.S. pressure to tighten generous incentives for carmakers, highlighting the global competition between the two largest economies. Morocco now finds itself in a similar position, caught between growing foreign investment and tightening Western protectionism.
As Morocco continues to industrialise, it must navigate these global trade dynamics carefully. The country faces the challenge of leveraging foreign investment without becoming merely a low-cost production zone. Success will depend on its ability to upgrade its industrial base, deepen domestic supply chains, and maintain balanced trade relationships with both East and West.","July 04, 2025",https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/the-rise-of-morocco-as-an-industrial-hub-opportunities-and-challenges/,Anna Milano,thenewglobalorder.com,Other Articles
